Unchecked exceptions are alright if you want to handle every failure the same way, for example by logging it and skipping to the next request, displaying a message to the user and handling the next event, etc. If this is my use case, all I have to do is catch some general exception type at a high level in my system, and handle everything the same way. But I want to recover from specific problems, and I'm not sure the best way to approach it with unchecked exceptions. Here is a concrete example. Suppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my "action", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I'd really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same "we logged your problem but for now you're hosed" message. Here are a few points to consider: There a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously. I don't want to lock the whole user table between a "SELECT" to see if the name exists and an "INSERT" if it doesn't. In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I'm really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won't work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc. Given my CTO's propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in "Inc.", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions? One of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to "handle" them in every call on the stack—either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system–based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch IOException, while a database implementation would catch SQLException, but both would throw a UserNotFoundException that hides the underlying implementation. How do I take advantage of unchecked exceptions, sparing myself of the burden of this wrapping at each layer, without leaking implementation details?
I am writing a client-side Swing application (graphical font designer) on Java 5. Recently, I am running into java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error because I am not being conservative on memory usage. The user can open unlimited number of files, and the program keeps the opened objects in the memory. After a quick research I found Ergonomics in the 5.0 Java Virtual Machine and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as 64MB. Given this situation, how should I deal with this constraint? I could increase the max heap size using command line option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some finite max does not ultimately get rid of the issue. I could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it's probably a lot work too. If you could point me to details of above ideas or some alternatives like automatic virtual memory, extending heap size dynamically, that will be great.
Our team has been experiencing a recurring problem with velocity templates. Upon rendering, some throw a RuntimeException with the message "Template.merge() failure - Unable to render Velocity Template, '/template.vm'". We have not been able to reproduce the problem and the documentation on the web is pretty insufficient. The problem is not consistently reproducible - the same templates whose rendering sometimes causes the error also manage to display without problems at other times. The Template class source code is also of little help. Thank you in advance. Edit: Based on Nathan Bubna's response I need to clarify that we are using Velocity version 1.4. Edit: Since it was pointed out that a stack trace would be beneficial, here it is: 2008-09-15 11:07:57,336 ERROR velocity - Template.merge() failure. The document is null, most likely due to parsing error. 2008-09-15 11:07:57,336 ERROR VelocityResult - Unable to render Velocity Template, '/search/[template-redacted].vm' java.lang.Exception: Template.merge() failure.

(I've asked the same question of the jmeter-user mailing list, but I wanted to try here as well - so at the least I can update this with the answer once I find it). I'm having trouble using JMeter to test a Tomcat webapp using a self-signed SSL cert. JMeter throws a SocketException with message Unconnected sockets not implemented. According to JMeter's docs, the application is designed and written to accept any certificate, self-signed or CA signed or whatever. Has anyone run into this specific exception before? I've attempted to export this certificate from the server and import it into my local keystore (with keytool -import -alias tomcat -file ), but the result is the same. I've also tried setting javax.net.debug=all as a JVM arg (the JSSE reference guide lists this as a debugging step); however, I don't see any debugging output anywhere - should I expect this somewhere other than standard out/error?
I have recently changed an application from storing the database username and password in a configuration file (gasp password stored in plain text in a config file). The application now asks the user to type in her username and password before it can continue. The new version of the application now has to interrogate the SQLException to determine what caused the exception (invalid user name or password, database server unreachable, connection timeout, etc.) so that it can decide what to do next (prompt the user to correct the username and password, tell the user to try again later once the network issue has been sorted, reconnect invisibly, etc.). Trying to find the SQLException errorCodes (SQLException.getErrorCode()) that relate to these (and other) causes has been near to impossible and we have been forced to guessing (which at times can be dangerous). The Java API docs say this is vendor-specific. Does anyone have the error-codes that can be set by the Sybase JConnect JDBC drivers? JRE 1.5 jConnect for JDBC 2.0 (spec version 5.2) Sybase IQ 12.7
I'm writing some JNI code in C++ to be called from an applet on Windows XP. I've been able to successfully run the applet and have the JNI library loaded and called, even going so far as having it call functions in other DLLs. I got this working by setting up the PATH system environment variable to include the directory all of my DLLs are in. So, the problem, is that I add another call that uses a new external DLL, and suddenly when loading the library, an UnsatisfiedLinkError is thrown. The message is: 'The specified procedure could not be found'. This doesn't seem to be a problem with a missing dependent DLL, because I can remove a dependent DLL and get a different message about dependent DLL missing. From what I've been able to find online, it appears that this message means that a native Java function implementation is missing from the DLL, but it's odd that it works fine without this extra bit of code. Does anyone know what might be causing this? What kinds of things can give a 'The specified procedure could not be found' messages for an UnsatisifedLinkError?
As a new Eclipse user, I am constantly annoyed by how long it takes compiler error messages to display. This is mostly only a problem for long errors that don't fit in the status bar or the "Problems" tab. But I get enough long errors in Java—especially with generics—that this is a nagging issue. (Note: The correct answer to this question is not "get better at using generics." ;-) The ways I have found to display an error are: Press Ctrl+. or execute the command "Next Annotation". The next error is highlighted and its associated message appears in the status bar (if it is short enough). The error is also highlighted in the "Problems" tab, if it is open, but the tab is not automatically brought to the top. Hover the mouse over the error. After a noticeable lag, the error message appears as a "tool tip", along with any associated "Quick Fixes." Hover the mouse over the error icon on the left side of the editing pane. After a noticeable lag, all of the error messages for that line appear as a "tool tip." Clicking on the icon brings up "Quick Fixes." What I would like is for Ctrl+. to automatically and instantly bring up the complete error message (I don't care where). Is this a configurable option? [UPDATE] @asterite's "Ctrl+. F2" is almost it. How do I make "Next Annotation, then Show Tooltip Description" a macro bound to a single keystroke?
We're running a web app on Tomcat 6 and Apache mod_proxy 2.2.3. Seeing a lot of 502 errors like this: Bad Gateway! The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server. The proxy server could not handle the request GET /the/page.do. Reason: Error reading from remote server If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster. Error 502 Tomcat has plenty of threads, so it's not thread-constrained. We're pushing 2400 users via JMeter against the app. All the boxes are sitting inside our firewall on a fast unloaded network, so there shouldn't be any network problems. Anyone have any suggestions for things to look at or try? We're heading to tcpdump next. UPDATE 10/21/08: Still haven't figured this out. Seeing only a very small number of these under load. The answers below haven't provided any magical answers...yet. :)
We use Eclipse for our Java development, and we've got Maven compiling our JSPs into servlets to be used in our embedded Jetty instance. This means that to run the project from Eclipse, I have to include ./target/jsp-source as a source folder, which works great. The warnings that show up for that generated code are everywhere though, and I want to filter them out. mainMenu_jsp.java has a warning about a local variable not being used. It's generated code, so I don't care about it, but I can't figure out how to filter out any warnings by filename pattern. I know I can define a working set, but because I'm always opening,closing, and sometimes adding and deleting projects, I don't want another point of manual bookkeeping that I have to keep up to date. If I add a new project and forget to go in and add it to the working set, I won't get any warnings for it, which with all the other projects, I might not notice. Working sets would only really work if there was a way to set them to dynamically expand to include all projects (not just all right now), and have their filtering automatically apply to each new project as it's added.
I have a question regarding handling errors in a J2EE application. Our current application is in use by many many users and as a result we get a lot of support tickets. Most of these tickets are user-related but 5-10% are system related exceptions, unhandled errors, etc. We have the basic exception handling checks in the code (needs works), but from my experience showing a generic message to the user doesn't help the troubleshooting process to be expedited. What I'm looking for is a recommendation on a good error handling design pattern so that let's consider a scenario: Code has an error Error is handled User is shown a non-technical error message with a specific error code. Non-tech Support team can use this error code to see the area (page, section, ..) in the application where this happened and what the user might have been doing (information prepopulated by dev team in a customer support reference guide). Tech support team can use the code to zero right in on the class/JSP etc and line of code which trigged that exception. We use a logging module where most (not all) Tomcat stdout errors are logged by user session ... to the error code the user will receive we can include the log ID if it exists as well so that the tech team can look at that too. Basically what I'm interested is to reduce the support analysis-explanation-research cycle and give every department access to the information at their fingertips which can get them started faster for their respective jobs: Customer support can give a canned explanation for this error code or have alternative steps the user could follow. Tech team could start troubleshooting the line of code or what the user was doing which triggered that line. Essential each error code triggers of the required next-steps for each department and in effect reducing the research phase of the issue and moving to the solution phase. I'm not sure if the above is even a good idea. Any suggestions would be appreciated on a good "design pattern" for such a need. Or if it would even be a good route to look at. Thanks in advance. SP
We're creating a web system using Java and Servlet technology (actually Wicket for the presentation layer) and we need our system to be available nearly always as our customers will be quite dependent on it. This has lead us to look for a good book focusing on the subject or another resource which explains how to set up a more redundant and fail safe architecture for our system. A non exclusive list of questions we have at the moment: How do you have one domain name (like http://www.google.com) which are actually served by several servers with load balancing to distribute the users? Isn't there always a point which is weaker in such a solution(the two [as there can't be more] DNS servers for google.com in their case)? It seems like a good idea to have several database servers for redundancy and load balancing. How is that set up? If one of our web servers goes down we would like to have some kind of fail over and let users use one that is still up. Amongst other things the sessions have to be synchronized in some way. How is that set up? Do we need some kind of synchronized transactions too? Is Amazon Computer Cloud a good option for us? How do we set it up there? Are there any alternatives which are cost effective? Do we need to run in a Java EE container like JBoss or Glassfish?
I am working on a J2ME project that spawns worker threads for numerous tasks such as downloading HTTP content. The basic thread layout is similar to most java apps--there is a main UI thread and worker threads spawned to do stuff behind the scenes. My question is what is the best way to handle exceptions that occur in the worker threads? I usually adhere to the design rationale that most exceptions should be percolate as far as possible. When I write single threaded apps, it is common for me to percolate the exceptions all the way up to the UI layer and then report them in an error dialog to the user. Is there a similar practice for multithreaded apps? The most intuitive thing to me is to catch exceptions in the Thread.run() and then call an invokeLater on the UI thread to report it in a dialog. The issue I see here is that outside of the worker thread dying off prematurely, this approach does not really notify the UI thread there was an error. I do not see a clear way to throw an exception across threads so to speak. Thanks, Andy
Question: Is exception handling in Java actually slow? Conventional wisdom, as well as a lot of Google results, says that exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow in Java. Two reasons are usually given, its really slow - even an order of magnitude slower than regular code (the reasons given vary), and its messy because people expect only errors to be handled in exceptional code. This question is about #1. As an example, this page describes Java exception handling as "very slow" and relates the slowness to the creation of the exception message string - "this string is then used in creating the exception object that is thrown. This is not fast." The article Effective Exception Handling in Java says that "the reason for this is due to the object creation aspect of exception handling, which thereby makes throwing exceptions inherently slow". Another reason out there is that the stack trace generation is what slows it down. My testing (using Java 1.6.0_07, Java HotSpot 10.0, on 32 bit Linux), indicates that exception handling is no slower than regular code. I tried running a method in a loop that executes some code. At the end of the method, I use a boolean to indicate whether to return or throw. This way the actual processing is the same. I tried running the methods in different orders and averaging my test times, thinking it may have been the JVM warming up. In all my tests, the throw was at least as fast as the return, if not faster (up to 3.1% faster). I am completely open to the possibility that my tests were wrong, but I haven't seen anything out there in the way of code sample, test comparisons, or results in the last year or two that show exception handling in Java to actually be slow. What lead me down this path was an API I needed to use that threw exceptions as part of normal control logic. I wanted to correct them in their usage, but now I may not be able to. Will I instead have to praise them on their forward thinking? In the paper Efficient Java exception handling in just-in-time compilation, the authors suggest that the presence of exception handlers alone, even if no exceptions are thrown, is enough to prevent the JIT compiler from optimizing the code properly, thus slowing it down. I haven't tested this theory yet.

So I started with a web services project (just a dynamic web project) that builds and debugs correctly from eclipse. We've pulled a chunk of common code out that we want to put into a shared library so now those classes are going into a separate jar project that the web project references. On the web project, I did Project->Properties->Java Build Path->Projects->Add and added the jar project. And this correctly solved all the compile-time classpath problems and everything builds fine. But at runtime, when the tomcat server fires up, spring attempts to inject some of the classes contained in the jar file and I get a NoClassDefFoundError. My .class and properties files and the contents of my META-INF directory are showing up in the ./build directory, but my WEB-INF/lib directory seems to be referenced in-place, and the jar dependency doesn't get copied in to it to show up as part of the Web App Library. What is the magical incantation to tell eclipse that the other jar project needs to be available to tomcat at runtime? From our ant build script, we first just build the other project into WEB-INF/lib and everything works fine, but not for eclipse debugging.
I was wondering if something exists (in Java world) able to take an snapshot of the JVM current state with the following features: Do it while an exception is being thrown. Capture local variables, method's arguments, etc. Put it in a handy file which can be used to extract or reproduce in a IDE the situation in your source code. The two first features are required (third would be awesome). And it must be suitable for production use (so, there is no way about debuggers). Before asking this I've searched through the WWW (as long as possible) and I found some pointers: Cajoon Interceptor: As said in Dzone post, it's a passive JVM agent which fulfill the three requirements! But, it has two downsides: you must pay for it and the site is down (maybe there is no chance to pay anything). AviCode Intercept Studio: Cajoon's .NET equivalent. Just to give some insight about. JavaFrame: Ok, it's a tweet, but it points to a available SVN repo which have the source code (under MIT license) of a JVM agent which looks fine (I'm going to give a try to it). So, maybe I'm looking for a non existent solution? It's not urgent, but I had this idea for a project and it would be great to explore this "unknown" (?) path and get something real. It seems to be clear that it would be a JVM agent (exception event from JVMTI, for example). At last, I would highlight the followin paragraph from Wikipedia's Exception Handling article: In runtime engine environments such as Java or .NET, there exist tools that attach to the runtime engine and every time that an exception of interest occurs, they record debugging information that existed in memory at the time the exception was thrown (call stack and heap values). These tools are called Automated Exception Handling or Error Interception tools and provide 'root-cause' information for exceptions. That's the idea. I hope somebody can give me some insight or maybe, in the future, somebody get inspired by this humble post :) Thanks!
How can I indicate syntax errors (e.g. an illegal sequence of tokens) in an eclipse editor plugin just like in the eclipse Java editor, i.e. by red wriggly underlines, a red marker on the scrollbar that you can jump to, and an explanatory message when you hover over either one? I'm writing an eclipse editor plugin for a custom file format (specifically, the "snake file format" of the Shark3D game engine). I have implemented a scanner to get syntax highlighting, and an outline. For the underlines, do I simply have the scanner return an IToken with a "wriggly underline" TextAttribute instead of the normal one, or is there a specific mechanism for marking syntax errors? How do I implement the scrollbar markers? Is IAnnotationModel the relevant interface here? If so, where do I register the implementation so that the markers appear? I've only found SourceViewerConfiguration.getAnnotationHover(), which would allow me to implement the hover behaviour, but only for the "annotation", which I suppose means the scrollbar markers - how do I implement the hover behaviour for the text itself? I'd be happy specific advice as well as an URL of a tutorial that covers this - the eclipse help documents and examples don't seem to. Edit: Markers are the best solutions to this. A working example of how to use them can be found in the plugin example code in org.eclipse.ui.examples.readmetool.AddReadmeMarkerAction
I am working on a project that is using a JTable to display, among other things, a column of dates. We needed validation for the user input for dates, so I have implemented a combination of masking for format validation and parsing for actual date validation. I have done this using a custom CellEditor for the date column. Inside my MaskedCellEditor, I have a JFormattedTextField. I setup the masking for dates. Then I add an InputVerifier to allow for actual validation. My InputVerifier implements verify() to check: 1. textField.isEditValid() 2. DateValidator.ValidDate(). If either is invalid, verify returns false and the InputVerifier locks the focus into the text field (the cell editor) and a small message dialog is displayed reminding the user of the date format. The error message is a small, undecorated, non-modal, non-focusable JDialog that pops up underneath the cell being edited. It disappears on a keypress or a successful date verification. It is working great except for a small edge case. If the user selects a menu button on the top of the application while an invalid edit has popped up the dialog, it switches screens, destroying everything currently on the screen (including the table). However, since the dialog is being shown and a keypress/successful edit has not occurred, the dialog is never hidden. It remains visible in a completely unrelated context on a different screen. Once the user has switched off the screen with the table, there is no way for the user to get rid of the dialog. I have debated throwing either a Timer and/or a MouseListener on the dialog itself that would cause it to disappear, but I feel that I am ignoring the actual problem. The dialog is never being disposed of and I am pretty sure its because it is still set to be visible and it is preventing the garbage collector from getting rid of it. I have a Cleanup method on the panel holding the JTable, but I cannot find a good way to reference the dialog (a component of the InputVerifier) in order to get rid of it. The dialog is pretty far removed from the table's parent panel. (Panel -> JTable -> CellEditor -> JFormattedTextField -> InputVerifier -> JDialog) Any ideas on how to force the dialog to be hidden when the table is destroyed? If you need more details, let me know. I'm trying not to get you guys bogged down in the details, but there is a lot going on.
I'm just coming up the learning curve for Java SE & have no problem with the usual Java convention for package names, e.g. com.example.library_name_here.package_name_here Except. I've been noticing a failure to abide by this in some fairly well-known packages. JLine: jline.* JACOB: com.jacob.* (there is no jacob.com) JNA: com.sun.jna.* (disclaimer on the site says NOTE: Sun is not sponsoring this project, even though the package name (com.sun.jna) might imply otherwise.) So I'm wondering, are there instances where the usual reverse-domain-name convention breaks down, and there are good ways to get around it? The only cases I can think of revolve around domain-name ownership issues (e.g. you change the project hosting/domain name, or there's already a well-known package that has "squatter's rights" to your domain, or your ownership of the domain runs out & someone else snaps it up). edit: if I use my company's domain name, and we are bought out or have a spin-off, what should we do with package names? keep them the same or rename? (I suppose renaming is bad from the point of view that compiled classes referring to the package then lose)
Hey all, I'm pulling my hair out on this one. I've checked all my permissions, on both the database server (SQL Server 2000) and the file system to ensure that what I am trying to do should be possible. Here's the situation: I have a Java EE web application running on a Tomcat server on my company's intranet. Long story short, this application crunches numbers, creates a pipe-delimited file of records to be BULK INSERTed into our database, and saves the file on the UNIX server. Then a stored procedure is called which utilizes xp_cmdshell to FTP the file from UNIX to our Windows SQL Server box in order to BULK INSERT the file. When I call this stored procedure (logged in as the tomcat user that we run our web app from) from Management Studio, there is not a single error, and the FTP transfers, and the file is loaded. This is the part that is aggravating me. When the Java EE app calls this stored procedure, it actually FTPs the file to the SQL Server box, but I end up with a SQLServerException even upon success. No rhyme or reason. BUT...even though the exception is thrown, my file ends up on the server all nice and cosy. Does SQL Server have an issue with running xp_cmdshell from a UNIX server (as ludicrous as this sounds to me, since all the program is doing is calling a stored procedure, I am still at the office at 11:55PM on a Tuesday night, so I guess nothing is too ludicrous...) Any insight would be great... EDIT: Also, I have been viewing the traffic to SQL Server using SQL Profiler...and I can see the actual statement I am using to call the stored procedure. When I copy that into SQL Server Management Studio and execute it using my tomcat user credentials it executes flawlessly...
I'm developing an editor plugin for eclipse. It works fine on files within eclipse projects, but when an external file is opened via the "File -> Open File" menu (which works file with, e.g. Java files), I get a page displaying nothing but a horizontal blue line and the word "ERROR". The Error Log of eclipse is empty, as is the log file in the .metadata directory. What could cause this? How can I diagnose the error when I have no error message that tells me where to look? There doesn't seem to be a way to get more detailed logging from eclipse. Edit: I've found that the source of the problem is close to what jamesh mentioned, but not a ClassCastException - there simply is no IDocument instance for the text viewer to display because StorageDocumentProvider.createDocument() returns null. The reason for this is that it only knows how to create documents for instances of org.eclipse.ui.IStorageEditorInput, but in this case it gets an instance of org.eclipse.ui.ide.FileStoreEditorInput, which does not implement that interface, but instead implements org.eclipse.ui.IURIEditorInput
I have a small (500kb) swing applet that displays small HTML page with JEditorPane. This works nicely with most browsers and JREs, but with JRE 1.5 (IE6) it seem to display just blank. There are no error messages on java console or exceptions. Applet is able to load TXT files with all JREs just fine, with JAVA CONSOLE tracing 5 option it displays the same diagnostic message for both text files and html files: network: Connecting https://xxx.net/xxx/data/my.txt with proxy=DIRECT network: Connecting https://xxx.net/xxx/data/my2.htm with proxy=DIRECT Any ideas how to diagnose further whats going wrong, or how to fix it? I don't have console access to my client's server hosting the applet, but I have a test machine with IE6+JRE 1.5 that I can use to access their HTTPS url and reproduce the problem. The problem does not appear with other browsers / JRE 1.6. Applet is unsigned since the HTML page and applet are located in same folder in same server.
I'm using reflection to add some data to a private variable inside a class from a third-party library. Along the way there are about four different Exceptions that can be thrown; all of them are related to reflection, and all of them are very unlikely to occur. I'm hardcoding the name of the class and variable involved. I'm unlikely to receive any class not found or field not found errors, unless the library gets upgraded some day and has changed significantly. I'd rather not declare all four of these exceptions for my caller to handle. He's likely to never see them. I'd like to just catch all of these and throw another exception to say "A Java reflection error has occured; it is likely that the library has been upgraded and changed in a way incompatible with this method." Is there a standard Java Exception I can throw that indicates just a general reflection error? Should I define my own? Or would it be best to just declare that this method can throw all of the possible reflection exceptions?
I am currently using JUnit 4.4 and Java 1.6.x. And after a recent code fix, we started getting this AssertionFailedError in my JUnit tests on the method: UtilityTest.testParseDate(4t): Mon Jan 15 09:26:07 PST 2001 expected: "Mon Jan 15 09:26:07 PST 2001" but was: "Mon Jan 15 09:26:07 PST 2001" junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: UtilityTest.testParseDate(4t): Mon Jan 15 09:26:07 PST 2001 expected: but was: at UtilityTest.testParseDate(Unknown Source) As you can see, the expected and actual appear identical, and after several code inspections, we can find no obvious error in the code. Test runs with actual data have also produced correct (expected) results. Has anyone seen this behavior before in JUnit, and if so, did you find the cause and/or a fix? I have seen the same thing in previous versions of Java and JUnit myself: always somewhat random when it occurs, and usually the only fix "that worked" was to retype the chunk of code in from scratch. Weird, yet that was tne only way to remove this error. I'm trying to find out something more "concrete" in the behavior this time. Thanks, -Richard
We're customizing an Eclipse RCP based tool for a client.

Since we don't see this problem on any other computer I'm at a loss as to what might be causing it. It must be a configuration problem on the machine in question, as the code is from the vendor (so presumably well tested) and works on every other machine we've tested it on. Does anyone have any suggestions about what might be behind the problem for that computer? Or suggestions about lines of investigation which might reveal the issue?
I'm making this a community wiki in order to better understand the semantic differences between these errors and their runtime or compiled consequences. Also, I've coded on Java far too long and I want to learn pointers better in C++ -- so I need other people to do it. Edit2: I am refactoring this question. The distinction I am trying to draw is that on managed code, these errors are all uniformly dealt with via an Exception. However, C++ is not so simple -- and I want to understand whether in each case you are likely to get an error, segfault, recoverable behavior, or worse a silent error that propagates. Please see my new concrete examples (and yes, I know that the answer is always "exactly as it is coded"; I'm a programmer after all. I want to know the interesting details of what you often run in to.) Edit3: In the following, by "class" I instead mean an instance of a class. Thanks Error 1: Pointer value is NULL, aka pointer == 0 Managed code: Throws NullPointerException at runtime C++: ? Example: Well, duh, you have a pointer to a class but it is initialized to 0. What happens when you send it off to a function. ie. C++ does not leave any indication of class; it is just a concatenation of public "placeholders". Error 2: Pointer points to an former class in memory whose value is NULL or == 0 Managed code: Not allowed through memory model. All referenced objects remain in memory. No exceptional cases? C++: ? Example: You had a pointer to a class and the class got deleted. You then pass the pointer as an argument to a function. Obviously, the problem that occurs depends on how the function deals with the pointed to class. My question is: Is there failsafe handling for this on STL? A good proprietary library? The average open source code? Error 3: Pointer points to an class that is not of the correct class or subclass Managed code: Throws ClassCastException. C++: [correct if wrong] Compiler tries to fight this by not allowing bad casts. However, if this is to occur at runtime, I presume undefined behavior. Are there cases of similar class objects where this would not always blow up? Example: Your pointer is reassigned incorrectly to have its value equal to a another class entirely. I assume that the function you pass this referenced class to will just blindly grab for the offset of any instance variables it references. Thus, it interprets the raw binary wrongly. There is no way to prevent this in C++? And/or... is there any case where this ability is exploited for good? Error 4: Pointer points into middle of class (misaligned) or uninitialized garbage Managed code: Not allowed by memory model. C++: Equivalent to case 3? Example: Frequently you actually do use this legally. For example you can access the array of an STL vector directly - this is pointing into the middle of a class. However, it seems just as easy to "miss"? Is there a common pitfall where you might have this happen against your will, like if a library is loaded that is different than the one you linked to (and is there a mechanism to prevent that?) Thanks in advance to all contributors.
I have a question about throwing exceptions in Java, a kind of misunderstanding from my side, as it seems, which I would like to clarify for myself. I have been reading that the two basic ways of handling exception code are: 1.) throwing an exception in a try-block with "throw new ...", and catching it immediately in a catch-block - the so called try-throw-catch mechanism. 2.) throwing an exception in a method with "throw new ..." and then declaring in the header of the method that this method might throw an exception with "throws ..." - the so called pass-the-buck. I have recently read that "it doesn't make any sense to throw an exception and then catch it in the same method", which made me think whether I understand the thing in the wrong way, or the person who had written this had something else in mind. Doesn't the first way of handling exceptions does exactly this (the try-throw-catch mechanism) ? I mean, it throws an exception and catches it in the same method. I have read that it is a better practice to throw an exception in one method, and catch it in another method, but this is just one (probably better) way. The other way is also legal and correct, isn't it? Would you, please, give me a comment on this ? Thank you very much.
I'm using spring and acegi in a webapp that's deployed in tomcat 5.5.26. I want to see if the user is logged in on the 404 page, so that we can show their name if they're logged in, and a login link otherwise. I have the HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter, in the filters on the REQUEST dispatcher. I also have it in the ERROR dispatcher. The code path appears that the request goes into my app, through the REQUEST dispatcher to the HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter which records that it has already been applied, sets up the user context then continues the filter chain, and then clears the user context. It then makes its way down the ERROR dispatcher, but the HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter doesn't do anything because it has already been run for this request, so when it gets to the 404 page, there is no authentication in the context (as it was cleared on the way out) and not put back in.
My co-workers and I are having a problem using Firefox 3.0.6 to access a Java 1.6.0___11 web application we're developing. Everything works fine anywhere from 1-30 minutes into the session...but eventually, the connection fails and the following error appears: Secure Connection Failed An error occurred during a connection to 10.x.x.x. Cannot communicate securely with peer: no common encryption algorithm(s). (Error code: ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap) IE works fine. Firefox throws the error in both Windows and Fedora, so the problem doesn't appear to be tied to an OS. The Java EE application runs on a Tomcat 6.0.16 server. All pages are encrypted using TLS 1.0 through an Apache 2.2.8 HTTP server with mod_nss. Our Apache server is configured to reject SSL 3.0 connections. One hypothesis we have is that Firefox might be trying to establish a SSL 3.0 connection...but why? Based some Googling, we tried the following things, but without success: using Firefox 2.x (some people reported instances where 2.x worked but 3.x didn't): enabling SSL2 disabling SSL3 disabling OCSP (Tool > Options > Advanced > Encryption > Validation) ensuring that the anti-virus/firewall of the client computer isn't blocking or scanning port 443 (https port) Any ideas?
I need to walk a JDOM tree and make changes as I go along; at this point, changes are mostly adding new elements right now but could also include reordering elements or removing elements. All work is done on the same thread so there are no concurrency issues. This turns out to be difficult because JDOM iterators can throw a ConcurrentModificationException if you try to add a node during traversal. From what I can see, JDOM uses lists instead of directly linking DOM nodes and this makes it difficult to do modifications on the fly. I've seen a couple of recommendations on how to deal with this, such as deferring the adds until after the traversal is done, or building a new tree on the fly so that the traversed tree remains unchanged. These won't work for me because I need a consistent view of the tree as I modify it. I'm beginning to suspect that JDOM just won't work here. Do any of the other Java DOM models make this easier? Or is there a way to do this in JDOM?
yes, this is a very noobish question. I'm a .NET developer and I need to step through some java code to see exactly what is going on so i can port some java into some c#. So far i've not needed to do that .. until now. So .. i have absolutely zero knowledge of java debugging. So can someone please explain in blond-speak how i can debug the following java program, and specifically ... this line/method in the following => code source zipped, found here. => line of code: \src\com\yahoo\platform\yui\compressor\JavaScriptCompressor.java :: line 550 ... buildSymbolTree(); Now, to add to my embarassment, I have no idea what program i need to download, what steps i need to do to add this java project, add a breakpoint, start debugger, etc. I would appreciate it if someone could provide some steps to doing this. Oh .. this will be all installed on a virtual pc running windows xp. The only thing this virtual pc has installed on it (currently) is windows xp & the java runtime (jre-6u12....) Thanks kindly! Steps (will update when more info comes in) Grab/install NetBeans Ide from here. (Program to debug java with). (how to open an existing project?) (how to make a break point?) (how to start debugging .. including defining the command line args to read in the file?) (how to make a watch item?) Wiki Mode Made this a wiki so other people can edit/update the steps.
For a number of years now I have been unable to get a decent answer to the following question: why are some developers so against checked exceptions? I have had numerous conversations, read things on blogs, read what Bruce Eckel had to say (the first person I saw speak out against them). I am currently writing some new code and paying very careful attention to how I deal with exceptions. I am trying to see the point of view of the "we don't like checked exceptions" crowd and I still cannot see it. Every conversation I have ends with the same question going unanswered... let me set it up: In general (from how Java was designed), Error is for things that should never be caught (VM has a peanut allergy and someone dropped a jar of peanuts on it) RuntimeException is for things that the programmer did wrong (programmer walked off the end of an array) Exception (except RuntimeException) is for things that are out of the programmer's control (disk fills up while writing to the file system, file handle limit for the process has been reached and you cannot open any more files) Throwable is simply the parent of all of the exception types. A common argument I hear is that if an exception happens then all the developer is going to do is exit the program. Another common argument I hear is that checked exceptions make it harder to refactor code. For the "all I am going to do is exit" argument I say that even if you are exiting you need to display a reasonable error message. If you are just punting on handling errors then your users won't be overly happy when the program exits without a clear indication of why. For the "it makes it hard to refactor" crowd, that indicates that the proper level of abstraction wasn't chosen. Rather than declare a method throws an IOException, the IOException should be transformed into an exception that is more suited for what is going on. I don't have an issue with wrapping Main with catch(Exception) (or in some cases catch(Throwable) to ensure that the program can exit gracefully - but I always catch the specific exceptions I need to. Doing that allows me to, at the very least, display an appropriate error message. The question that people never reply to is this: If you throw RuntimeException subclasses instead of Exception subclasses then how do you know what you are supposed to catch? If the answer is catch Exception then you are also dealing with programmer errors the same way as system exceptions. That seems wrong to me. If you catch Throwable then you are treating system exceptions and VM errors (and the like) the same way. That seems wrong to me. If the answer is that you catch only the exceptions you know are thrown then how do you know what ones are thrown? What happens when programmer X throws a new exception and forgot to catch it? That seems very dangerous to me. I would say that a program that displays a stack trace is wrong. Do people who don't like checked exceptions not feel that way? So, if you don't like checked exceptions can you explain why not AND answer the question that doesn't get answered please? Edit: I am not looking for advice on when to use either model, what I am looking for is why people extend from RuntimeException because they don't like extending from Exception and/or why they catch an exception and then rethrow a RuntimeException rather than add throws to their method. I want to understand the motivation for disliking checked exceptions.
I tried to do several searches before posting this question. If this is a duplicate, please let me know and I will delete it. My question revolves around the proper way to handle errors produced through our web application. We currently log everything through log4j. If an error happens, it just says "An error has occurred. The IT Department has been notified and will work to correct this as soon as possible" right on the screen. This tells the user nothing... but it also does not tell the developer anything either when we try to reproduce the error. We have to go to the error log folder and try finding this error. Let me also mention that the folder is full of logs from the past week. Each time there is an error, one log file is created for that user and email is sent to the IT staff assigned to work on errors. This email does not mention the log file name but it is a copy of the same error text written that is in the log file. So if Alicia has a problem at 7:15 with something, but there are 10 other errors that happen that same minute, I have to go through each log file trying to find hers. What I was proposing to my fellow co-workers is adding an Error Log table into the database. This would write a record to the table for each error, record who it is for, the error, what page it happened on, etc. The bonus of this would be that we can return the primary key value from the table (error_log_id) and show that on the page with a message like "Error Reference Id (1337) has been logged and the proper IT staff has been notified. Please keep this reference id handy for future use". When we get the email, it would tell us the id of the error for quick reference. Or if the user is persistent, they can contact us with the id and we can find the error rather quickly. How do you setup your error logging? By the way, our system uses Java Servlets that connect to a SQL Server database.
I am working with a DataInputStream and had a question about EOFExceptions. According to java docs: Signals that an end of file or end of stream has been reached unexpectedly during input. This exception is mainly used by data input streams to signal end of stream. Note that many other input operations return a special value on end of stream rather than throwing an exception. Does this mean that when a EOFException is generated, the stream will not NEVER open again? Does it mean you should NEVER expect any more data from it ever? If an outputstream is connected to an inputstream and outputstream.close() is called, will an inputstream receive the EOFException or an IOException? An IOException is described as: Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred. This class is the general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations. Does a close on the outputstream produce either a EOFException or an IOException on the datainputstream side?
(Forgive me because I do not write in Java very often.) I'm writing a client-side network application in Java and I'm having an interesting issue. Every call to readInt() throws an EOFException. The variable is of type DataInputStream (initialized as: DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(sock.getInputStream())); where sock is of type Socket). Now, sock.isInputShutdown() returns false and socket.isConnected() returns true. I'm assuming that this means that I have a valid connection to the other machine I'm connecting to. I've also performed other checks to ensure that I'm properly connected to the other machine. Is it possible that the DataInputStream was not set up correctly? Are there any preconditions that I have missed? Any help is greatly appreciated. @tofubeer: I actually wrote 17 bytes to the socket. The socket is connected to another machine and I'm waiting on input from that machine (I'm sorry if this was unclear). I successfully read from the stream (to initiate a handshake) first and this worked just fine. I'm checking now to see if my sent-requests are malformed, but I don't think they are. Also, I tried reading a single byte from the stream (via read()) and it returned -1.
I have an EJB3 application which consists of some EJB's for accessing a DB, and exposed via a Session Bean as a web service. Now there are two things I need to find out: 1) Is there any way I can stop SQL exceptions from causing the web service from throwing a SOAP Fault? The transactions are handled by the container, and currently sql exceptions cause a RollBackException to be thrown, and consequently the transaction to be rolled back (desired behaviour) and the web service to throw a fault (not desired). 2) I wish to extend the webservice to be able to take in a list of entities, and the session bean to persist each. However, I want each entity to be executed in its own transaction, so that if one fails the others are not affected (and again the web service should not fault). For (1) I have tried to catch the RollBackException, but I assume this is thrown somewhere on another thread, as the catch block is never reached. I assume for (2) I will need to look into User Transactions, but firstly would prefer the container to manage this, and secondly do not know how to force the use of user transactions. Thanks.
Here's the situation: I practiced creating a mini blog application. I used Strut's EventDispatchAction to handle all post related methods like updating and listing posts. I have an update() method (http://mywebsite/post?update) that updates the database and then if it's successful it forwards to the same action class but I used a different method to handle it, the list() method (http://mywebsite/post?list) which lists all the posts of the current user. The problem is it doesn't work and throws up a: javax.servlet.ServletException: The server side component of the HTTP Monitor has detected a java.lang.StackOverflowError. This happens when there is an infinite loop in the web module. Correct the cause of the infinite loop before running the web module again. Do you guys have any idea on how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated! EDIT: I solved it guys. I just need to put value in the parameter of my forward, in my case I have to do: post?list=list instead of just post?list (the normal way). The method is ignored I guess if it doesn't have a value. It's really weird why Struts is behaving like this. Maybe someone can shed some light on this?
I am using the getResponseBody() method of the org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.PostMethod class. However, I am always getting a message written to the console at runtime: WARNING: Going to buffer response body of large or unknown size. Using getResponseBodyAsStream instead is recommended. In the code I have to write the response to a byte array anyway, so it is the getResponseBody() method that I ought to use. But is there an easy way that I can suppress the warning message so I don't have to look at it at every run? If it was a compiler error, I'd use the @SuppressWarnings annotation, but this isn't a compile-time issue; it happens at runtime. Also, I could use getResponseBodyAsStream to write to a ByteArrayOutputStream, but this seems like a hacky way to get around the warning (extra lines of code to do what getResponseBody() is already doing for me). My guess is that the answer involves System.out or System.err manipulation, but is there a good way to do this?
I've been running up against a problem with Java Swing + my Wacom Graphire tablet for a few years in several Java applications and have now encountered it in my own. I use a pen tablet to get around wrist issues while clicking a mouse, and it works fine under Windows except when I'm using Java applications. In Java applications, the single-click of the pen doesn't work correctly. (Usually the problem only occurs with file-selection dialog boxes or tree controls.) The pen tablet also comes with a wireless mouse that works with the same tablet, and its single-click does work correctly. I don't know whether the problem is in the WACOM driver or in the Java Swing runtime for Windows or both. Has anyone encountered this before? I'd like to file a bug report with WACOM but I have no idea what to tell them. I have been able to reproduce this in my own application that has a JEditorPane with an HTML document that I've added a HyperlinkListener to. I get HyperlinkEvent.ACTIVATED events on every single click with the mouse, but I do NOT get HyperlinkEvent.ACTIVATED events on every single click with the pen. One big difference between a pen and a mouse is that when you click a button on a mouse, it's really easy to cause the button-click without mouse movement. On the pen tablet it is very hard to do this, and that seems to correlate with the lack of HyperlinkEvent.ACTIVATED events -- if I am very careful not to move the pen position when I tap the tablet, I think I can get ACTIVATED events. Any suggestions for things to try so I can give WACOM some good information on this bug? It's really frustrating to not be able to use my pen with Java apps, especially since the pen works fine with "regular" Windows (non-Java) applications. Normally I wouldn't ask this question here but I'd like to find out from a programmer's standpoint what might be going on so I can file a good bug report.
I'm using the official Sybase JDBC driver to connect to a database and call a stored procedure by creating a CallableStatement, binding the parameters to it and calling .execute() on it. However, I found that no exception is thrown, even if the stored procedure fails. I can verify that the failure is propagated back to me by sniffing the traffic to the database with Wireshark and observing the error messages coming back. Finally I found that using .executeUpdate() instead of .execute() does give me the exceptions, however I still have two questions left: Why are .execute() and .executeUpdate() behaving differently? From the SUN documentation of the interface it seems that they should do (almost) the same thing... Is it always appropriate to replace .execute() with .executeUpdate() when calling a stored procedure? Must the stored procedure conform to some particular requirements to be callable with .executeUpdate()? (for example, must it have an update/delete/insert statement as the last step?) Update: I've tried jTDS, and it behaves correctly (as in: it throws the SQLException in both cases - with .execute() and with .executeUpdate()). However, due to constraints beyond my control, switching out the driver is not really possible. Also: I'm no interested in the result returned by this stored procedure, it is an insert/update type procedure. I would only be inserted to see (and be able to catch / log) if it fails or not. An other thing I've tried is to get the warnings off the connection after .execute(), but it didn't contain anything either.
Background In my current project - a server product with no GUI front-end, I'm trying to write in better error handling support. Errors currently are outputted to the logs and are typically not read by users. We use PostgreSQL as our database backend and we access it using direct JDBC calls and DAOs via a database pooler. Most database related exceptions are wrapped in a generic DatabaseException class that implements RuntimeException and attempts to pull out debugging and state information from the exception it was passed. In our particular case, it will access the underlying PostgreSQL database driver - PSQLException. So far this approach has worked well for getting more verbose information about what caused the database error, with the notable exception described below. Furthermore, since we have very specific performance and legacy support requirements we have a lot of custom SQL magic that makes the following the stack trace back a bit more time intensive but not impossible or difficult. Problem Described I have noticed that when we get a SQLException as a result of a faulty SQL statement, the driver's implementation does not return the SQL statement that caused the error. After doing a little searching, I found out that there is a way to drop the PostgreSQL driver into a debug mode on startup and have it display properties about its internal query. However, it is undesirable for us to run the driver in debug mode in our production environment (and honestly I haven't been able to figure out how to get it into the freakin mode!). Question Has anyone else dealt with this same issue before and found a solution? If not, is there some OOP pattern out there for storing query information before execution and then assigning that information to the exception thrown? Or do most developers just feel that they don't need the full query to troubleshoot database issues? Honestly, I don't need it because I have the full stack trace and I can look up the invoking query, but it definitely speeds up my debugging by having it be the first thing that I see in the error logs.
By default, Tomcat sends some HTML content back to the client if it encounters something like an HTTP 404. I know that via web.xml an <error-page> can be configured to customize this content. However, I'd just like for Tomcat to not send anything in terms of response content (I'd still like the status code, of course). Is there any way to easily configure this? I'm trying to avoid A) explicitly sending empty content on the response stream from my Servlet, and B) configuring custom error pages for a whole bunch of HTTP error statuses in my web.xml. For some background, I'm developing an HTTP API and am controlling my own response content. So for an HTTP 500, for example, I'm populating some XML content on the response containing error information. For situations like an HTTP 404, the HTTP response status is sufficient for clients, and the content tomcat is sending is unnecessary. If there's a different approach, I'm open to hearing it. Edit: After continued investigation, I still can't find much in the way of a solution. If someone can definitively say this is not possible, or provide a resource with evidence that it will not work, I'll accept that as an answer and try and work around it.
I've google'd around a bit, and haven't really found a good answer for my question: What is the customary way to pass back error information to java from native jni code? I would normally just pick a design and go with it, but this code is called every 5 milliseconds, (approx), so I thought I'd ask if there's a customary 'clean / efficient' way to do this. The way I see it, I have four obvious options: On each call, in java create an "error return" object and pass it through to the JNI. If there's a problem, the native code fills in the error description in this object, and the java code checks it on return. Since errors are not the common case, this creates a lot of objects for the GC to clean up, and 99.99% of them are unnecessary. Similar to #1, create some single "error return" object in the java class which is passed to each method call over and over. Check it in the java code on each return for errors. This seems dodgy to me, but maybe it's the proper option? Create an object in the native code which contains a description of the error if applicable, and pass it back as a return value to java. After the call in java, check the return for null. This seems less wasteful than #1, but it seems a bit awkward. Simply build a integer return value on the jni method, and pass back an int corresponding to the "exit" value of the native code. Enumerate all possible native exit states in a java map. Compare the return value to '0', and look up the error in this map if necessary. This appears more efficient than the others, but seems more clumsy, since a change in native code would require someone to go back and update the "error table". I feel as though I'm missing something obvious... is there a guru out there that can offer any insight? Thanks!
We recently pushed a web application (tomcat 5.5.x web app) into production and it started exhibiting odd behavior today. We don't see this behavior in any development or pre-production environment. Our only view into the production system at runtime is logging. Although they can tell us what happened they can't really help us diagnose why it is happening. We have had to reload the context twice yesterday to resolve the issue. I was considering starting the production tomcat server with jpda active. This would allow me to connect a debugger to the application if the problem reoccurred (after removing tomcat from the pool of servers servicing user requests). You clearly pay a performance penalty with jpda when a debugger is connected. However, I was wondering what the "cost" was when a debugger wasn't connected? I suspect that the overhead associated with "listening" for a debugger might be pretty minimal. Before I spend a few hours on performance measurements I was hoping that someone could point me to documentation that might clarify this? java version "1.5.0_17" Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_17-b04) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.5.0_17-b04, mixed mode) on RHEL 5.3 Thanks!

I am trying to run an Java Applet application that ran fine on Windows XP (using Eclipse IDE) but after I imported the project on MacOS X (Using Eclipse on MacOS too), it fails to run displaying this error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Bad version number in .class file at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:675) at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:124) at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:260) at java.net.URLClassLoader.access$100(URLClassLoader.java:56) at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:195) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:188) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:316) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:280) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:251) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassInternal(ClassLoader.java:374) at edu.isi.calo.mapping.gui.DieselUtil.(DieselUtil.java:9) at edu.isi.diesel.DieselEditor.processSettingsFile(DieselEditor.java:597) at edu.isi.diesel.DieselEditor.main(DieselEditor.java:80) Has anybody faced such a problem?

In the j2ee applications I plan on standardizing the exception handling strategy. No more swallowing exceptions and basically converting all checked exceptions into unchecked (except for some that actually can be recovered from. The standard will be that all Exception will be thrown back up to the container (eg: http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/19/exceptions.html). Exceptions such as SQLException cannot be recovered from, and if it occurs deep within the data layer I am going to force it back upward. However, small sub-routines such as email notifications will be wrapped in a try catch to prevent an exception occurring from breaking the entire application flow. (EG: Why stop an entire process from completing because the user didn't get an email notification that they didn't need anyway!) Any advice on this? Again to reiterate I am basically re-throwing all exceptions back up to the container which has its own error page, which then logs it to log4j as well.
Hopefully an easy question here for someone..... I'm using RAD 7.5.2, and am writing Junit tests. I was writing them just fine with JUnit 3, and then I wanted to mock up some function calls. So I loaded up jmockit 0.9.7 and Junit 4.6. I also include -javaagent:jmockit.jar as a VM argument. When I "Run As Junit Test", it goes along with no problems at all (at least, none that I can see on the output). The output of Junit is good, and no errors are dumped to the console. When I "Debug as Junit Test", it won't work. It dumps me out into: InstrumentationImpl.class --> Source not found ...and when I hit continue.... NativeMethodAccessorImpl.class --> Source not found ...and when I hit continue... The JUnit ends after this. It dumps the following to the console: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:79) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:618) at sun.instrument.InstrumentationImpl.loadClassAndCallPremain(InstrumentationImpl.java:160) Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: sun/instrument/InstrumentationImpl.redefineClasses0([Ljava/lang/instrument/ClassDefinition;)V at sun.instrument.InstrumentationImpl.redefineClasses(InstrumentationImpl.java:98) at mockit.internal.RedefinitionEngine.redefineMethods(RedefinitionEngine.java:197) at mockit.internal.RedefinitionEngine.redefineMethods(RedefinitionEngine.java:184) at mockit.internal.RedefinitionEngine.redefineMethods(RedefinitionEngine.java:116) at mockit.internal.RedefinitionEngine.setUpInternalStartupMock(RedefinitionEngine.java:53) at mockit.internal.Startup.loadInternalStartupMocks(Startup.java:123) at mockit.internal.Startup.initialize(Startup.java:110) at mockit.internal.Startup.premain(Startup.java:97) ... 5 more Fatal error: processing of -javaagent failed I can run both JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 on my tests with no problem, it's when I use the -javaagent:jmockit.jar (with the debugger; by themselves they're fine) that things get ugly, and I have to do that to use the jmockit stuff. Thoughts?
have this method call -> simpleJdbcTemplate.queryForInt(sql,null); -> queryForInt() method in the springs SimpleJdbcTemplate throws a DataAccessException which is a runtime exception. i want to propegate exceptions to the view tier of the application since Spring frame work Wraps Checked Exceptions inside RuntimeExceptions i stuck here how do i do this? Explanation 1: The value-add provided by the Spring Framework's JDBC abstraction framework- they say The Spring Framework takes care of all except 3 and 6. 3 and 6 need to be coded by an application developer Define connection parameters Open the connection Specify the statement Prepare and execute the statement Set up the loop to iterate through the results (if any) Do the work for each iteration Process any exception Handle transactions Close the connection but if the exceptions not handled in the developer level if i encounter a situatoin like this: the connection to the database losses after certain time the program started. then a runtime exception will be thrown when a call to the above method made.since i dont handle the exception i cannot inform the user interface(view) how do i solve this?
I am getting an Out of Memory exception sometimes during or after the validation of component happens. I was trying to profile a large validation result <= 20000, and it worked, so I went bigger.

In my Java code, I occasionally run into situations where I have to catch a checked exception from a library function that I'm pretty sure can't occur in my use case. Also, when coding, I sometimes notice that I'm relying on certain inputs from other modules (my own) to have or not have particular features. For example, I might expect a string to be in a certain format etc. In these situations, I would often put in a verification step, although I control the code that send the input myself. At the moment, I'm working on a quite complex product that I want to be very reliable. Among other things, I want it to collect information from caught exceptions and automatically file bug reports. For the above two scenarios, I therefore defined an (unchecked) "ProbableBugException", that tells me I made a mistake in the code delivering the input data. Is that a) stupid, b) paranoid or c) good practice? This is going to be subjective, I'll put up three wiki answers so we can vote away without rep warping. ETA: Thanks to Svend for pointing out that Java has assertions, I didn't realize that. Assertions are actuall pretty much what my question was about, but I only knew them from C and have never used them there.
I'm trying to move a java application from an old server to a new server. The application runs on Tomcat, uses Microsoft SQL Server as the backend DB, and used a system DSN defined in Data Sources (ODBC) to decide where to connect to. The old server used Windows 2000/SQL server 2000, the new server uses Windows 2003/SQL Server 2005. The ODBC definition is identical between servers, and defines the DB to use. On the new server when a user tries to login the following appears in the stdout.log: user is being checked Error: java.sql.SQLException: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Invalid object name 'UserTable'. A table called UserTable does exist in the DB, but shows as "dbo.USerTable" through the management interface. Is there a setting somewhere in MSSQL I should be adjusting to make it happy with the "dbo." prefix being missing, or is there something else I've missed? [edit] Windows authentication is used, and the Public and Guest roles have been given full rights to the DB as a troubleshooting step.
I have a simple web service that uses an oracle database. When I test the service internally it works fine, however, calling the web service through my client (on the same machine but in a different WAR) throws an invocationtargetexception. I've finally discovered it's an issue with instantiating the OracleDriver. It doesn't throw any exception at all so I cannot find out what the error is. Googling has only provided a solution of using oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver instead of oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver but that doesn't seem to fix anything. The jar I'm using is ojdbc14.jar and, as far as I can tell, it's included in the class path for the web service properly... since it works when I test the service with a simple main method. EDIT: The InvocationTargetException is generated by an AxisFault from the Axis server. The invocationtargetexception is a wrapper class, and my attempts to try to extract the exception using .getCause() always return null. I am deploying the service using jboss and was including the driver JAR file in the library for the source but not for the server. Including the driver in /jboss/server/default/lib resolved it.
I used to get an error every couple days at a shop I worked at, one of the users called it "Beak" because she thought it reminded her of one: <. ...which, in the source, looks like: <P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><.</B> "Beak" can be readily reversed by bouncing JRun on the ColdFusion server, and that was enough for me when I had direct control over my server, and bouncing it took no time and impacted no one too severely. Now I'm in a shop where I don't have admin access to the webserver, and moreover (from a business perspective), the servers are transacting big dollar signs at any given moment, and can't just be bounced. My undying curiosity was perpetually thwarted by Google's inability to search for anything other than a random collection of B's and P's. But NOW... Now I have SO... and SO knows. I can't say it's CF, in fact, I suspect it's Java actually... or IIS... or the cosmos poking me with an annoying beak shaped stick... What the heck is Beak, and how do I make it go away? Edits for the confused... I can't say I can make the question much clearer, but I can say the lack of clarity was mostly a function of the error, and not my lack of inclusion. The error doesn't come from a piece of code... there is no specific line number... Looking through log files has never revealed a template or templates that are run before the problem occurs. Once triggered the error affects every template that is requested from the server, that effect is to return this string of letters, and nothing else, in response to the HTTP request: <P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><B><P><.</B> Restarting the JRun service causes the issue to go away... resetting the web server (IIS in all cases) or the database server (MSSQL, MySQL and Access) or the server itself (windows, various versions, various hardware) is unnecessary. I honestly didn't expect anyone who HASN'T SEEN THIS EXACT ERROR before to even respond. I appreciate that well meaning folks have tried, but this isn't a Web Developer Oversight error (in the traditional sense) and code snippets will probably not be required to identify or resolve it. I hope this clarifies my lack of information at least more to the degree to elucidate why I am asking for more information.
I am using ObjectOutputStream to create a file of serialized objects. I then use an ObjectInputStream to with the readObject() method to get the objects back out of the file. It works great the first time. Meaning that if the file does not exist and I open it then append any number of objects, I can open the ObjectInputStream object and access all the objects. However, if I subsequently open the same file (using the append option) and add more objects, the ObjectInputStream object gets a java.io.StreamCorruptedException: "invalid type code: AC" error where the new objects should start. Has anyone else run into this? I even went back to some basic textbook examples from the Deitel book and still get the same error. Edit: I found this - You may not append to the end of a serialized stream once it has been closed and reopened in append mode. The writes will appear to work, but when you go to read the file later you will get a java.io.StreamCorruptedException. at "http://mindprod.com/jgloss/gotchas.html#SERIALIZATION"
I have a Java program that is calling C code through JNI that I'm attempting to run on Linux. The external code consists of two .so files: one for the JNI bindings (built with swig) and the other with the actual functions. I have the two libraries in the same directory and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly. ldd reports no problems when running from the command line, but when I set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the same value in the "run configurations" dialog in the Eclipse editor and attempt to execute the program, it gets the following error: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: [path to libraries]/[JNI binding library].so: [actual code library].so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory This leads me to believe that the JNI wrapper library is loaded successfully, but there is a failure when that library attempts to load the library containing the actual code. Is there any way to debug this further? I will further note that this problem is happening in the eclipse editor itself and that I haven't attempted to package the code into a jar and run it within a free-standing jvm instance.
I would like to use Tomcat's error-page directive to display various different error pages in response to various types of exceptions. However, I want the error page displayed to have different styling and content depending on the original request URL that resulted in the error. Specifically, I have an admin part of my web application, and a user part. The error pages should be different, both in terms of styling and menus. The most reliable way to distinguish which part a given page is in is by looking for strings in the URL. I'd like to point the Tomcat error-page to, say, a servlet that would parse the URL and redirect to the appropriately styled error page. So 1) is it possible to use error-page, or some other mechanism, to redirect errors to a servlet rather than a JSP? (And if not, can I do what I'm imagining within a JSP?) and 2) once I'm in my servlet, can I determine the request URL that led to the error (request.requestURI doesn't appear to work -- it points to the location of the error JSP itself).

I'm trying to debug a problem in my Java application that throws no errors, no exceptions and doesn't even crash the app (it seems the failure happens in a separate thread). The problem seems to be inside a call to a library function (it's JAXBContext.newInstance(String) if that matters). The program will reach the line just before the call, but not the one just after it. My catch blocks are not entered and the program just continues to run. The problem happens while trying to render an XML response to a web request that came in via Struts. The request has been handled and the code should marshal the response object. The client gets a response right away (so the code doesn't seem to hang in a loop), but it's just empty. I have set a breakpoint just before the problematic line but the debugger just runs over it, I haven't a clue why. I'm using eclipse and the application runs inside an OSGi container (Apache Felix) that was started with -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=y. From within Eclipse I then use the Debug settings for "Remote Java application" to connect the debugger. What are techniques to get at such a problem?
I am getting OutOfMemoryException in a J2ME Application. How can I find what is causing this error? And how to prevent getting this error ? I make a http request. While the request isn't completed the screen shows a loading image (like a browser shows when a page is loading). This was done by creating an Image and repainting the screen. create image 1 -> repaint -> create image 2-> repaint-> create image 3 -> repaint -> create image 1-> repaint -> . I noticed (using wtk memory monitor) that this was consuming too much memory that wasn't garbage collected. Then I tried to create a class that is kind of pool of images. This class creates all the images and then show them. create image 1 -> create image 2-> create image 3 -> repaint -> repaint -> repaint -> repaint -> repaint -> . This second scenario doesn't seem to consume as much as memory than the first one. (using wtk memory monitor). However, I think (not sure if is this) those both approaches are contributing to cause this OutOfMemoryException.
Java has compiler checked exceptions. When I made transition to C++, I learned it doesn't feature checked exceptions. At first, I kept using exception handling, because it's a great feature. However, after a while I abandoned it, because I got into a situation every function might throw an exception. As only a small percentage of the functions I write can throw exceptions (say some 25% at the most), I found the overhead of doing exception handling for functions that cannot throw anything unacceptable. Because of this, I am really surprised that there are a lot of developers who prefer unchecked exceptions. Therefore, I am curious to know how they handle this problem. How do you avoid the overhead of doing unnecessary exception handling in case the language doesn't support checked exceptions? Remark: My question equally applies to C++ and C#, and probably to all other languages that don't feature compiler checked exception handling.
I'm completely stuck and need your help... I've created a webservice stub with jaxb 2.x for a service that sends a binary file (base64 encoded jpg images) within a soap message. Everything worked fine and I was able to receive and display the images, until I tried to export the eclipse RCP app to a product, which caused imediatly LinkageErrors (as usual, javax.xml.namespace.QName and some more). I was able to solve that problem to 'rebundle' axis2 and now everything works fine again - except the parsing of the binary file part within the stub, which now causes an exception (unexpected element). A closer look revealed, that the reader (OMStAXWrapper), that is used in the axis2-jaxb-generated Stub, now does not read the whole base64 text but only the first 10000 bytes. Then it doesn't find the correct ending of the element and throws an exception. As mentioned before - this didn't happen in the beginning, so I hope it's just a parameter or an option. Big thanks in advance for every help or hint! Edit It wasn't JAXB, I used JAXWS and wsimport to create the stub for the wsdl file...
I am given a task to convert a huge table to custom XML file. I will be using Java for this job. If I simply issue a "SELECT * FROM customer", it may return huge amount of data that eventually causing OOM. I wonder, is there a way i can process the record immediately once it become available, and remove the record from memory after that during sql retrieving process? --- edited on 13 Jul 2009 Let me elaborate my question. I have 1 db server and 1 application server. When I issue a select query in application, the data will travel from db server to app server. I believe (correct me if I am wrong) ResultSet will need to wait until receiving all records in the query. Even if we set fetch size as 4, for a 1000-record table, we still end up having 1000 records in heap memory of app server, is it correct? Fetch size only affect the number of round trip from/to db server. My question is, how to start processing on that 4 (or any number) records immediately after it's arrival to app server, and dispose it to free up memory in app server?
I am writing a java client for a web service. I used wsimport to generate the proxies. Copied them over to my workspace project (in eclipse). Wrote a simple program using couple of ws calls. Now when I want to step into a soap call, eclipse says that source code for the file was not found (com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.sei.SEIStub.class). It's using this class from rt.jar which is pointing to the src.zip that came with the installation. I noticed that src.zip does not contain the missing java files, so I downloaded them separately and tried adding them to zip file. I also tried copying them over to my project to see if I can trick eclipse into accepting them as the source file. I don't write/debug Java on a regular basis so please help me out here. I really want to debug and see what jax-ws is doing differently from axis as the call works in the later implementation.
Emacs and Java change propagation Hi, I'm mostly used to code in IDE like Eclipse but I wanted to try emacs. Because I keep hearing about how much better it is than big IDE like Eclipse and Visual Studio. So I was looking at what emacs provides for Java (with the JDEE extension) but it doesn't seem as complete as Eclipse. One of the most important thing I look for in a Java editor is change propagation and error notification. For example if I rename a class, I want to be able to have all the declarations of this class renamed automatically. And if I delete a method, I want to be able to see all the place where this creates errors. I didn't find those things in emacs, and this is a showstopper for me, I can't see how I could work on big projects without those features. So my question is : those features don't exist or is it just me that haven't looked at the right place?
What exactly happens when there is nothing on the queue and a take() is called. The API says the method will wait but does that mean the CPU spins checking for empty/not empty until an item is on the queue or does it mean that the thread yields and will be awoken by an interrupt? If it is the case of the former, I would probably want to see if the queue is empty and if it is call thread.yield() to give up processor time. My question is really do I need to call yield or does some inner mechanism handle that for me? Secondly, what is the interrupted exception meant for? If I understand correctly it means that if thread A is executing this method and is waiting for input and another thread B calls threadA.interrupt() then thread A will catch the interrupted exception and presumably pause execution, if it is nice. Is that the correct way of thinking about it?
We have an web application that uses Spring-Hibernate to persist registered users data in Oracle database. The application works fine in development environment, but when we copy it int live environment with much more data, it failed. Initially the application starts normally, but after few actions 'PermGen out of space' exception occured. I've started to search in Google, Spring and Hibernate forums, but it doesn't help. There is many discussions about this error, but for each solution, there are people, that say: 'It works' and other people say 'It doesn't'. For example, many people offer to increase -XX:MaxPermSize JVM parameter, other says that it doesn't works. There are posts that says that the problem in use of javassist library and others and cglib library needed to be used. Others says that the problem is in cglib. We use Java1.5_0_09, Spring 2.5 with javaassist3.4.GA, Tomcat 5.5 as web-container and Oracle 10g as database. Can anybody explain me what causes this problem and how to solve it?
At the company where I am right now, there are a lot of places in the code where an OurCompanyRuntimeException is thrown (where OurCompany is the actual name of the company). As far as I can tell, this exception is described as "A runtime exception thrown by code that we wrote here at this company." I'm somewhat new to Java, but I thought exception types were supposed to reflect what went wrong, not whose code threw the exception. For example, IllegalArgumentException means someone passed an illegal argument to something. You wouldn't have a SunIllegalArgumentException if an illegal argument was passed in code written by Sun, and then a IBMIllegalArgumentException -- that would be silly and pointless, right? And if you want to know where the exception was thrown, you look at the stack trace. I understand wanting to extend RuntimeException (so that you don't have as many try/catches or "throws"es all over) but why not make subclasses that explain what happened, as opposed to what company's code it happened in? Has anyone ever used the OurCompanyRuntimeException idea before, or have an idea of why they might have done it this way?
Possible Duplicate: The case against checked exceptions EDIT: It appears I didn't phrase my question correctly, and I can understand the frustration. I'm looking for some information that explains where I should use checked exceptions and where I should not use it. Most of the information on this subject is one sided - love/hate relationship. I think people make the assumption that one is bad over the other, or that developers always do a bad job about it. EDIT 2: Ok, I did some Google searching (I wish I had done that before posting here), and found some balanced answers. I'm including them so it may help anyone looking for an answer, not another debate (like the duplicate post mentioned above) http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05254.html It appears Rod has a balanced discussion on this topic in his book, J2EE design without EJB: http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=RodJohnsonInterview It also appears that if you use validation on domain object, it would not be a bad idea to use checked exceptions. Anyway, if you read the materials above, you could be convinced about not using checked exceptions or minimize the chances of using it. Rich, has provided an excellent link. Thanks, Rich! http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/19/exceptions.html Some more: http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/dev2arch/2006/11/effective-exceptions2.html http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/13.html
I was just wondering if I could display errors on a separate jsp fragment. I have a requirement where I have to display hyperlink errors (i.e clicking any error would focus to respective input field) For example, if I have a form and there are 20 fields, then I am suppose to use 20 times <t:message> tag. I know I can use single <t:messages> tag for all errors, but I have a requirement to focus individual field and I am not sure How we implement this using <t:messages>. However onclick event from <t:message> tag solves my issue but using 20 tags leave a big space under heading and page does not look nice. So I was thinking if I could put all the errors tag on separate jsf fragment and later do jsp include on the main page. I tried, but error messages are not being displayed. Does any body have any idea, how do I accomplish this?
Recently two of our clients have reported problems with our applets. Looking at the java plugin console it is full of ClassNotFoundException so none of our code is executed. I've been able to reproduce the stack trace using a virtual pc image with 0 free space on disk, but the problem goes away as I restore some disk space, and the users tell me that their disk is not full; they are able to create new files. Our applet requires java 6, and the problem has appeared with updates 1, 10 and 14 of the jre. We have also tried different browsers (IE and Firefox), clearing the browser and java caches, ... How can I debug or trace what is the jvm doing to load our applet? I suppose that the problem lies on some security directive on windows so I'm using Sysinternal's Process Monitor to log the activity but I don't really know where to look at.
We are running a vendor-supplied webapp in Tomcat 5.5 using the StandardManager for sessions (in memory). As sessions can get quite large (20M+), running out of heap space is a serious concern. Users want to keep sessions around for a couple of hours if possible but would rather evict sessions than run out of heap space. It does not appear that the vendor properly implemented Serializable in session'ed objects, so switching to the persistent session manager implementation isn't an option. Tomcat allows one to set a maxActiveSessions property that will restrict the overall number of sessions in the manager. However, when that limit is reached, no new sessions may be created until some existing sessions expire. We want to clobber the least recently used sessions first. Ideally, we would like to expire some not recently used sessions when heap usage approaches the "Xmx" setting even if they are not old enough to expire unconditionally. A very old Tomcat developer mailing list thread suggested that this might allow a denial of service attack*, but, as this application is only available within the corporate network, we are unconcerned. I thought about extending StandardManager to override processExpires() and clobber additional sessions if heap usage is greater than, say, 85% of max. However, this seems a bit problematic in practice. What if muuch of the heap is unreferenced, and the garbage collector would be able to collect a ton of objects (if it bothered to run) to reduce heap to 50% of max? I'd be expiring sessions unnecessarily. I guess we could mitigate this risk with some aggressive garbage collection settings. Also, how would I know how much memory I had saved by expiring a session? I would have to wait for a few GC cycles to know for sure. Perhaps I could take a conservative approach and remove at most N sessions per background process cycle until memory drops below an acceptable threshold. I could serialize the session as a way to estimate how much stuff would be GC'ed, but that relies on the vendor implementing Serializable and marking instance variables as transient appropriately. Has anyone solved this problem? As a short-term fix, we are increasing heap size, but that band-aid has its drawbacks as well. They were referring to a public site where sessions would be created pre-login. Someone could cause many new sessions to be created and crowd out the ones actually in use. Update: We really don't have much control over the system's architecture, and we specifically can't reduce session use. However, we can futz with the container as much as we'd like. Tomcat is the only open source servlet container that's vendor-supported, however.
I frequently showcase the jhat, jps, and jstack tool set to developers on Linux and Mac. However, a developer recently indicated that these are unusable in Windows if the Java app in question is running as a Windows Service. A Sun-filed bug says something very similar, but was closed due to inactivity. I have tested this out for myself, and indeed it appears true, though I can hardly believe it. Here is the setup: Tomcat or similar running as a Windows service with the "Log On As" == "Local System" A user with Admin privileges logged in to the same Windows machine. Admin opens Windows Task Manager, can see java.exe running Admin opens console, types "jps", gets back a list of processes that does not include Tomcat's java service process. As a brute force attempt, get the PID of tomcat as a service from Windows Task Manager. Type jstack < pid >. Get a reply: < pid > no such process This appears reproducible under Windows XP, Windows 2003 Server, and Windows 7. Java versions 1.5 and 1.6 yield the same outcome. Is there a way from the terminal, even though logged in as Admin, to "sudo up" to get JPS and the other tools to see the java service?
I am trying to run some java code using putty. I have all the jar files I need in a folder and when in the folder with the 'classname.class' folder I try to run the file but I get the following error.

I have an JSF/ICEFaces application that is works fine but I keep getting this error. Although the application continues normally, I still get that error now and then. As far as I understand it's complaining about having something in the file before XML header but I'm not sure why I'm getting this I'm using ICEfaces that generates XML back and forth for AJAX. Any ideas?

I'm working a web project that use: - Java - Jetty - Fitnesse tool - etc.. I have a difficulty to simulate/generate a SocketTimeoutException, more info below: The use-case-simplified: I wrote a API that make calls to a host(WebServer). In the source-code if I receive a RemoteException and is a SocketTimeoutException, I need to retry in some other host. All is working nice! How we test: Is a TDD project so we have a bunch of UT. And for a 'real' test we use the tool mentioned above. (Fitnesse) The 'problem': I have to simulate many problems that could occur in the Server. For that I wrote a simple servlet that simulate my WebServer. But for this use-case I need to simulate a SocketTimeoutException in my simulator. I was thinking in put a sleep in the simulator, but I think this could cause a client request timeout. If someone have any idea or a good tip will be very nice to know! Thanks in advance
In Java, I will occasionally throw an AssertionError directly, to assert that a particular line will not be reached. An example of this would be to assert that the default case in a switch statement cannot be reached (see this JavaSpecialists page for an example). I would like to use a similar mechanism in .Net. Is there an equivalent exception that I could use? Or is there another method that could be used with the same effect? Edit - To clarify, I'm looking for a mechanism to flag failures at runtime, in released code, to indicate that there has been a (possibly catastrophic) failure of some invariant in the code. The linked example generates a random integer between 0 and 2 (inclusive) and asserts that the generated number is always 0, 1 or 2. If this assertion doesn't hold, it would be better to stop execution completely rather than continue with some unknown corrupt state of the system.
I would like an automated web tests suite based on Selenium RC to take screenshots of pages when some errors are encountered. The test suite is a part of the continuous integration process and technically is executed by CruiseControl running as a Windows service. The selenium.captureScreenshot() method is called to trigger the actual screenshot. I've registered a JUnit RunListener to call it on any test failure. The problem is the screenshots are just blank files - PNG files totally black. The dimensions are 1440x900. When manually running the same tests from Eclipse the screenshots are OK (althought they are screenshots of the whole desktop not the browser window, but that's a different story and a minor issue). So I guess the cause of the problem is the Selenium being run as a Windows service. How can I have the screenshots of pages taken when exceptions in Selenium tests happen? The software used: Windows 2003 Server Selenium 1.0.1
We have a web application that uses a third party java applet for encryption and authentication. It's always been a bit finicky, but right now it has me pulling my hair out. Over the weekend, we migrated to a MS Load balanced cluster, upgraded our DNS, and rolled out all of the MS patches. Now the applet fails for all of our users who are using the MSJVM. The solution is simple, we just have them install a recent version of Sun, but I cannot figure out why the MSJVM is failing. Every other configuration works (Firefox, Safari, IE with Sun on Window, Linux or Mac) or I can get to work with a reasonable amount of effort, but nothing I can do will make MSJVM work. I understand the MSJVM is depreciated, but nothing on the site (http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/default.mspx) indicates that it should no longer work. I am looking for information that will either allow us to make the MSJVM work so we can determine if it's easier to fix or install Sun, or that I can use to force our desktop configuration team to update the company policy on the MSJVM. Thanks Update 2009.10.19: It's clear that something disabled the MSJVM. We should reject users who are using that JVM but it hasn't been a priority to update the site. We've just been waiting them to fail and then directing them to install SUN.
This problem is really befuddling me and hopefully someone could help me out. I've written some plugin libraries for a large java software. Everything works fine and well on my development computer. However, after I compiled and wrapped the software in Nullsoft Installer and install onto another computer, everything but the native dll plugins I developed runs, and I get a UnsatisfiedLinkError when I call System.loadLibrary. The installer works on my dev computer, the installed software runs fine even after I moved the original software. Here's what I do know: the native libraries are deved in .NET (C++/CLI) hooked in by JNI The software on the new computer is loading the right library path, can see the native dlls. In Java, I've added a segment to check the permissions on the files using File class, Java runs fine on library_dll.canRead() and library_dll.canWrite(), but hangs/crashes on library_dll.canExecute(). If anyone can help me, I would really appreciated it!!! Thank you all!
Hi everybody. The problem: elcipse-3.5.0 (Galileo) spits with an error when I try to launch it by clicking its launcher. The curse sound like this: A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) must be available in order to run Eclipse. No Java virtual machine was found after searching the following locations: /home/emanemos/bin/eclipses/eclipse-3.5.0/jre/bin/java java in your current PATH However, everything goes smoothly when eclipse is started from console. Before installing eclipse I've installed jdk1.6.0_16. I also created the $JAVA_HOME variable and changed my $PATH: $ echo $JAVA_HOME /usr/lib/java/jdk1.6.0_16 $ echo $PATH /home/emanemos/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/java/jdk1.6.0_16/jre/bin So that, my terminal got to know what java is: $ java -version java version "1.6.0_16" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_16-b01) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 14.2-b01, mixed mode, sharing) Then a folder eclipse was extracted from .tar.gz package under the directory ~/bin/eclipses. I changed the folder's name eclipse to eclipse-3.5.0 and changed $PATH again: $ echo $PATH /home/emanemos/bin/eclipses/eclipse-3.5.0:/home/emanemos/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/java/jdk1.6.0_16/jre/bin From this moment I was blessed to launch eclipse from console by the command eclipse. However, I feel desperate about using the eclipse's application launcher. Thanks in advance. I would be grateful for any help.
I have an environment where 2 load-balanced clustered tomcats pointing to same application. When they run under sticky session and not shared session, they works fine. Now I am implementing failover for tomcat. ie If one one fails other handles the sessions that handled by the failed one. And I am trying in-memory session replication. When I enable this feature, I am getting some exceptions like org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaManager requestCompleted SEVERE: Unable to serialize delta request for sessionid [68930629D2318EFAC06F3D75FFA162D0.tomcat2] java.io.NotSerializableException: org.json.JSONObject at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObject0(ObjectOutputStream.java:1156) at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.defaultWriteFields(ObjectOutputStream.java:1509) at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeSerialData(ObjectOutputStream.java:1474) at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeOrdinaryObject(ObjectOutputStream.java:1392) at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObject0(ObjectOutputStream.java:1150) at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObject(ObjectOutputStream.java:326) at org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaRequest$AttributeInfo.writeExternal(DeltaRequest.java:374) at org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaRequest.writeExternal(DeltaRequest.java:272) at org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaRequest.serialize(DeltaRequest.java:287) at org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaManager.serializeDeltaRequest(DeltaManager.java:640) at org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaManager.requestCompleted(DeltaManager.java:1120) at org.apache.catalina.ha.tcp.ReplicationValve.send(ReplicationValve.java:550) at org.apache.catalina.ha.tcp.ReplicationValve.sendMessage(ReplicationValve.java:537) at org.apache.catalina.ha.tcp.ReplicationValve.sendSessionReplicationMessage(ReplicationValve.java:519) at org.apache.catalina.ha.tcp.ReplicationValve.sendReplicationMessage(ReplicationValve.java:430) at org.apache.catalina.ha.tcp.ReplicationValve.invoke(ReplicationValve.java:363) at org.apache.catalina.ha.session.JvmRouteBinderValve.invoke(JvmRouteBinderValve.java:210) at org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:293) at org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler.invoke(JkCoyoteHandler.java:190) at org.apache.jk.common.HandlerRequest.invoke(HandlerRequest.java:291) at org.apache.jk.common.ChannelSocket.invoke(ChannelSocket.java:769) at org.apache.jk.common.ChannelSocket.processConnection(ChannelSocket.java:698) at org.apache.jk.common.ChannelSocket$SocketConnection.runIt(ChannelSocket.java:891) at org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.ThreadPool$ControlRunnable.run(ThreadPool.java:690) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619) Sep 11, 2009 7:21:06 PM org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaManager requestCompleted SEVERE: Unable to serialize delta request for sessionid [68930629D2318EFAC06F3D75FFA162D0.tomcat2] java.io.NotSerializableException: org.json.JSONObject Since JSON is not serialized I am putting it inside an ArrayList before setting it in session.

I am using the Executor framework to kick off several threads using a threadpool i.e newFixedThreadPool. I use threadpool.submit(aThread) to submit jobs to be executed by the threadpool and this works fine however I need to determine when all the threads are complete so that I can continue with other processing. I looked at using Future.get() which blocks until the thread is complete the problem here being that it blocks until a result is available. I also looked at using continuously calling the isTerminated() method followed by a sleep after issuing the shutdown to check if all threads are complete but this doesn't seem neat to me. Is there another cleaner way to this? Also if there is an exception raised in any one of the threads I want to be able to terminate all other running threads and also stop any queued up thread in the pool from starting. What is the best mechanism to do this? Look forward to hearing your replies TIA
I'm looking for a fail-safe way to round-trip between a JVM class file and a text representation and back again. One strict requirement is that the resulting round-tripped JVM class file is exactly functionally equivalent to the original JVM class file as long as the text representation is left unchanged. Furthermore, the text representation must be human-readable and editable. It should be possible to make small changes to the the text representation (such as changing a text string or a class name, etc.) which are reflected in the resulting class file representation. The simplest solution would be to use a Java decompiler such as JAD to generate the text representation, which in this case would simply be the re-created Java source code. And then use javac to generate the byte-code. However, given the state of the free Java decompilers this approach does not work under all circumstances. It is rather easy to create obfuscated byte-code that does not survive a full round-trip class-file/java-source/class-file (in part because there simply isn't a 1:1 mapping between JVM byte-code and Java source code). Is there a fail-safe way to achieve JVM class-file/text-representation/class-file round-tripping given the requirements above? Update: Before answering - save time and effort by reading all the requirements above, and note specifically: "Text-representation of JVM bytecode" does not necessarily mean "Java source-code".
I am coding this Sudoku Solver with the following algorithm: Given a grid which is assumed to be a valid sudoku puzzle and exists at least 1 solution, it'll find the first solution and return it. The puzzle is stored in a 2D array representing 9x9 slots. If a solution does not exist, it returns a puzzle where puzzle[0][0] = 0, else all slots in the puzzle is supposedly filled up with values (1-9). The algorithm is a bruteforce recursive method: It searches the puzzle row by row for a single slot. The method possibleValuesInGrid() returns the possible values that can fit into the slot based on the current puzzle and its existing values. If there are no possible values to be placed in the slot, it returns a False (puzzle[0][0] = 0) ELSE, it pops one of the values from the LinkedList of possible values and insert into the slot, and recursively call the same method again till all the slots are filled up. The code is being hosted at pastebin so I don't flood this page. I suspect there might be a logic error somewhere although its a bruteforce method, or even a bug that I can't seem to figure. I have hardcoded some system printlines to read through to figure for logic error, however I couldn't figure out where. Also, how it stopped at [8][4] is also curious. utils/PuzzleSolverBruteForce.java utils/PuzzleGenerator.java (not completed, but the dependency part for BruteForce class is done in here, and completed) runtime printlines for logic debugging.
I would like to be able to parse XML that isn't necessarily well-formed. I'd be looking for a fuzzy rather than a strict parser, able to recover from badly nested tags, for example. I could write my own but it's worth asking here first. Update: What I'm trying to do is extract links and other info from HTML. In the case of well-formed XML I can use the Scala XML API. In the case of ill-formed XML, it would be nice to somehow convert it into correct XML (somehow) and deal with it the same way, otherwise I'd have to have two completely different sets of functions for dealing with documents. Obviously because the input is not well-formed and I'm trying to create a well-formed tree, there would have to be some heuristic involved (such as when you see <parent><child></parent> you would close the <child> first and when you then see a <child> you ignore it). But of course this isn't a proper grammar and so there's no correct way of doing it.
I was reading some things about exception handling in Java, to be able to write better code. OK, I admit, I am guilty; I've used too much try-catch{} blocks, I've used ex.printStackTrace() in the catch, not even using a proper logger (actually the System.out and System.err were redirected to a PrintWriter, so a log was generated). However, after a few hours of readings, I find myself in a strange place: the unknown. If the exceptions are designed to pass info about abnormal states of flow, how does one know WHERE is the proper level to do something with that info? For instance, when a database error occurs, should one return a null value or an error code, or throw the exception? If thrown, WHERE should that exception be handled? I understand that is no use even to log an exception if you cant do anything about it. However, in GUI apps, that could easily kill your GUI (I am using SWT and I've seen this too often), even for the case of the menuShown() method (an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception will close the app, if not handled). The example could go on forever, but here's the summary of questions: Does using try-catch() excessively have a negative impact on performance? Is it better to use specific exception types? What if I missed catching one of the possible X types of exceptions that could occur? Frankly, I've heard of and use a mere 10% I think of the Java standard exceptions, in 2-3 years. Yes, someone said that if the caller don't know how to deal with the thrown exceptions, he SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT to call the throwing method. Is that right? I've read this article of Anders Hejlsberg, saying that checked exceptions are bad. Should that indicate that convenient exception swallowing is advised in some cases? A picture is worth 1000 words; I guess some examples will help a lot here. I know the subject is eternal, but actually I am looking forward to review a middle-size project of 150 classes, using your advice. Many thanks.
I am trying to set up a development environment to test Spring Portlet MVC for development of JSR 168 conforming portlets. I have the latest STS installed, which included Spring 2.5 and Eclipse (Catalina). This has been my environment to develop with Spring MVC, and that works fine using Apache as a local server for debugging. I found some instructions on the Pluto portal site on using Pluto as a remote debugging host for portlets. I have implemented those instructions. I am sending Eclipse into debug mode by right clicking on one of the JSPs and going into "debug as". My problem is that when I log into Pluto, it is not sending me into debug mode. I am seeing the default Pluto page as opposed to my portlet. My portlet has not been installed onto Pluto, and the instructions do not seem to require the portlet to be installed. To help, I have a screen shot at http://www.ceruleaninc.ca/pluto_problem.jpg, showing the following: Eclipse showing the remote debugging to localhost:8000 Tomcat showing the "Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 8000 The Catalina.bat jpda start command The Pluto Portal screen after log in Thanks much! I would welcome any advice on approaches to debugging portlets. I am not tied to pluto. There does seem to be a lack of detailed instructions on this topic.
My app makes an outbound connection to a server using a specific source port (in anticipation of firewall problems - a hardened system will probably require ports to be specified ahead of time). My problem is that my app makes the connection initially. However, if the connection ever breaks it will try again but the socket will get a BindException saying "address in use". This is not the case, as shown by netstat -pant. It shows that the the source port / remote socket pair does not exist (i.e., I'm not even seeing it in a WAIT mode, the connection just doesn't exist). I will try to connect forever without any success. I would think if it were a problem with the previous connection lingering, it would eventually timeout, but it doesn't. I get the bind exception forever. In my case, I was connecting to 10.0.1.229:4001 FROM 10.0.1.20:4002. So I was using netstat to look for the source socket (10.0.1.20:4002) or the remote socket (10.0.1.229:4001), but neither was found after the initial connection was broken, indicating that the address should NOT be in use. Is there something that would cause this connection to remain around even though netstat doesn't report it? Please note I'm on linux and also I realize that using a random source port would work around my issue, but not fix it. Please let me know. Thanks, jbu
After a break from coding in general, my way of thinking logically faded (as if it was there to begin with...). I'm no master programmer. Intermediate at best. I decided to see if i can write an algorithm to print out the fibonacci sequence in Java. I got really frustrated because it was something so simple, and used the debugger to see what was going on with my variables. solved it in less than a minute with the help of the debugger. Is this cheating? When I read code either from a book or someone else's, I now find that it takes me a little more time to understand. If the alghorithm is complex (to me) i end up writing notes as to whats going on in the loop. A primitive debugger if you will. When you other programmers read code, do you also need to write things down as to whats the code doing? Or are you a genius and and just retain it?
I have a fairly sophisticated server-side application which frequently requires me to see what is going on with its internals to debug and fix problems. I've therefore embedded a Beanshell instance, which I can telnet into (normally over a ssh tunnel), but I'm wondering if there is a better way. A few limitations: No readline support, which I can get around by using 'rlwrap' on telnet, but its not ideal Tab-completion of variables and methods would be really nice, but I haven't found a way to do this Pre-defining variables (to access stuff I need to access frequently) doesn't seem to work, I have to pre-define functions instead All-in-all its rather clunky, although Beanshell has the nice advantage that its a super-set of Java, so nobody needs to learn another programming language to use it. I'm wondering if others have any experience with facilitating remote debugging/administration via a scripting language (Beanshell or otherwise), perhaps someone has found a better approach.
I have an instance of Tomcat which periodically crashes for unknown reasons. There are no errors left in the logs, only a line in Event Viewer saying "Tomcat terminated unexpectedly". In a test environment I have been unable to replicate the issue. I am therefore mostly restricted to passive monitoring of the production environment. The problem does not seem to be related to memory as the unexpected terminations show no obvious correlation to the process' memory usage. What steps could I take to further diagnose this problem? EDIT: Some corrections/clarifications: It is actually not a single "instance" of Tomcat, rather several instances with similar configurations. OS is Windows 2003. Java version is Java 6. UPDATE: Looks like the issue might be related to memory after all. Discovered some crash dumps which were created in the Tomcat directory (not .../Tomcat/logs). The dumps mostly contained errors such as: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: requested 32756 bytes for ChunkPool::allocate. Out of swap space? This is unexpected as the process sometimes crashed when it's memory usage was a relatively low point (compared to historical usage). In all dumps, perm gen space is at 99% usage, but in absolute terms this usage is not consistent, and is nowhere near the limit specified in -XX:MaxPermSize.
I've a class class_A dealing with another class class_B which has methods with calls to other objects dealing with HTTP and JSON. Now I don't wanna handle these exceptions within class_B but rather on a higher level and thus forward them via throw e to class_A. Now I'm wondering when in my class A surrounding the call to a method of class_B with try/catch how I can get all the possible Exceptions that could get forwarded from that method or methods of subclasses (like HTTP & JSON). Preferred would be way to get the possible Exceptions directly in Eclipse, but other solutions are appreciated as well. (Please let me know if my problem description is not clear.) Update: What I'm looking for is not an actual implementation, but rather a list of potential exceptions, so I can see and decided for what cases I should better build a specific catch block and which Exceptions can be handled by a generic catch block.
Ok, I am very confused. Yesterday it worked just fine. Today suddenly I start getting an error. The main frame opens just fine and the first few buttons work. Just the last three suddenly do not work. I get the following error when I try to click those buttons (which should open new windows) Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: my/freelancebillingapp/paidStatusUI at my.freelancebillingapp.FreelanceBillingUI.paidClicked(FreelanceBillingUI.java:251) at my.freelancebillingapp.FreelanceBillingUI.access$200(FreelanceBillingUI.java:18) at my.freelancebillingapp.FreelanceBillingUI$3.mouseClicked(FreelanceBillingUI.java:89) at java.awt.AWTEventMulticaster.mouseClicked(AWTEventMulticaster.java:253) at java.awt.Component.processMouseEvent(Component.java:6266) at javax.swing.JComponent.processMouseEvent(JComponent.java:3267) at java.awt.Component.processEvent(Component.java:6028) at java.awt.Container.processEvent(Container.java:2041) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Component.java:4630) at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Container.java:2099) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Component.java:4460) at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.retargetMouseEvent(Container.java:4574) at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.processMouseEvent(Container.java:4247) at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.dispatchEvent(Container.java:4168) at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Container.java:2085) at java.awt.Window.dispatchEventImpl(Window.java:2475) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Component.java:4460) at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(EventQueue.java:599) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(EventDispatchThread.java:269) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(EventDispatchThread.java:184) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(EventDispatchThread.java:174) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:169) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:161) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:122) Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: my.freelancebillingapp.paidStatusUI at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:200) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:188) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:307) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:252) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassInternal(ClassLoader.java:320) ... 24 more Nothing has changed in the code from yesterday when it was working fine.

I've got a large set of Fitnesse (For Java - v20090513) tests which are executed against a SLIM Query table. To help with the testing (explain why we're getting certain results) I've added a new column to the end of the table. The idea is that the cells for that column would be empty (||) as they're not required to be tested against, it's just for informational purposes. The problem with this is that Fitnesse causes every one of those cells to fail because the returned data is different to the data entered (which was nothing). Is there a way to make Fitnesse ignore this column, or just make it pass? Ideally I don't want to change much of the fixture code which is being called. I understand I could use a table of type table and just match things up myself, but that's an hour or 2 of work which I can't really afford to do. Thanks for your help.

I've looked through many of the existing threads about this error, but still no luck. I'm not even trying to package a jar or use any third-party packaging tools. I'm simply running from within Eclipse (works great) and then trying to run the exact same app from the command line, in the same location it's built to (getting this error). My goal is to be able to zip up the bin folder and send it off to be run by someone else via a command line script. Some details: It's a command-line app and I'm using the commons-lang-2.4.jar for string utilities. That is the file that cannot be located (specificaly "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/lang/StringEscapeUtils") I have that jar in my lib folder and have added it to my build path in Eclipse via right-click "Build Path -> Add to Build Path" The .classpath file looks correct and contains the reference to the jar, but I assume that file is only used by Eclipse (contains this line: <classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/commons-lang-2.4.jar"/>) Could this be related to the Eclipse working directory setting? I have some internal template files that I created that are under src/templates, and the only way I can seem to get those to be seen is by setting the project working directory to AppName/src. Maybe I should be putting those somewhere else? Let me know if any additional info would help. Surely this is something simple, but I've wasted too much time on it at this point. This is reminding me why I originally left Java back in '05 or so...
I'm using Hibernate Validator in an application with EJB and Spring MVC. I'm using JBoss 5, Hibernate 3 and Spring MVC version 3. I'd like to try and catch validation exceptions at Spring Exception Resolver level and generate an error message based on the InvalidStateException message. I don't want to put exception handling logic in the data access layer; I want this to be driven by annotations and just handle the validation errors in one centralized place. The domain model is being correctly verified and an exception of type InvalidStateException is thrown as expected when I try to create an invalid entity (e.g. violate a length constraint on a field). At the point of trying to catch the exception in my instance of a Spring Exception resolver, I find my original exception has disappeared and a javax.ejb.EJBTransactionRolledbackException has taken its place. The original exception is not in the caused by list. My first guess was that org.hibernate.validator.InvalidStateException wasn't annotated with ApplicationException, so I installed a Hibernate event listener, caught the original exception and rethrew it as a new exception annotated with ApplicationException. This has no effect. One further complexity is that the web tier is calling EJBs via a Remote interface. I annotated my exception class with WebFault, but to no avail. What should I do to ensure the exception bubbles all the way up?
I'm trying to use ceilingKey(), ceilingEntry(), firstKey() and firstEntry() of the TreeMap class but getting error: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: method java.util.TreeMap.firstEntry with signature ()Ljava.util.Map$Entry; was not found. This error is caused by following code: if (tmpmap.size() == 1 && tmpmap.firstKey() == req_sbyte && tmpmap.firstEntry().getValue() == req_size) { send("F" + req_nr + "," + Integer.toString(req_filenr) + "," + Long.toString(req_sbyte) + "," + Integer.toString(req_size), "localhost", CLIENTPORT); } This is the output of java -version: java version "1.5.0" gij (GNU libgcj) version 4.1.2 20070925 (Red Hat 4.1.2-33) Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc. This is free software; see the source for copying conditions. There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Any explanations why is this happening and how to fix it? I checked libgcj's documentation, and it says there is such method firstEntry() and it returns Entry object which has getValue() method. So I do not clearly understand what is the problem with my code.
My application is mostly Java but, for certain calculations, uses a C++ library. Our environment is Java 1.6 running on RedHat 3 (soon to be RedHat 5). My problem is that the C++ library is not thread-safe. To work around this, we run multiple, single-threaded "worker" processes and give them work to do from a central Work Manager, also written in C++. Our Java application calls the C++ Work Manager via a third-party product. For various reasons, we want to re-write the C++ Work Manager and workers. I'm in favour of writing them all in Java, using JNI in each worker to call the C++ library. The main problem is what happens if the C++ library core dumps. Unfortunately, this is quite common, and we need to be able to see which line in our C++ library caused the problem, e.g. by examining a backtrace in something like GDB. My colleagues believe that it will be impossible to analyse the core dumps, because tools like GDB don't understand core files produced by Java. I hope that they're wrong, but I need to be sure before pushing my ideas further. What is the best way to analyse a core dump produced from Java/JNI?
While testing our setup for user acceptance testing, we got some reports that java applets in our web application would occasionally fail to load. The envt where it was reported was WinXP/IE6, and there were no errors found in the java console. Obviously we'd like to avoid it. What sort of things should we be checking for here? On our local servers, everything seems fine. There's some turnaround time when sending questions to the on-site guy, so I'd look to cover as many possible causes as possible. Some more info: We have multiple applets, in the instance that they fail loading, all of them fail loading. The applet jar files vary in size from 2MB to 8MB. I'm told it seems more likely to happen if the applet isn't cached yet, i.e. if they've been able to load the applets once on a given machine, further runs on that machine go smoothly. I'm wondering if there's some sort of network transfer error when downloading the applets, but I don't know how to verify that. Any advise is welcome!
I have a problem in JDBC driver for SQLite. I am executing a query with SELECT statement. If I get an empty ResultSet (0 rows) then I see a "Closed ResultSet" exception thrown when calling getString(1). Without much prior JDBC experience, my theory (which I could not confirm via JavaDocs for ResultSet) is that getString(1) does NOT work on an empty (zero-row) resultset (by design or due to a bug) ResultSet's "open" flag is set to false on zero rows (again, by design or a bug) I saw this bug report but am not sure if it's related. My qeustions are: Is the theory above correct? Is it a bug? Feature? (and if so, can someone point to documentation please?) Is it specific to SQLIte's JDBC or to generic ResultSet in all JDBC drivers? What is the correct way of doing stuff like that?? For #4, my solution was to use isFirst() call right after executeQuery() to check whether any rows are there in result set. Is this the best practice approach? (I could also have simply selected a count insetad since I didn't really need a result set, merely zero-nonzero flag, but I want to know the correct thingh to do if I did care about select's results) Thanks!

I have an Initializer class that implements the ServletContextListener interface. In its contextInitialized() method, I initialize some global classes that have to be destroyed, otherwise the servlet cannot be unloaded. However, when the servlet's init() method throws a ServletException, the contextDestroyed() method never gets called --> resources are not release --> servlet does not get unloaded by Tomcat (it remains in "running" state even though its init method never finished). My question is this - how do I cleanup the resources in this case? Bonus: why does the servlet even get to "running" state? I understand from the documentation that it's not supposed to be running unless the init() method finishes successfully. Edit - I think this is because each status line displayed in Tomcat Manager represents an entire war, and not a servlet. A war may contain several servlets, with some succeeding to start and others not. The Initializer is called when the container starts, and its destroy is called only when the entire container is dropped. This leads to a related question - is there a similar built-in way to monitor the state of individual servlets? (I'm aware I can write custom code to monitor the servlet, either via JMX, or not, but that's out of the scope of this question).
When I execute the batch file directly in DOS, everything runs as expected. But when I execute the batch file from Java runTime, it will run only the commands that invoke jar files (ie. invoke the JVM). It does not run any native dos commands. One problem is that I have no console to know why this is happening. I'm wondering if it's a permissions problem, but I have no idea. Anyone out there see this before? The Java code used looks something like this: Runtime.getRuntime().exec("c:\targetFolder\myBatch.bat"); // (Edited here for simplicity.) The batch file looks something like this (noting that I've simplified it): myBatch.bat: call java myJar.jar blah blah --- yes copy outputFile.out outputFile.bak --- NO mkdir testDir --- NO call java myJar.jar blah blah --- yes call someOther.bat --- NO The ---yes lines run fine and I see the expected results The ---no lines do not run, but I have no idea why not b/c there is no console to tell me. Thanks for any help!! Mike
I've created a simple plugin project in eclipse 3.5 that just stores third-party libraries for the use by other bundles in an eclipse RCP application. Worked as expected: I edited the manifest, exported the required packages and added the libraries to the build path (project build path as well as manifest build path). Some days later I added another jar to that project, did the same steps (exporting a package, adding the library to the build path(s)) but this time I can't import classes from that exported package in other bundles. The package was clearly selectable on the manifest editor but import statements in classes just taunt me with curly red lines. Importing classes from other packages exported by the bundles still works, only classes from the newly added lib remain invisible. Has anyone has an idea what I might have missed? I'm pretty stuck and have no idea how to convince google to show me the solution to that ugly issue...
I have two threads. One of them writes to PipedOutputStream, another one reads from corresponding PipedInputStream. Background is that one thread is downloading some data from remote server and multiplexes it to several other threads through piped streams. The problem is that sometimes (especially when downloading large (>50Mb) files) I get java.io.IOException: Pipe broken when trying to read from PipedInputStream. Javadoc says that A pipe is said to be broken if a thread that was providing data bytes to the connected piped output stream is no longer alive. It is true, my writing thread really dies after writing all his data to PipedOutputStream. Any solutions? How can I prevent PipedInputStream from throwing this exception? I want to be able to read all data that was written to PipedOutputStream even if writing thread finished his work. (If anybody knows how to keep writing thread alive until all data will be read, this solution is also acceptable).
I have an RMI client/server set-up on two machines that works fine in a simple situation when the server doesn't require a client-side defned class. However, when I need to use a class defined on the client side I am unable to have the server unmarshall those classes. I suspect this is an issue with my java.rmi.server.codebase property that I pass in as argument to the client app. I followed Sun's RMI Tutorial trail and I think I have followed the steps exactly except that I don't specify a classpath argument when executing client and server because they execute in the directory right above the root package directory (however I tried that too with no effect). The exceptions I get when attempting to execute the different client-side combinations described in detail below are all the same: RmiServer exception: java.rmi.ServerException: RemoteException occurred in server thread; nested exception is: java.rmi.UnmarshalException: error unmarshalling arguments; nested exception is: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: test.MyTask at sun.rmi.server.UnicastServerRef.dispatch(UnicastServerRef.java:353) at sun.rmi.transport.Transport$1.run(Transport.java:177) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at sun.rmi.transport.Transport.serviceCall(Transport.java:173) at sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransport.handleMessages(TCPTransport.java:553) at sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransport$ConnectionHandler.run0(TCPTransport.java:808) at sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransport$ConnectionHandler.run(TCPTransport.java:667) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1110) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:603) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:636) at sun.rmi.transport.StreamRemoteCall.exceptionReceivedFromServer(StreamRemoteCall.java:255) at sun.rmi.transport.StreamRemoteCall.executeCall(StreamRemoteCall.java:233) at sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef.invoke(UnicastRef.java:142) at java.rmi.server.RemoteObjectInvocationHandler.invokeRemoteMethod(RemoteObjectInvocationHandler.java:178) at java.rmi.server.RemoteObjectInvocationHandler.invoke(RemoteObjectInvocationHandler.java:132) at $Proxy0.execute(Unknown Source) at test.myClient.main(myClient.java:32) The details are: My client/server rmi is set up over a home network behind a router.

Other notes: 1 my server and client policy files correctly specify the path, as I've tested this setup with good and bad paths, and getting a security exception for bad path 2 this setup works if I don't use client-side defined objects, the client connects correctly to the server and the server executes. 3 when I place the client-side class on the server in the server's classpath, all executes fine. All help is appreciated.
Using the JUnit ant task to run my Unit Tests from CruiseControl on Centos 5.4 My jUnit Task forks to run the tests, the majority of which work ok, however I keep getting intermittent failures where the JVM crashes, always with the same error: [junit] Fatal: Stack size too small. Use 'ulimit -s' to increase default stack size. I've doubled the stack size using ulimit and the crashes continue to happen. The JUnit task runs about 100 different jUnit test classes and the JVM crash can happen in any of them, so I don't believe that the behaviour is due to any particular test. ulimit -a tells me that the stack size is 32768 kb ( I've upped it a few times to get it to this point ), which seems huge to me. Running the sun jdk 1.3 Anyone got any clues, or recommendations about what a sensible stack size might be. There has never been any mention of increasing the java stack size ( -Xss ) - but I tried it anyway with the same result. Dave
I'm running into a problem with a java app constantly throwing: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class java.net.ProxySelector. I am running Suse Linux 10.3 and running java 1.6.0. My CLASSPATH is set to /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-openjdk/lib. No other users seem to be having this error so I'm assuming its my setup.

I get the following error: INFO: validateJarFile(C:\dev\server\tomcat6\webapps Sempedia\WEB-INF\lib\servlet-api.jar) - jar not loaded. See Servlet Spec 2.3, sectoin 9.7.2.

I am updating an existing project from GWT 1.5.2 to GWT 2.0.0. We use maven 2 to manage our dependencies and do all of our development in Eclipse 3.5. Because we use maven to manage our dependencies, I do not have all of those jars in the war\web-inf\lib directory as GWT specifies. Instead, they are in the maven repository, just where maven likes them. I have the project set up so that maven can successfully build and launch in either dev or web mode and the application runs correctly. The problem is that when I launch from Eclipse, I get a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If I manually copy of my dependencies into war\web-inf\lib before launching, everything runs fine, but that doesn't lend itself to a long-term solution. First, if I check all of those jars into our version control, that will subvert much of the value we get from maven. As annoying as maven can be, ditching it is not the answer. Second, having developers manually copy them over every time they want to debug something is ridiculous. So can I get Eclipse to copy the dependencies into war\web-inf\lib before launching? Is there an alternate solution that I'm missing? Thanks, Tony
I have a problem when I try to instantiate Hibernate and connect with a MySQL database (see error message below). Curiously enough the connection works fine using the exact same hibernate.cfg.xml file when running Junit tests but it refuses to work when run from Tomcat... I am starting to run out of ideas.

I have several libraries that I want to import into my project. They are all Jar files I've created, and they were built using Eclipse, then preverified using the command-line tool. Now, I'm working in the BlackBerry JDE (not Eclipse) and I've added the Jar files into my main project. Originally, it wouldn't compile, complaining about a stack map error. That's what prompted me to preverify the jars. Now, I can import classes from the Jars, and it compiles just fine, but as soon as I try to run the application on the simulator and access a class in the Jar, it throws a MissingNativeError. I've tried separating each Jar file out into its own Library project within the workspace and setting up the project references properly, but nothing changed. The little I've found on this error online isn't helpful. The one person who solved this issue says they did so by changing the Library to a CDLC application, but if I do that, then I can't even set projects to depend on it. What is the CORRECT way that WORKS to create a library of code that can be included in other projects, other than including the source files in each project? Does it involve using the COD files instead? Is there ANY other way to make it work? Note: The JAR files are in some other directory not anywhere near the project or workspace, though that shouldn't be a problem. When I compile the project, the libraries show up in the simulator directory, and the jar files contain all the right classes from what I can see.
I'm in a Math class about coding theory and we have to do a project for our term mark. My project is a client with an echo server, which shows what errors were introduced in the trip from the client to the server, and then back. And test different error correcting schemes for efficiency and how well they are suited to this task. The coding isn't really a problem, I was able to make something that would detect errors, ask for retransmission if unable to fix them and such. The problem I have is that so far, for me to introduce any type of bit error, I must do it artificially -- since other layers of data transfer have their own error correction protocols. My question: Is there a way to get around this? I have no idea how I would go about this or even where to begin. Also, I know there are protocols I can't tinker with so theres always going to be error correction going on in the background at those levels. But what I'd like is to be able to pretend that one of these layers wasn't checking things itself and then my application would be given the chance to play that role. If this can't be done, what are some good methods of simulating errors introduced during transmission. I was unable to find statistical information about the distribution of errors in even a simple example of a channel. Given those I could continue with the current approach of having the server introduce errors in the message.
Is there a way to log all exceptions happening within JVM? A system is built from a big number of smaller components provided by different groups. All of them are running within the same JVM (under Weblogic). Error reporting policies are rather different in those groups, so sometimes we have cases of suppressed exceptions, which makes troubleshooting very hard. At the same time, I noticed that JDB is able to intercept any exception happening in the code, no matter where. I'd like to use the same facility JDB uses in DEV/SIT/UAT environment to shorten issue resolution time. In PTE and PROD though the facility shall not only be turned off, but create no performance impact require no code change for turning it off. Of course, I can have JDB connected to every instance of server running in DEV/SIT. It's feasible, I guess... but there are two main downside: it makes configuration more complex JDB stops when an exception has occured; need a script or something to let it continue So I wonder is there any method that does it, e.g. Runtime.traceExceptions(...)?
I'm trying to create a test that simulates a system failure to ensure the integrity of a Oracle Berkeley DB XML database. Data loss is currently being experienced during an insert operation so I'd like to setup a test that starts inserting an arbitrary number of documents and sack the process along the way (akin to someone yanking the power cord). After the process dies I want to spawn a new process and open the database to ensure it opens properly. The unit test is one of many in a maven build and this test has to run in linux and windows XP environments. My current thought process is to hammer out a script for both operating systems since I can use the script to kill the process and start a new one in its place. Do I have any other options? Can I create a separate process space / VM using JUnit?
I've built something on Google App Engine that acts as a backend for an iPhone app. In the app, there are interactions that are pushed out to social networks via their APIs. So the typical workflow is like this: User uses the iPhone app to do "something" App Engine app is alerted via HTTP App Engine alerts social network that user did "something." If the user were to check their profile on that network, their activity via the app would be displayed. So, as far as the user is concerned, what they did probably worked. App Engine needs to do some persistence on its own, but when it tries, a DatastoreTimeException is thrown. And now the data is in a funky state. So what's a good way to handle this? By nature of the problem I'd love to wrap it in a "transaction", but there's no way to roll back what got sent to the Social Network. So, I'm thinking more along the lines of how do you handle a DatastoreTimeException? Should I just wrap it in a try block and give it another go? Is it a better idea to show the user an error, and then when they try again, "skip" the social network interaction so that it isn't pushed out twice? Is there another idea that I'm not thinking of here?
I have a Java production system with IBM JVM running on Linux. A customer reports the following exception printed to the log: java.lang.ClassCastException: [B incompatible with java.lang.String When trying to cast the individual attributes returned from: javax.naming.directory.InitialDirContext(...) From this exception I can't figure out what is the type that could not be converted to String. What is "B"? Normally, I know that a class cast error message should look something like this: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer incompatible with java.lang.String But as you can see it's not the case in the first printout. I thought that there might be an actual class named B, but I could find one under javax.naming... Is there a name obfuscation going on here? I now plan to send the customer a version that will print out the class of the instance before trying to cast to string: i.getClass().getCanonicalName() But these ping pongs take a week, if you have an idea and could help me out before that, that would be super!
All right, I've hit a bug that has simply confused the bejeebus out of me. I'm looking for ideas about what it could be that I can investigate, because right now, I got nothing. It goes something like this: I have a standalone Java application that occasionally needs to twiddle the Line-In volume of the computer it's running on (a WinXP machine). It does this by calling a pair of external executables (written in VB6*) that can get and set various component volumes. (They can handle Line-In, Mic, Wave, CD, and the master volume control.) There are several hundred units in the field, running on hardware (Dell machines) that my company provided and controls. At least several dozen clients are using this feature, and it works perfectly -- except for one instance. For this one troublemaking machine, it simply doesn't work. I watch the volume sliders when the app is running, and when the volume is supposed to drop, they stay put. When I check the app's log file, it throws no errors, and appears to be executing the code that drops the volume. When I run the executables from the command line, they work perfectly. I can't vouch for this machine being 100% identical to all the ones that are behaving properly, but we've been buying the same line of Dells for quite some time now; at a bare minimum, it's very, very similar. So, turning my confusion into a bullet list: If I'm doing something stupid in the Java code (i.e., not clearing my STDOUT/STDERR buffers), why is it only an issue on this machine? If there's something broken in the VB6 executables, why do they work on every other machine and on this machine from the command line? If there's some sort of hardware oddity on this machine, what sort of oddity could cause the volume control executables to fail only when called from within a Java application? I am very confused. I do not like being confused. Anybody have any suggestions that may lead to my enlightenment?** -* -- I know, I know, VB6, 1998 called and they want their obsolescent proprietary bug generator back, etc. Wasn't my decision. But the code works. Usually. -** -- Insert Buddhism joke here. Update Edit: Customer service may have stumbled onto something; it may be something to do with client configuration settings in the database. New evidence suggests that either something's misconfigured for that client or my software is doing something stupid in response to a specific configuration. And the problem may be more widespread than we thought, due to this particular feature not being as commonly used as I thought. Responding to the comments: Debugger: Theoretically possible, but looks like a massive headache given our setup. High Verbosity Logging, Java: Good idea this, particularly given than the problem may be more widespread than I originally believed. Time to start revisiting some assumptions. And possibly clubbing them. Like baby seals. High Verbosity Logging, VB6: A possibility; will need to be rolled-into the high-verbosity Java logging to trap the output, since my VB6-fu is so pitiably weak I don't know how to output text to a file. But, yeah, knowing whether or not the script is even getting called would be valuable. Window Event Viewer: Not familiar with this tool. May have to correct that. PATH problem: Doesn't feel likely; the Java code constructs a relative path to the executable that doesn't look like it's relying on any environment variables. My thanks for the suggestions people have provided; at the very least, you've gotten my brain moving in directions that feel promising. Solution Edit: And the winner is ... That's Not A Bug, That's A Feature! A feature gone horribly, horribly wrong. A feature that will now be neutered so as to stop bothering us. A batch of invalid assumptions kept me from seeing it sooner, not the least of which was "I don't need to tool the code with more debug statements -- the statements already in there are telling me all I need to know!" DaDaDom, if you'd like to turn your comment into an answer, there's a shiny checkmark in it for you. Thanks to everybody who chimed in with a suggestion. Now if you'll excuse me, my head is late for a meeting with my desk.
I am developing a medium size Java Web Application with Struts as MVC framework and simple JDBC at Data Access Layer. I have been searching for exception handling best practices in such an application. I have found several articles, some of them being contradictory, only making me more confused rather than making things clear and simple. Some say it is better to reuse existing exceptions instead of defining application specific exceptions, others present a huge hierarchy of application specific exceptions for every minor trouble that may occur in the system. Some say it is better not to handle exceptions at Data Access Layer and delegate them to the Service Layer, others say Data Access Layer exceptions should be caught locally since delegating them to Service Layer would violate the abstraction between the two layers. And so on. I would highly appreciate if you let me know of links/names to articles/books that present solid solutions which have worked for you in such a scenario. The solution should clear at least the following points with justifications: Where the SQLExceptions be caught? Where exceptions should be logged? Should unchecked exceptions be logged? Should unchecked exceptions be caught at presentation layer, and should they be shown to the user? How checked exceptions be handled, which of them to be shown to the user and how? How should a global exception handler page be used? How should struts ActionErrors be used in this context? Thanks

I have a Eclipse Dynamic Web Project which host a simple servlet and runs on Tomcat. I use Hibernate within - I have classes that map to database tables and hbm.xml files for them within my project. Everything works fine - I can use Hibernate from Servlet and modify database tables through classes. But now I want to move my "model" (Java classes for SQL tables and mapping files) to a separate Eclipse project so that I can use this "model" from other projects. After I specify a reference from my Web project to the "model" project, Eclipse can see the references and allows me using classes, but when I deploy and run the project on Tomcat, there are always errors like: org.hibernate.MappingNotFoundException: resource: xxx/yyy/zzz/model/MyClassTable.hbm.xml not found I suspect this is because I have to put classes for the model into WEB-INF directory, but I have no other idea how to do it than doing it manually. What is the correct way to configure Web Project in that case?

I am getting the error: "The Network Adapter could not establish the connection" from a web application deployed in Oracle Application Server 10g. The database is local, so there shouldn't be any connection issues. First test: I can connect to the DB no problem from SQL plus, run queries, etc. Second test: I can connect to the database no problem from a locally installed JDeveloper on the server, and run queries, etc. no problem. This works with the short JDBC scring, and the long one (shown below). jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=abcd)(SERVER=DEDICATED))) Yet when I run the web app, it gives the above error. It seems too generic for me to do anything about. Any suggestions on how to solve this? I assume that Oracle logs failed connection attempts somewhere, but I couldn't find anything relevant in the databases alert.log file. It is possible that the problem is that the application is using an old jsdk, but I would assume that then some version mismatch error would be given instead of a "network connection" message. Edit: I don't know whether this is an OAS problem or a problem with the specific Web Application, I would like to figure this out first, as it seems it should be easy. In WebSphere, there is a "test connection" button to dest data-sources you have added, but it seems there is no such functionality in OAS10? Somehow I think there must be, and I am just missing it because I am not an OAS expert. Edit 2: I installed JDevelop on a remote machine and connected to the database with no problems, so I know for sure it isn't an issue with the database connectivity itself - it seems like it must be a problem within OAS?
The problem: I am trying to debug some focus-related problems in my Java Swing application. There are times when some components seem to be grabbing focus and I cannot figure out where in code this is happening. What I have tried: A VetoableChangeListener with KeyboardFocusManager (for focusOwner). This does give me information about which components lose and gain focus, but it does not help me pin point where in code the focus is being requested. A custom KeyboardFocusManager. But in that too I can intervene only when it receives events. By that time the call stack of the call to requestFocus is already lost. A custom EventQueue. But there too I am able to intervene in the dispatchEvent method which is again called from the EDT. Again the call stack is lost (interestingly the postEvent(AWTEvent) is not called). Question: What I am looking for is the call stack when the call to requestFocusInWindow is made. Is it possible to get this information. Perhaps, if I could redefine the method used to post the event in EventQueue, then I can print the stack dump. However the EventQueue.postEvent(AWTEvent) does not get invoked. Can anyone suggest a solution which will help me get the state of the stack when the call to requestFocus or requestFocusInWIndow may have been made?
I have service object (Service A), that has some specific repetitive asynchronous task . This service object also has a supervising object (Service B). I want to handle most of the errors concerning the specific task in Service A and only inform Service B if it needs to take any additional measures (e.g. when Service A does not know how to handle the error). Since Service A depends on external resources (e.g. network availabilty) there are many different exceptions, that can be thrown and I do not know all of them right now. Because of that I would also like to have a pluggable eror-handling strategy inside Service A so that it can handle different exceptions differently. I would like to plug in those stratgies using my IoC container. Example A: Service A is supposed to download something every 30 sec. (polling), but the URL is malformed so a MalformedURLException is thrown. A looks up the error handling strategy for MalformedURLExcpetion and in this case the strategy will mean canceling the download and informing Service B (the supervisor) via a callback. Example B: Service A is supposed to download something, but the hostname cannot be resolved. Again an Exception is thrown (sorry don't know exact type now) and the corresponding strategy will be looked up: in this case the download should be stalled and retried at another time until a certain threshold is hit. My problem now: How should I implement this dynamic lookup of error handling strategies and the strategies themselves? Is there a pattern for that?
When attaching the debugger in an IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse) to a JVM running in another continent (london to new york) the lag is unbearable. I've waited in excess of 10 minutes for IntelliJ to populate my stackframes and fill out objects before giving up when hitting a breakpoint. (note: ive never seen a fully populate debug state when doing this!) This makes remote debugging using an IDE impossible! I am aware of the jdb tool, which doesn't experience any such lag issues. I imagine because it is more fine-tuned to specific data retrievals from the VM rather than populating each stack frame and all accessible values. Is anyone aware if there is an intermediate ground? I find jdb cumbersome to use - I would love to see a UI (built atop of jdb) that did not experience the lag issues of an IDE. Does anyone know if such an application exists? Does anyone know of other techniques to debug remote VMs executing thousands of miles away?
I have a problem relative to JNI and Java. Here is the thing : the client wants us to install a certain app on his system. This app uses native libs, but the client does not want to put these libs in his system folder, for reasons I don't really know or understand, but can't change. To circumvent thius problem, I tried to launch the JVM with -Djava.library.path, putting the right dlls in it. But the fact is, I have a UnsatisfiedLinkError when I try to launch my project. From what I can see, the problem is not in the main dll called (because the file obviously exists, I saw it when debugging), I think that must be some of the libs linked by this first dll that are problematic, but I don't know how to find what dll is missing. Any idea on how to solve this problem ?
I am doing a project on applets. I designed the applet using netbeans. After building the project in netbeans, I took the directory "classes" and a .html file from the "build" directory and moved it to another new directory. This .html file includes the applet. The .html file displays the applet correctly, when it is viewed from my desktop. I uploaded the "classes" folder and the .html file to my free server (host4ufree.com) using FileZilla. If I try to view the webpage online, I get the following error instead of the applet getting displayed: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Extra bytes at the end of class file I am using JDk 1.6.0 update 18, and uploaded the file using FileZilla both ASCII and binary format manner. Yet, I am not able to solve the error problem. Does anybody know the solution to this? Is there something wrong in the manner in which I'm trying to add the applet to my webpage?
We have recently been migrating a number of applications from running under RedHat linux JDK1.6.0_03 to Solaris 10u8 JDK1.6.0_16 (much higher spec machines) and we have noticed what seems to be a rather pressing problem: under certain loads our JVMs get themselves into a "Death Spiral" and eventually go out of memory. Things to note: this is not a case of a memory leak. These are applications which have been running just fine (in one case for over 3 years) and the out-of-memory errors are not certain in any case. Sometimes the applications work, sometimes they don't this is not us moving to a 64-bit VM - we are still running 32 bit In one case, using the latest G1 garbage collector on 1.6.0_18 seems to have solved the problem. In another, moving back to 1.6.0_03 has worked Sometimes our apps are falling over with HotSpot SIGSEGV errors This is affecting applications written in Java as well as Scala The most important point is this: the behaviour manifests itself in those applications which suddenly get a deluge of data (usually via TCP). It's as if the VM decides to keep adding more data (possibly progressing it to the TG) rather than running a GC on "newspace" until it realises that it has to do a full GC and then, despite practically everything in the VM being garbage, it somehow decides not to collect it! It sounds crazy but I just don't see what else it is. How else can you explain an app which one minute falls over with a max heap of 1Gb and the next works just fine (never going about 256M when the app is doing exactly the same thing) So my questions are: Has anyone else observed this kind of behaviour? has anyone any suggestions as to how I might debug the JVM itself (as opposed to my app)? How do I prove this is a VM issue? Are there any VM-specialist forums out there where I can ask the VM's authors (assuming they aren't on SO)? (We have no support contract) If this is a bug in the latest versions of the VM, how come no-one else has noticed it?
I'm developing a web app using netbeans with GlassFishv3. Every once in a while when I add a new feature in my app, glassfish starts nagging with stupid errors, after a lot of time wasting and panicking, i restart glassfish and run my application again, then suddenly the errors all go away and my site starts acting correctly. (or in case I have made a real mistake, i receive a reasonable & descriptive error from GF.) [Edit: the rest of the question was revealed to have been my own mistake.] But the problems don't end there. Recently, i added the ability to write comments in a (JSF) page, after the user submits their comment, i add it to the database and redirect to the same page, so that hopefully the page refreshes with the new comment, but it wont! The underlying Mysql database shows that the new comment has been added, but the page just wont show the new comment! I've tried everything (e.g. deleting browser cache, using different browsers) but only after restarting GF is when the page shows the new comment! Do you have any idea what the problem could be? Could this be a Glassfish bug? What i am using: JSF2, EJB3.1, JPA, MySql
I have a Java Struts app in Eclipse and I'm looking for a way to see the values of request and session's variables (as the NetBeans display them), when running the app on Tomcat. For some reason, the "Variable View" in debuggin mode is always empty, no way to fill it with variables I need to follow. Internal or external browser, no difference. Please give me some hints, thx ONE DAY LATER:Thank you for the answers. I will refine a little further my question, because still I'm not getting what I want. My reference is the table displayed in NetBeans (the "HTTP Monitor") were I can see the parameters and attributes associated with every Get or Post, ordered in "Request", "Session", "Context" tab. In Eclipse the closer I can get now is to display in the "Expressions" view the variables I need. The problem is that there are not updated! For example, a "_client" variable linked with a drop-down select control will not reflect the changes. Rather than a snapshot of the variable, I need a dynamic overview. Any ideas?
I’ve been surprised by how hard it is to find best practices for this on the web since it must be such a common problem. App is based on Java 1.5 – JSF 1.2 with Faclets, Seam, JPA, Hibernate. Some Web Service calls. Some JMS. I’m after general recommendations for Exception handling. There are roughly 3 approaches I’ve seen used but I’ve never been that sure which one is better. Assuming you can’t recover from an error do you: 1) Log the error when it occurs and re-throw it? 2) Log it when it occurs and throw some sort of generic exception? 3) Let it bubble up and then handle it in a generic exception handling servlet or similar. I’ve tended to use option 2 on previous systems where the architecture has been fairly simple – an adaptor layer talking to various 3rd party systems throws and adaptor exception if it gets an error back and so on. We can display a nice clean message to the user on the screen and keep the details in a log. Here though the architecture is a lot more complex and I’m wondering how well it would work in practice. So I’m interested to know what you prefer and why.
I use Eclipse to write Java code and use DropBox to sync my code with others' across our multiple computers. Most of the time, everything works as expected: if anyone makes a change on either end, the change is saved and when the other person refreshes the Eclipse workspace, the changes come through and can be viewed and run successfully. Sometimes, one of several errors arises. Sometimes Eclipse says it cannot find a main class and sometimes it says it could not find the class itself. Sometimes it will not report an error but for some reason will not actually update the .class file and therefore run an old version even though the compiler displays the new source code and that saves. I've then noticed that if I manually copy the code into a new .java file elsewhere in the file system and then compile it, it works fine, but for some reason it refuses to regenerate the .class file and I have to delete it manually and replace it with the one generated in the other project--then it works. But for solving the other problems everything needs to be manually copied, deleted, and re-pasted.... [The actual errors include NoClassDefFoundError, UnsupportedClassVersionError, and some other error related to not having a main class.] I realize that the description here is somewhat vague, but unfortunately I'm not entirely sure what's going on. I hope I'm just missing some basic fact that would help solve all these problems. Thanks!
I know how to remote debug a java application on a machine where it already exists, but does anyone know of a solution that can launch from a local workspace (e.g. eclipse), transfer any code in the local classpath to a remote or virtual machine, execute it there and connect a remote debugger, all in one step? I expect some kind of server would need to run on the remote machine to accept class-files and execute them. I once did something similar with JUnit, transfering local testcases to a remote machine via RMI and executing them there, transferring the results back to my eclipse. Because those testcases are JUnit-tests it was easy to integrate this with the JUnit-launcher and -tools from eclipse, but for debugging the whole application I suspect it to be a bit more complicated. I would like to ask if there are any solutions for this or if anyone has done this before and would point me in the right direction. There is something similar for VMWARE Workstation, but I develop on a Mac and it is not avaliable in Fusion.
I'm trying to consume an ASP.NET Webservice from a Java application. The java app is being built with Eclipse on a Windows box. I've installed the Webservice tools for Eclipse and I've downloaded the Axis 1.3 files and extracted all of the supporting .jar files (axis.jar, saaj.jar, etc) into my java\lib folder. My environtment variables are: JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6; CLASSPATH = .;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\lib; However, when debugging the project I get this error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/axis/AxisFault The file it's happening on has "import org.apache.axis.AxisFault;" up top and that's as far as I've gotten. I'm VERY new to Java and come from a .NET C# background, so I'm a little fuzzy on whether you copy .jar files into the main java\lib folder or if they should be somewhere else. Everything I read on getting axis to work is for Apache Tomcat and setting up Webapplication folders and etc. I don't really need that as this is just a plugin module for Wowza and so the the jar file just gets execute by Wowza, but fails when trying to access the Webservice. Is my classpath wrong, or am I missing something else? Any guidance would be great!
I am having a hard time tracking this down since the profiler keeps crashing (hotspot error). Before I go too deep into figuring it out I'd like to know if I really have a problem or not :-) I have a few thread pools created via: Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); The threads connect to different web sites and, on occasion, I get connection refused and wind up throwing an exception. When I later on call Future.get() to get the result it will then catch the ExecutionException that wraps the exception that was thrown when the connection could not be made. The program uses a fairly constant amount of memory up until the point in time that the exceptions get thrown (they tend to happen in batches when a particular site is overloaded). After that point the memory again remains constant but at a higher level. So my question is along the lines of is the memory behaviour (reported by "top" on Unix) expected because the exceptions just triggered something or do I probably have an actual leak that I'll need to track down? Additionally when Future.get() throws an exception is there anything else I need to do besides catch the exception (such as call Future.cancel() on it)? EDIT: so I did tale a look with a couple of tools and from the Java point of view there is nothing going on memory leak wise. I'll play around with some other code that lives for a long time and throws an exception after a while and see if the memory reported by "top" also increases. Seems like it may just be some sort of oddity.
Originally posted on Server Fault, where it was suggested this question might better asked here. We are using JBoss to run two of our WARs. One is our web app, the other is our web service. The web app accesses a database on another machine and makes requests to the web service. The web service makes JMS requests to other machines, aggregates the data, and returns it. At our biggest client, about once a month the JBoss Java process takes 100% of all CPUs. The machine running JBoss has 8 CPUs. Our web app is still accessible during this time, however pages take about 3 minutes to load. Restarting JBoss restores everything to normal. The database machine and all the other machines are fine, only the machine running JBoss is affected. Memory usage is normal. Network utilization is normal. There are no suspect error messages in the JBoss logs. I have set up a test environment as close as possible to the client's production environment and I've done load testing with as much as 2x the number of concurrent users. I have not gotten my test environment to replicate the problem. Where do we go from here? How can we narrow down the problem? Currently the only plan we have is to wait until the problem occurs in production on its own, then do some debugging to determine the cause. So far people have just restarted JBoss when the problem occurred to minimize down time. Next time it happens they will get a developer to take a look. The question is, next time it happens, what can be done to determine the cause? We could setup a separate JBoss instance on the same box and install the web app separately from the web service. This way when the problem next occurs we will know which WAR has the problem (assuming it is our code). This doesn't narrow it down much though. Should I enable JMX remote? This way the next time the problem occurs I can connect with VisualVM and see which threads are taking the CPU and what the hell they are doing. However, is there a significant down side to enabling JMX remote in a production environment? Is there another way to see what threads are eating the CPU and to get a stacktrace to see what they are doing? Any other ideas? Thanks!
Possible Duplicate: NoClassDefFoundError - Eclipse and Android I'm seeing this question is getting asked a lot in many different contexts. Perhaps we can set some strategies for locating and fixing it? I'm noobish myself so all I can contribute are horror stories and questions, sorry... It seems this is thrown when a class is visible at compile time but not at run time... how can this happen? In my case I am developing an app that uses the Google APIs, in Eclipse, for the Android platform. I've configured the Project Properties / Java Build Path / Libraries to include the gdata .jars and all is well. When I execute in the emulator I get a force close and the logcat shows a NoClassDefFoundError on a simple new ContactsService("myApp"); I've also tried a new CalendarService("myApp") with the same results. Is it possible or desirable to statically bind at compile time to avoid the problem? How could dynamic binding of an add-on library work in the mobile environment anyway? Either it has to be bound into my .apk or else I need to "install" it? ... hmmm. Advice much appreciated.
OK, so I am writing a program that unfortunately needs to use a huge data structure to complete its work, but it is failing with a "out of memory error" during its initialization. While I understand entirely what that means and why it is a problem, I am having trouble overcoming it, since my program needs to use this large structure and I don't know any other way to store it. The program first indexes a large corpus of text files that I provide. This works fine. Then it uses this index to initialize a large 2D array. This array will have n² entries, where "n" is the number of unique words in the corpus of text. For the relatively small chunk I am testing it o n(about 60 files) it needs to make approximately 30,000x30,000 entries. This will probably be bigger once I run it on my full intended corpus too. It consistently fails every time, after it indexes, while it is initializing the data structure(to be worked on later). Things I have done include: revamp my code to use a primitive int[] instead of a TreeMap eliminate redundant structures, etc... Also, I have run the program with-Xmx2g to max out my allocated memory I am fairly confident this is not going to be a simple line of code solution, but is most likely going to require a very new approach. I am looking for what that approach is, any ideas? Thanks, B.
I've created a Java project from existing source with an Ant build script in Eclipse. I cannot run my project because Eclipse tells me that there is at least one error in it. Now, I know that the project runs fine on the command line, so I suspect an Eclipse configuration error. As far as I can tell, the only feedback that I have from Eclipse is a little red X on my project in the Package Explorer window Eclipse Error Package Explorer http://gregmattes.com/EclipseErrorPackageExplorer.png and dialog window when I try to run the project says there are errors in the project Eclipse Error Dialog http://gregmattes.com/EclipseErrorDialog.png This is all wonderful, but what is the error? Is there a "show me the next error" button somewhere? In the past, on other Eclipse projects, I've notice other little red X's on folders containing source files with errors, the little red X's appear on the source files as well. I scanned (manually) through all of the source files and I haven't found any other red X's (again, where is the "next error" button?). If I select the "Proceed" button I am greeted with a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError for my main class, which makes me suspect a classpath issue. I've checked the classpath, and I'm fairly certain that it's correct. Is there a way to see the exact jvm command line that Eclipse is invoking? I realize that it might be invoking the JVM programmatically, and not on a "real" command line. In any case, is there a way, other than the run configuration dialog, to see what is actually happening when I hit the "Proceed" button?
I'm getting the following exception when executing the first preparedstatement after a period of inactivity: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure The last packet successfully received from the server was 2,855,054 milliseconds ago.

Subsequent queries execute normally. I suspect it's some kind of timeout issue, but the periods of inactivity are way below the 8 hour timeout for MySQL. Any suggestions?
I'm re-implementing a old BBS MUD game in Java with permission from the original developers. Currently I'm using Java EE 6 with EJB Session facades for the game logic and JPA for the persistence. A big reason I picked session beans is JTA. I'm more experienced with web apps in which if you get an OptimisticLockException you just catch it and tell the user their data is stale and they need to re-apply/re-submit. Responding with "try again" all the time in a multi-user game would make for a horrible experience. Given that I'd expect several people to be targeting a single monster during a fight I think the chance of an OptimisticLockException would be high. My view code, the part presenting a telnet CLI, is the EJB client. Should I be catching the PersistenceExceptions and TransactionRolledbackLocalExceptions and just retrying? How do you decide when to stop? Should I switch to pessimistic locking? Is persisting after every user command overkill? Should I be loading the entire world in RAM and dumping the state every couple of minutes? Do I make my session facade a EJB 3.1 singleton which would function as a choke point and therefore eliminating the need to do any type of JPA locking? EJB 3.1 singletons function as a multiple reader/single writer design (you annotate the methods as readers and writers). Basically, what is the best design and java persistence API for highly concurrent data changes in an application where it is not acceptable to present resubmit/retry prompts to the user?
I have a non-signed java applet interacting with the same host. Every time I click on an element in my page, the applet (which is a third part applet I have no control on) should load data from a URL. I say should, because for some files, I get java.security.AccessControlException : access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission http.agent read) and some other files are correctly loaded. All files are correctly readable and downloadable from the web server, and they are very simple text files. I also found that, in some cases, files that previously returned the error are now loaded and continue to load, so it seems a cache is involved somehow. Does any of you have an idea of what's going on here ? The behavior seems to be absolutely random, and I have no way of performing debug on this thing. Note: I used this applet to perform many other "single shot" file access, and it never gave me any problem. The only apparent difference I have is that now I do it "on-demand" via a javascript event. What could be the cause, in the java of the applet or anywhere else ?
I've written a basic Java applet which works as a map viewer (like Google Maps) for a game fansite. In it, I've implemented an A* pathfinding algorithm on a 2D map with 16 different floors, "connected" on certain points. The floors are stored in PNG images which are downloaded when needed and converted to byte arrays. The node cost is retrieved from the pixel RGB values and put in the byte arrays. The map contains about 2 million tiles, spread over 16 floors. The images are 1475 x 2000 (15-140 KB for the PNG images) big, so some of the floors contain a lot of empty tiles . The byte arrays will be huge in memory, resulting in a “java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space” error for most JVM configurations. So my questions are Is there anyway to reduce the size of these byte arrays and still have the pathfinder function properly? Should I take a different approach to finding the optimal path, not having the tiles in memory? I would think finding a path on the web server would be too CPU intensive. Best regards, A
I've developed a simple applet that imports an image from the clipboard. When i run the class file from NetBeans, everything works fine. But when i try to run it as an applet ... it gives me lots of errors in the java console and does not run ... - The applet is signed - There is a static method in one class, called getImageFromClipboard(). When the applet runs, it calls this method. - getImageFromClipboard() method has a try-catch block and suppresses all errors. It simply returns either a BufferedImage or null. - When applet runs, it does some visual adjustments before calling getImageFromClipboard() Now the scenario is as follows: the class from netbeans runs, fails to import the image and adjusts the interface accordingly (displays an error in a label) But when i run it in a browser, java console is filled with errors and nothing after the getImageFromClipboard() line works. Although the applet itself loads and does everything it's supposed do do before importing the image. So why am i getting errors if i accept the certificate and all of the possible errors are in try-catch blocks? None of this code should throw any exceptions. Any ideas why this is happening? Or do you need to see the errors to tell? UPDATE I've managed to find out the problem myself. The class that i'm using is not in the jar file :( How do i add it in? I'm using "add jar folder" in netbeans on the libraries package to import it but it does not seem to get copied to the jar.
I am trying to search a large string w/o spaces for a smaller string of characters. using regex I can easily find perfect matches but I can't figure out how to find partial matches. by partial matches i mean one or two extra characters in the string or one or two characters that have been changed, or one of each. the first and last characters will always match though. this would be similar to a spell checker but there are no spaces and the strings dont contain actual words, just random hex digits. i figured a way to find the string if there are no extra characters using indexOf(string.charAt(0)) and indexOf(charAt(string.length()-1) and looping through the characters between the two indexes. but this can be problematic when dealing with randomized characters because of the possibility of finding the first and last characters at the correct spacing but none of the middle characters matching. i've been scratching my head for hours on this issue. any ideas?
For no apparent reason all my Swing GUI forms using components linked to org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Converter started generating errors when trying to open the Design View: Error Error in loading component property: [JPanel]->filterTextField->converter. Cannot load property type class org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Converter. The property cannot be loaded. Errors occurred in loading... I'm currently using Netbeans 6.8. I opened my project in Netbeans 6.7.1 and all was fine but after a while the same thing happened. Looking at the .form and .java files and comparing it to previous backups, everything looks fine. Even my Netbeans tutorial project no longer works. What can cause this. Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

We use TeamCity for continuous integration and Git for source control. Generally it works pretty well - convenient, modern and good us quick feedback when tests fails. There is a strange behavior related to Git merge specifics. Here are steps of the case: First developer pulls from master repo. Second developer pulls from master repo. First developer makes commit A locally. Second developer makes commit B locally; Second developer pushes commit B. First developer want to push commit A but unable because he have to pull commit B first. First developer pull's from remote reposity. First developer pushes commit A and generated merge branch commit. The history of commits in master repo is following: B second developer A first developer merge branch first developer. Now let's assume that Second Developer fixed some failing tests in his commit B. What TeamCity will do is following: Commit B arrives - TeamCity makes build #1 with all tests passed Commit A arrives - TeamCity makes build #2 (without commit B) test bar becomes Red! TeamCity thought that Pending "Merge Branch" commit doesn't contain any changes (any new files) - but it actually does contain the merge of commit B, so the TeamCity don't want to make new build here and make tests green. Here are two problems: 1. In our case we have failed tests returning back in second commit (commit A) 2. TeamCity don't want to make a new build and make tests back green. Does anybody know how to fix both of this problems. I consider some reasonable general approach.
My team has a situation where an SNMP SET will fail once every two weeks or so. Since this set happens automatically, we don't necessarily notice it immediately when it fails, and this can result in an inconsistent configuration and associated wailing and gnashing of teeth. The plan is to fix this by having our software automatically retry the SET when it fails. The problem is, we aren't sure why the failure is happening. My (extremely limited) knowledge of SNMP isn't particularly helpful in diagnosing this problem, so I thought I'd ask StackOverflow for some advice. We think that every so often a spike in network traffic will cause the SET to fail. Since SNMP uses UDP for communication, I would think it would be relatively easy for a command to be drowned out if traffic was high for a short period of time. However, I have no idea how common this is. We have a small network with a single cisco router and there are less than a dozen SNMP controlled devices on that network. In addition to the SNMP traffic, there are some status web pages being loaded from the various devices. In case it makes a difference, I believe we are using the AdventNet SNMP API version 4.0.4 for Java. Does it sound reasonable that there will be some SET commands dropped occasionally, or should we be looking for other causes?
I developed an enterprise application using spring, struts and hibernate, now I want to transfer it to work with OSGi dm server. I found a book "Pro SpringSource dm server" where the author has explained a way to migrate WAR to OSGi bundles. I successfully migrated the application given in book. The first step of migration says that remove the lib folder in WEB-INF directory and import all the relevant packages. I did the same. Application has been successfully deployed in the dm server. But when I tried to connect to URL it is giving me the error: SpringSource dm Server - Error report HTTP Status 503 - Servlet action is currently unavailable type: Status report message: Servlet action is currently unavailable description: The requested service (Servlet action is currently unavailable) is not currently available. What could be the reason for this? I am out of clues to solve this issue. Can you pass any help you may have. Thanks in anvance.
I have a graph structure in java, ("graph" as in "edges and nodes") and I'm attempting to serialise it. However, I get "StackOverflowException", despite significantly increasing the JVM stack size. I did some googling, and apparently this is a well known limitation of java serialisation: that it doesn't work for deeply nested object graphs such as long linked lists - it uses a stack record for each link in the chain, and it doesn't do anything clever such as a breadth-first traversal, and therefore you very quickly get a stack overflow. The recommended solution is to customise the serialisation code by overriding readObject() and writeObject(), however this seems a little complex to me. (It may or may not be relevant, but I'm storing a bunch of fields on each edge in the graph so I have a class JuNode which contains a member ArrayList<JuEdge> links;, i.e. there are 2 classes involved, rather than plain object references from one node to another. It shouldn't matter for the purposes of the question). My question is threefold: (a) why don't the implementors of Java rectify this limitation or are they already working on it? (I can't believe I'm the first person to ever want to serialise a graph in java) (b) is there a better way? Is there some drop-in alternative to the default serialisation classes that does it in a cleverer way? (c) if my best option is to get my hands dirty with low-level code, does someone have an example of graph serialisation java source-code that can use to learn how to do it?
I'm trying order pairs of integers ascendantly where a pair is considered less than another pair if both its entries are strictly less than those of the other pair, and larger than the other pair if both its entries are strictly larger than those of the other pair. All other cases are considered incomparable. They way I want to solve this is by defining a Comparator that implements the above, but will throw an exception for incomparable cases, and provide that to a PriorityQueue. Of course, while inserting a pair the priority queue does several comparisons while bubbling the new entry up to its correct position in the heap, and many of these will be comparable. But it may happen during the bubbling process that a pair is encountered with which this new pair is incomparable, and an exception will be thrown. If this happens, what will be the state of the PriorityQueue? Will the pair I was trying to insert sit in the heap at the last position it was in before the exception was thrown? If I use the PriorityQueue's remove(Object o) method, will the PriorityQueue be restored to a consistent state? Thanks
I made this program: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html And it works perfectly if I put the server's hostname as 127.0.0.1 or my computers name (Ajay-PC). However these 2 methods are LAN or local only not internet. So I changed it to my internet ip. 70.128.xxx.xxx etc. But it didn't work. I checked: canyouseeme.org and it said 4444 was CLOSED. So I did a quick port forward. Portforward: Name: My Java Program Start Port: 4444 End Port: 4444 Server IP: 10.0.0.12 <-- (Yeah this is my Local IP I checked) then I tried canyouseeme.org AGAIN: and it said 4444 was OPEN I ran my server client program and it yet to work. So my problem is the client server program is not working on the internet just locally. So something is blocking it and I don't know what. EDIT: It's not blocked because as I checked the port is open. But I am recieveing a IO exception not a UnknownHost Computer: Windows Vista x64 Norton AntiVirus 2010 Thanks! I'll give best answer or whatever to who ever answers the best ;) :)
Do you agree that the designers of Java class java.io.IOException should have made it an unchecked run-time exception derived from java.lang.RuntimeException instead of a checked exception derived only from java.lang.Exception? I think that class IOException should have been an unchecked exception because there is little that an application can do to resolve problems like file system errors. However, in When You Can't Throw An Exception, Elliotte Rusty Harold claims that most I/O errors are transient and so you can retry an I/O operation several times before giving up: For instance, an IOComparator might not take an I/O error lying down, but — because many I/O problems are transient — you can retry a few times, as shown in Listing 7: Is this generally the case? Can a Java application correct I/O errors or wait for the system to recover? If so, then it is reasonable for IOException to be checked, but if it is not the case, then IOException should be unchecked so that business logic can delegate handling of this exception to a separate system error handler.
I prefer to have the exception handling logic further up in the call stack, near the main method. I like this approach... However, I created a thread where some of its method calls inside run() may throw exceptions. I would really like to see if there is a way that these exceptions can be thrown back up to the parent thread? The best I could think of is setting a variable inside the object that implements Runnable. This variable is a string that contains the Error Message, which then uses a class loader to correctly re-create the same exception in the parent thread. What I would like to know, is there a less messy way of getting what I want here? (to be able to make sure that any exception thrown in a child thread is handled with the same exception handling logic as though it was running in the main thread/code re-use).
I'm experiencing a bizarre problem with sockets between a Java Knopflerfish client bundle and a PHP (CLI, not web) server. The client/server pair work fine when both are located on the localhost, and all data is transmitted successfully. However, when the Java client exists on a different machine, connections to the server are successful, but no data is received by the PHP script. Packet analysis confirms that the data sent by the Java client is received on by the server - PHP just seems to have problems getting its hands on it. As a further note, I've done some tests with telnet as the client. The PHP server script receives all data fine from any host. This leads me to believe that the problem has something to do with the way java is setting up the socket or that there is some networking issue that I'm not familiar with. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Can post code samples if desired.
I'm on the android bandwagon and started going through google's "view" tutorials. Here is what I'm using: Eclipse Galileo Android SDK 2.1 Java SDK 6.Something I think. Everything was hunky-dory until I hit the grid view tutorial. I got errors all over the place when I started editing the "HelloGridview.java" File. I thought I'd fix it by following through with the next part of the tutorial, creating the ImageAdapter class, but it created more. I realized alot of my issues could be resolved by importing widgets which were not mentioned in the tutorial (i.e. android.widget.GridView, .ImageView, .BaseAdapter etc.) However, after all the reconciliation suggested by eclipse the files were finally showing no errors. I go to run it as an android app and bam, "Your project contains error(s)." window comes up. There are no errors showing on the files I've created. I cleared the error log and shut down eclipse and started again the error log now reads: Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1. I'm a little lost at this point. I think I've included the required information. If you need to know more let me know. Any help is appreciated.

I am a brand new Java developer (I have been working in asp.net) and I inherited a project I am trying to get running correctly. I am on Windows 7 and have Tomcat installed and I am using Eclipse I'm trying to figure out how the heck Jar's work in java and I am really confused at the moment. I have been playing around with it and looking up stuff on the web for about a day now and this is where I am: I have a dynamic web project which I inherited and it has what I am going to assume is a fairly standard project layout. There is a lib folder in the project root which contains some jar's. If I don't do anything and go to a particular page in the site I get this error: "The import net.sf cannot be resolved, XLSTransformer cannot be resolved to a type" So I added jxls-core-0.9.8.jar to my build path in Eclipse and that error went away but now I am getting this error "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: net.sf.jxls.transformer.XLSTransformer" I copied that jar from its current location to the tomcat/lib directory and that error went away. Now I am getting essentially the same issue with another file. Mainly I just need to know how should jar's work? Do they need to be in the class path, in web/WEB-INF/lib, in tomcat/lib, in all of them, none of them I just can't figure it out. Also when I was looking around I saw some stuff that indicated the order of my classpath entries matters as well. If that is the case how do you insure you have them in the correct order.
I've got problems starting my WAR application on a local JBoss. After two other EARs are deployed and the TomcatDeployer begins deploying the WAR, I'm getting the following error message: 2010-04-28 10:01:56,605 ERROR [org.jboss.ejb.plugins.LogInterceptor] [] [main] EJBException in method: public abstract [return type] methode throws javax.ejb.CreateException,java.rmi.RemoteException, causedBy: javax.ejb.EJBException: org.springframework.beans.factory.access.BootstrapException: Unable to initialize group definition.

I am banging my head against a mess of JNI code and DLLs that we are trying to shoehorn into an OSGi bundle. It has been particularly hard to get good debugging info out of the system and I have spent too much time stepping through raw byte code trying to infer what is happening inside equinox--when I really don't care--I am just not getting useful errors out. It would be great if I could have easy access to the equinox source in the debugger to see why and where it was loading what. The simple answer of downloading all the source and building my own Eclipse would be one solution, but it feels very heavy handed. Is there a "grab source" repo I could go to and install from or some such thing? It just feels like there should be an easier way to go about this. Something akin to using the debug libraries or installing the SRPM in another situation.
I'm validating the installation of a program that consists of a few separate modules. They are not co-dependent. I have apple.jar and orange.jar, they are placed in the same folder and were developed in the same project, but run independent of each other. Running apple.jar goes fine, but orange.jar gives me a NoClassDefFoundError pointing to apple.jar. /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/bin/java -jar validator.jar Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: orange/client/Apple Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: orange.client.Apple at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassInternal(Unknown Source) Could not find the main class: validator/client/StormDataXMLGenerator.

This is a follow-up question to 1832203. I'm making it a new question as well, because it seems that posting an answer to a question doesn't change its position on the java page and so I'm worried that it won't get seen. Apologies if I've just stepped on some etiquette toes. I'm an IntelliJ newbie -- started using it two days ago and I'm absolutely head-over-heels in love! One of the things I adore is the code inspections. However... In one of my classes I often create exceptions without throwing them. If I can't turn off (or downgrade) the inspection warning for this then I can see I'm going to end up ignoring inspections on at least that file (if not the entire project), which would be a real pity. I've done a search in the inspection settings for "exception", and found nothing that relates exactly, so I turned them all off just to see, and it's still doing it (even after a rebuild...BTW when are inspections redone? at save? at rebuild? ???), so I would really like some help on how to make this one into an info/typo level -- which I can then ignore. Using the free version, if that makes any difference TIA to all those experienced IntelliJ warriors out there!
Occasionally, somewhere between once every 2 days to once every 2 weeks, my application crashes in a seemingly random location in the code with: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded. If I google this error I come to this SO question and that lead me to this piece of sun documentation which expains: The parallel collector will throw an OutOfMemoryError if too much time is being spent in garbage collection: if more than 98% of the total time is spent in garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered, an OutOfMemoryError will be thrown. This feature is designed to prevent applications from running for an extended period of time while making little or no progress because the heap is too small. If necessary, this feature can be disabled by adding the option -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit to the command line. Which tells me that my application is apparently spending 98% of the total time in garbage collection to recover only 2% of the heap. But 98% of what time? 98% of the entire two weeks the application has been running? 98% of the last millisecond? I'm trying to determine a best approach to actually solving this issue rather than just using -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit but I feel a need to better understand the issue I'm solving.
I had an annoying issue, getting a "Possible loss of precision" error when compiling my Java program on BlueJ (But from what I read this isn't connected to a specific IDE). I was surprised by the fact that the compiler told me there is a possible loss of precision and wouldn't let me compile/run the program. Why is this an error and not a warning saying you might lose precision here, if you don't want that change your code? The program runs just fine when I drop the float values; it wouldn't matter since there is no point (e.g [143.08, 475.015]) on my screen. On the other hand when I loop through an ArrayList and in this loop I have an if clause removing elements from the ArrayList it runs fine, just throws an error and doesn't display the ArrayList [used for drawing circles] for a fraction of a second. This appears to me as a severe error but doesn't cause (hardly) any troubles, while I wouldn't want to have such a thing in my code at all. What's the boundary?
The process will run fine all day, then, bam, without warning, it will throw this error. Sometimes seemingly in the middle of doing nothing. It will happen at seemingly random times during the day. I checked to see if anything else was running on the machine, like scheduled backups or something, but found nothing. The machine has enough physical memory (2GB, with about 1GB free for a 3-500MB load), and has sufficient -Xmx specified. According to our sysadmin, the problem is that the RAM that the kernel uses as a disk cache (apparently all but 8MB) is not freed when the JVM needs to allocate memory, so the JVM process throws an OutOfMemoryError. This could be because Java asks the kernel if enough memory is available before allocating and finds that it is insufficient, resulting in a crash. I would like to think, however, that Java simply tries to allocate the memory via the kernel, and when the kernel gets such a request, it makes room for the application by throwing our some of the disk cache. Has anyone else run in to the issue, and if so, what was the error, and how did you solve it? We are currently using jdk1.6.0_20 on SLES 10 SP2 Linux 2.6.16.60-0.42.9-smp in VMWare ESX.
I have a scenario where I have code written against version 1 of a library but I want to ship version 2 of the library instead. The code has shipped and is therefore not changeable. I'm concerned that it might try to access classes or members of the library that existed in v1 but have been removed in v2. I figured it would be possible to write a tool to do a simple check to see if the code will link against the newer version of the library. I appreciate that the code may still be very broken even if the code links. I am thinking about this from the other side - if the code won't link then I can be sure there is a problem. As far as I can see, I need to run through the bytecode checking for references, method calls and field accesses to library classes then use reflection to check whether the class/member exists. I have three-fold question: (1) Does such a tool exist already? (2) I have a niggling feeling it is much more complicated that I imagine and that I have missed something major - is that the case? (3) Do you know of a handy library that would allow me to inspect the bytecode such that I can find the method calls, references etc.? Thanks!

In the beginning there is a problem that wants to be solved. In my case i got an LazyInitializationException while using indexof in a Collection to retrieve an Object for manipulation. Here i start to think about using equals in EntityBeans (OR-Mapper at all). I know there are some discussions about overriding equals in association with OR-Mapper as hibernate like [1] Entities equals(), hashCode() and toString(). How to correctly implement them? [2] To equals and hashcode or not on entity classes, that is the question. [3] Overriding equals and hashCode in Java I currently have some entities which implements the equals but inside the code i could not use equals several times because of the LazyInitializationExceptions. So i had to workaround and use eg. the name property of the object to identify it's equality. From my point of view the whole 'LazyInitializationException-thing' is not really mentioned in this questions. I'd like to know have you got some good patterns or real live recommendations how to avoid such exception in an equal-Method. Shall i use some helper Methodes to distinguish if a Object of a class is already initialized (4) or should i apdicate the use of equals and use helper classes instead (2)? And what is about catching LazyInitializationExceptions in the equals? [Edit]: If you put equals in context with the initialization of the Object then it will gain importance. Sometimes it is nessesary to have the Object fully initialized but sometimes you don't want to. Because you just need the Object itself (name, id, ...) not its Collection-Properties. So just for equalization you have to reattach the Object and load the whole bunch you don't realy need? Are there any other solutions for such a problem?
I'm currently working on a plug-in for Eclipse that translates some custom Java code (which doesn't necessarily run/compile), to runnable Java code. In particular, the plug-in allows code to be written using classes created or imported during the translation. In general, the pre-translation code runs/compiles fine provided the writer uses import statements at the top of their class files. However, it would be convenient for my users if it was not necessary to import these classes. At the moment, the lack of import statements results in (obvious) compiler errors. Would it be possible to empower my plug-in to either a) suppress/ignore these errors, or b) have Eclipse find these classes automatically, without the use of import statements? I should point out that the translated code would these include the required import statements--but this is not a problem for me. I'm also aware that this could lead to lazy programmers and some bad habits. To clarify, consider the following example of pre-translated code: File f = new File("Somefilename.txt"); which clearly requires the possibly imported class File. Without an import statement (import java.io.File;), Eclipse reports that File can not be resolved to a type. This is the error I'd like to hide in files pertaining to projects created for use with my plug-in. (The translated code would include import java.io.File; so that it would be runnable) In closing, I should point out I'm not necessarily looking for code (though I wouldn't be opposed to it), but rather some links to some relevant tutorials (if they exist), or helpful tips/ideas. Also, as this is my first plug-in, it's entirely possible that what I'd like to do is not possible and that I don't realize it--if this is the case, please let me know, preferably with some justification. Thanks!
Let me describe my question - I have a Java application - Hibernate as the DB interfacing layer over MySQL. I get the communications link failure error in my application. The occurence of this error is a very specific case. I get this error , When I leave mysql server unattended for more than approximately 6 hours (i.e. when there are no queries issued to MySQL for more than approximately 6 hours). I am pasting a top 'exception' level description below, and adding a pastebin link for a detailed stacktrace description. javax.persistence.PersistenceException: org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException: Cannot open connection - Caused by: org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException: Cannot open connection - Caused by: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure - The last packet successfully received from the server was 1,274,868,181,212 milliseconds ago. The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. - Caused by: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure - The last packet successfully received from the server was 1,274,868,181,212 milliseconds ago. The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. - Caused by: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect the link to the pastebin for further investigation - http://pastebin.com/4KujAmgD What I understand from these exception statements is that MySQL is refusing to take in any connections after a period of idle/nil activity. I have been reading up a bit about this via google search, and came to know that one of the possible ways to overcome this is to set values for c3p0 properties as c3p0 comes bundled with Hibernate. Specifically, I read from here http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/index.html that setting two properties idleConnectionTestPeriod and preferredTestQuery will solve this for me. But these values dont seem to have had an effect. Is this the correct approach to fixing this? If not, what is the right way to get over this? The following are related Communications Link Failure questions at stackoverflow.com, but I've not found a satisfactory answer in their answers. com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException:Communications link failure How to handle: Communication link failure Note 1 - i dont get this error when I am using my application continuosly. Note 2 - I use JPA with Hibernate and hence my hibernate.dialect,etc hibernate properties reside within the persistence.xml in the META-INF folder (does that prevent the c3p0 properties from working?) edit - the c3p0 parameters I tried out are in the comments
I'm trying to pick up Java and wanted to test around with Java's client/server to make the client send a simple object of a self defined class(Message) over to the server. The problem was that I kept getting a ClassNotFoundException on the server side. I think the rest of the codes seem to be alright because other objects such as String can go through without problems. I had two different netbeans projects in different locations for client and server each. Each of them have their own copy of Message class under their respective packages. Message class implements Serializable. On the client side, I attempt to send a Message object through. On the server side, upon calling the readObject method, it seems to be finding Message class from the client's package instead of it's own. printStackTrace showed: "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: client.Message" on the server side I have not even tried to cast or store the object received yet. Is there something I left out?

I have an extremely odd problem in my JUnit tests that I just can't seem to nail down. I have a multi-module java webapp project with a fairly standard structure (DAO's, service clasess, etc...). Within this project I have a 'core' project which contains some abstracted setup code which inserts a test user along with the necessary items for a user (in this case an 'enterprise', so a user must belong to an enterprise and this is enforced at the database level) Fairly simple so far... but here is where the strangeness begins some tests fail to run and throw a database exception where it complains that a user cannot be inserted because an enterprise does not exist. But it just created the enterprise in the preceding line of code! And there was no errors in the insertion of the enterprise. Stranger yet, if this test class is run by itself everything works fine. It is only when the test is run as part of the project that it fails! And the exact same abstracted code was run by 10+ tests before the one that fails! f I have been banging my head against a wall with this for days and haven't really made any progress. I'm not even sure what information to offer up to help diagnose this. Using JUnit 4.4, Spring 2.5.6, iBatis 2.3.0, Postgresql 8.3 Switching to org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource from org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource changed the problem. Using DriverManagerDataSource the tests work for the first time, but now all of a sudden a lot of data isn't rolled back in the database! It leaves everything behind. All with no errors Tests fail when run via Eclipse & Maven Please ask for any info which may help me solve my problem! Update: I have turned up the logging to the max. There is only one slight difference between this test that fails, and another just like it which succeeds. The difference is highlighted. After the error occurs I see a number of "Creating [java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap]" lines and then the error handling code begins The test that fails The test that succeeds
This is a pre-existing Java project being run in Eclipse 3.5.2 32 bit.. Day 1: Install Java SE 6 Update 20 JDK. Experience Crash in Eclipse. Install Java 5. Same problem-(uninstall java 5). Re-install Java 6. Install Eclipse 3.3.1. Install Eclipse 3.5.2. 32-bit. No problems. Run Eclipse 3.5.2. 64-bit. No problems. Set up the project, configure, and run. No problems. Day 2: Load Eclipse to start a new project. Previous project now has 940 errors. Error Type is "Java Problem". The project ran 100% without a problem on Day 1. The only thing that happened between Day 1 and Day 2 was restarting my computer. I just tried to recreate the project, step by step, and am still getting the same errors. I know it's not the code -- it was working. Not to mention that it's an opensource project, such a problem would be documented. I'm thinking something is wrong with my Java install. Or, perhaps, it's a 32-bit/64-bit problem. I'm running win7 64bit. So before formatting my Windows partition, I thought I'd throw the problem your way to see if anyone knows what's going on. Thanks.
I am currently working on an image processing demonstration in java (Applet). I am running into the problem where my arrays are too large and I am getting the "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" error. The algorithm I run creates an NxD float array where: N is the number of pixel in the image and D is the coordinates of each pixel plus the colorspace components of each pixel (usually 1 for grayscale or 3 for RGB). For each iteration of the algorithm it creates one of these NxD float arrays and stores it for later use in a vector, so that the user of the applet may look at the individual steps. My client wants the program to be able to load a 500x500 RGB image and run as the upper bound. There are about 12 to 20 iterations per run so that means I need to be able to store a 12x500x500x5 float in some fashion. Is there a way to process all of this data and, if possible, how? Example of the issue: I am loading a 512 by 512 Grayscale image and even before the first iteration completes I run out of heap space. The line it points me to is: Y.add(new float[N][D]) where Y is a Vector and N and D are described as above. This is the second instance of the code using that line. EDIT: The upper bound, as I mentioned but forgot to correct should be around: 20+ x500x500x5 (20 iterations, 500 width, 500 height, 5 dimensions (where 3 comes from RGB and 2 for the coordinates (The coordinates move and so do the pixels, so I need to record the values, which can and are decimals)) (Approx. 100000000 bytes)
I'll explain what I mean by input error checking. Say you have a function doSomething(x). If the function completes successfully doSomething does something and returns nothing. However, if there are errors I'd like to be notified. That is what I mean by error checking. I'm looking for, in general, the best way to check for errors. I've thought of the following solutions, each with a potential problem. Flag error checking. If doSomething(x) completes successfully return null. Otherwise, it returns a boolean or an error string. Problem: Side effects. Throwing an exception. Throw an exception if doSomething(x) encounters an error. Problem: If you are performing error checking for parameters only, throwing an IllegalArgumentExceptionseems inappropriate. Validating input prior to function call. If the error checking is only meant for the parameters of the function, then you can call a validator function before calling the doSomething(x) function. Problem: What if a client of the class forgets to call the validator function before calling doSomething(x)? I often encounter this problem and any help or a point in the right direction would be much appreciated.
I deployed a WAR file into $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps by copying the file into the directory, just like I've done a thousand times before. Tomcat detects the WAR and inflates it. I can traverse the directory tree on my server at the command line (it's Fedora). But when I address the webapp within my client machine's browser, I get nothing but 404 errors. This has happened to the last two deployments of completely separate WARs. The first was a replacement of an existing WAR. I first deleted the WAR and its inflated directory, and then copied in the WAR which inflated... 404. I deleted everything again, put back the previously working WAR from backup. It inflated and worked. The second was a completely new, never before deployed WAR... nothing but 404. Other WARs are working, but now I'm afraid to change anything until I know what is going on. Any clues? Edit: From my comment you can see that the logs included "SEVERE: Error listenerStart" after the WAR was deployed by Tomcat. There were no stack traces or other errors reported. Edit2: Turns out the second WAR was looking for the ELResolver and could not find it. This was buried in the localhost log file.
From time to time I got the following exception message on GAE for my GAE/J app. I searched with Google, no relevant results were found. Does anyone know about this?

Here's a use case: I have a desktop application (built using Eclipse RCP) which on start, pops open a dialog box with 'UserName' and 'Password' fields in it. Once the end user, inputs his UserName and Password, a server is contacted (a spring remote-servlet, with the client side being a spring httpclient: similar to the approaches here.), and authentication is performed on the server side. A few questions related to the above mentioned scenario: If said this authentication service were to go down, what would be the best way to handle further proceedings? Authentication is something that I cannot do away with. Would running the desktop client in a "limited" mode be a good idea? For instance, important features/menus/views will be disabled, rest of the application will be accessible? Should I have a back up authentication service running on a different machine, working as a backup? What are the general best-practices in this scenario? I remember reading about google gears and how it would let you edit and do stuff offline - should something like this be designed? Please let me know your design/architectural comments/suggestions. Appreciate your help.
I use log4j in my project and wanted to use FallbackErrorHandler for Backup-Reasons. So, when I want to implement a FallbackErrorHandler, you have to use the DOMConfigurator and that for a XML-Configurationfile. But now, my customer doesn´t really like XML and looking for a way, he can configure the Logging-behaviour himself, I got the idea to load the basic configuration with the help of java-properties und instantiating the higher Appender or ErrorHandler with Java-Code, which I could configure with parameters. The configuration of the ErrorHandler worked so far, the log4j-debug showing everythings correct, but I ran into a problem I could not solve until yet. My FallbackErrorHandler starts logging to the backupAppender already at the start of the programm, not when a standard appender failed. I couldn´t figure out what I´ve done wrong, I can post the code of the properties and the java-code if somebody wants to look at it, but at first, I wanted to ask, whether somebody ran into the same problem or has any experiences with configuring log4j within Java?
We have a two tier Swing application using Hibernate. Sometimes we manipulate an object in one session (A), which we know in another session (B) as well (two different Java Instances, same database record). In this case after commit and closing of A, we refresh the object in session B, in order to show the updated state in the UI. Works fine in most of the cases. But if we have an object X with a collection of Ys we get a problem with the following sequence of events: B: load X and Ys A: load X and Ys A: remove one Y from the collection and the database A: flush, commit and close the session B: refresh X At the last step we get a UnresolvableObjectException which seems to happen, because B the X keeps its collection (instead to refreshing the collection itself) and tries to refresh each contained instance of Y which of course fails when reaching the deleted one. If found problem descriptions about similar problems when refreshing collections, but no solution no bug report no explanation, that this is by design So these are my questions: How can I solve my problem (Even a pointer into the source code with a post it 'fix here' would be of help)? Is this a bug? If so, is it a known one?
Consider this pair of Throwable: IllegalAccessExceptionextends Exception Thrown when an application tries to reflectively create an instance (other than an array), set or get a field, or invoke a method, but the currently executing method does not have access to the definition of the specified class, field, method or constructor. IllegalAccessErrorext IncompatibleClassChangeError ext LinkageError ext Error Thrown if an application attempts to access or modify a field, or to call a method that it does not have access to. Normally, this error is caught by the compiler; this error can only occur at run time if the definition of a class has incompatibly changed. Questions Can someone give a code example where each is thrown? Does the similarity in name imply relationship between the two, or is it just pure coincidence? Are there other XXXError and XXXException combo? How are the pairs related to each other? If you explicitly try to catch one in an Exception/Error pair, should you also catch the other?
I'm relatively new to Java, eclipse and android so this could be a completely silly question, but I'm going to ask it none the less. I've got a project I'm learning with to test connecting to the flickr api and simply displaying recent images. I'm at the point now where I want to parse the JSON received from flickr. I've downloaded gson 1.4 and added the zip to the java build path through "add external jars." It's successfully loaded and I can see google-gson under referenced libraries in the package explorer. My problem is, when I try to use it, I simply get an error. Gson gson = new Gson(); It highlights Gson and says that "Gson cannot be resolved to a type." What am I missing here? It worked once and has since stopped. I've tried removing the jars, cleaning the project and re-adding the jars but it still doesn't work. Am I just completely noobing this up or is there another problem?
Whenever there is an error during the load of a JSF facelet, JSF stops rendering the page at the point of the error and shows the error page instead (default behavior). I want JSF to continue rendering a page instead and show the exception/error within the page. For example if the page is loading a "portlet", which throws an exception, that exception would be shown as text within the portlet. I don't want the whole page to be forwarded to a separate error page. I have initialized my own ExceptionHandlerFactory and ExceptionHandler implementations and I can iterate over the ExceptionQueueEvents succesfully. However, I don't know how to instruct JSF to continue loading the page despite of the error. Is this even the right approach at all? Is the ExceptionHandler called after (as I suppose) or in the middle processing the facelet? If after, is there anything I can do within my ExceptionHandler? I know I should: Hide the parts that user cannot access (my specific case relates to security, when user tries to load content he does not have rights to. However, I am looking for a global answer to this) Manually handle the errors so unexpected exceptions would not be thrown However, I want the user to be able to continue using the system despite of some minor component failure (for example if some newsfeed portlet throws an error that shouldn't prevent the user from seeing other content and using it). I am using Mojarra 2.0.2. I feel this is a very simple to solve but I cannot figure it out :(
i have a severe problem with eclipse, where i need to compile a somewhat larger class. by "larger" i mean, the class has about 5000 lines of code... problem is that on saving this project, eclipse takes several seconds (30-40) to "build the workspace". to be exact, it says "50%" and keeps saying that for 30-40 seconds. then, it breaks with the following error: [console]: [2010-07-09 15:28:39 - Dex Loader] Unable to execute dex: null [2010-07-09 15:28:39 - myProject] Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: null [problems window]: Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: null this error is reproducible and keeps popping up until i comment out several thousands LOC, so that the file still has this 5k LOC, but ~2000 of them are comments. THEN it works... i know that 5000 LOC are no really good programming style, but i need to do it this way for now ... (i have to write this much records to a sqlite database and since sqlite doesnt feature multiple sql-queries in one rawQuery-command i have to execute a single rawQuery() for each and every data record i need to push into the db.... - until i write a file reader to read this data from a file (that needs verification etc)), i'm stuck with this solution...) how do i get eclipse and the android sdk to accept files this big? (system: ubuntu 10.04 x86, eclipse 3.6)
Today while programming, I suddenly started to get a JVM Error 104 and the except read "Error starting XXXX: Module 'XXXX' attempts to access a secure API". I hadn't gotten them before and I wasn't doing anything too radical. I undid my work to a point where it was previously working and the error continued to show. I am aware that certain functions require code to be signed, but the documentation says that even functions that need to be signed will work in the simulator. (using JRE 4.6, version 1,1 of the plugin, on a Bold 9000 simulator) Any ideas on how to remove this error so I can continue working? EDIT: I noticed that it works fine on the "Blackberry-SDK - 8900" but I get the error when using the "SimPackage - 4.6.0.307_9000 - 9000" EDIT: It only seems to be a problem with the "SimPackage - 4.6.0.307_9000 - 9000" simulator which I downloaded seperately from the Blackberry Developers page. EDIT: Clearing simulator data seemed to do the trick
In order to debug failing requests I would like to print all information coming from HttpServletRequest. Now, it's possible that a request will partially fail (for ex. Several matches are successful, yet one has failed) in which case I would like to catch the exception in the internal method that failed, print the error + the ServletUtil.toStringHttpServletRequest() and continue providing service (degraded but still useful vs. complete request failure). Our current implementation either catches the exception and prints dumb info ("getRules failed") or throws the exception all the way to doGet() (effectively canceling service for the user) where as in doGet() I have access to HttpServletRequest where I can print at the relevant debug info (headers, parameters...). Passing HttpServletRequest to every function called during the request that might fail seems a bit ugly, I will do it if no other elegant solution will pop up. Making a before head ServletUtil.toStringHttpServletRequest() and storing it in a ThreadLocal map would be wasteful both in memory and CPU time. For some reason it feels wrong to store the HttpServletRequest object in ThreadLocal (please correct if I'm wrong). Debug information is written both to local machine log and is emailed directly to devs (Great work log4j TLSSMTPAppender), so logging in several places won't be practical (Will need to assemble several emails to understand what's going on) and ssh'ing into the server is old age :) (We're all cloudy here... server might not exist by the time I get to look at the error) So, my solution is gaining access to a "PrintErrorUtility" (TODO: better name it). That will receive (String errorMsg, Throwable t, HttpServletRequest) which will print the error together will all the relevant info... This will be called from internal try {} catch blocks that will notify about the error but will not cancel the request because of it. Obviously I'm taking about servers running in production. Comments? Please advise. Thank you, Maxim.

I'm currently working on some concurrent code that would appear to have a few race conditions in it. I'm attempting to debug the code using my current IDE, Eclipse, but I'm not completely satisfied. In particular, a race condition is present for a variable such that without a break point on one of the methods accessing it (the one 'getting' it), the variable setting method does not complete, and the variable is set to null. However, if I put a break point on the accessing method, and hold F8--the default step over button--the variable is almost always set to the correct (non-null) value. This leads me to ask the following: is it possible that Eclipse doesn't pause execution on the breakpoint across all threads quickly enough that I can look at the potential race condition as it appears without a break point, or is something else (probably) happening? If it is the case that Eclipse doesn't pause execution quickly, are there other IDEs/debuggers for Java that may do a better job of this? Note that I'm not looking for formal verification tools like Java Pathfinder--I don't want to check if race conditions are present, I want to see them unfold in my debugger (if only because it might be interesting to watch).
Typical scenario for me: The legacy code I work on has a bug that only a client in production is having I attach a debugger and figure out how to reproduce the issue on their system given their input. But, I don't know why the error is happening yet. Now I want to write an automated test on my local system to try and reproduce then fix the bug That last step is really hard. The input can be very complex and have a lot of data to it. Creating the input by hand (eg: P p = new P(); p.setX("x"); p.setY("x"); imagine doing this 1000 times to create the object) is very tedious and error prone. In fact you may notice there's a typo in the example I just gave. Is there an automated way to take a field from a break point in my debugger and generate source code that would create that object, populated the same way? The only thing I've come up with is to serialize this input (using Xstream, for example). I can save that to a file and read it back in in an automated test. This has a major problem: If the class changes in certain ways (eg: a field/getter/setter name is renamed), I won't be able to deserialize the object anymore. In other words, the tests are extremely fragile.
Would you throw an IllegalStateException if: A method is unable to do its job because of the value(s) of one or more fields Those fields are final and assigned only in the constructor? Textbook example: your class is an immutable Collection<BigInteger> and your method is supposed to return the maximum element, but this instance is empty. I have read Kevin Bourillon`s blog post on the subject and I am not sure which rule applies. UnsupportedOperationException - this means that the method invoked will always fail for an instance of this class (concrete type), regardless of how the instance was constructed. Definitely not. Many instances of this class are not empty and the operation would have succeeded. IllegalStateException - ... there does exist at least one alternate state that the instance in question could have been in, which would have passed the check ... <snip> ... Note also that this exception is appropriate whether or not it is possible to actually mutate this aspect of the instance's state, or it's already too late. Not quite. This instance was constructed with zero length, so this instance is not and could never have been non-empty. IllegalArgumentException - throwing this exception implies that there exists at least one other value for this parameter that would have caused the check in question to pass. Might apply if the parameter in question is the implicit this parameter. This is the exception I am tempted to throw, but I am concerned that it could be confusing. Update: changed example from Collection<Integer> to Collection<BigInteger> because the fact that there was an identity element (Integer.MIN_VALUE) distracts from the question.
Possible Duplicate: Unchecked exceptions in Java: Inherit from Error or RuntimeException? Looking at how our applications do error handling, we have been steadily moving from a checked ExceptionHierarchy (e.g. Exception -> ApplicationException -> SomethingSpecificBadHappenedException) since in many cases we have many long call chains that just pass up ApplicationException, and it adds little value but cluttering our API (we increasingly agree with the opinions expressed in: Effective Exceptions. In redesigning our error handling around unchecked exceptions, aligned with a "fault barrier" approach, we initially have started working with a RuntimeException based hierarchy, similar to the example in the Spring Data Access layer We've been starting to wonder if it would be more clear to have them descend from Error, especially around the fact that it would let us do something like a: } catch (Exception e) { within our application in a number of spots, but then differentiate with: } catch (Throwable t) { or } catch (Error err) { which feels cleaner, though I can't think of major examples of APIs following this. Am looking for examples from preferably common APIs of where to root our exception/error hierarchy, or comments on style or functional differences that should dictate one root in preference to the other.
I'm trying to follow this tutorial to try and begin to understand the Visual Library. I followed it step by step, checked everything... and everytime I try to run the thing, I get this : Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/openide/util/LookupListener at vislibdemo.GraphSceneImpl.attachNodeWidget(GraphSceneImpl.java:49) at vislibdemo.GraphSceneImpl.attachNodeWidget(GraphSceneImpl.java:19) at org.netbeans.api.visual.graph.GraphScene.addNode(GraphScene.java:100) at vislibdemo.GraphSceneImpl.(GraphSceneImpl.java:34) at vislibdemo.Main.initComponents(Main.java:39) at vislibdemo.Main.(Main.java:28) at vislibdemo.Main.main(Main.java:22) Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.openide.util.LookupListener at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:307) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:248) ... 7 more I guess I got a problem with the libraries... but I added them exactly as the tutorial said I should.

I'm currently writing something to work around this Java bug: http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=5049299 Basically, I've got a light weight C server that runs on the same machine as the Java server. I'm adding a feature to the C server when I can request it to fork/run a new process via a socket and pass back stdin/stdout/stderr. On the Java side, I've created something that mimics the behavior of ProcessBuilder and Runtime.exec(), but over the socket. The problem arises with stderr. Java sockets don't have an error stream, so I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to get it back over. I've come up with two potential solutions: Create a second socket (probably from the C server back to the Java server) where in I just send stderr back over. Interleave the output of process with the stderr of the process and then parse them apart in the Java back into separate streams Both solutions have inherent problems, so I'd love to hear any feedback anybody has. BONUS: Give me an easy, guaranteed solution to the Java bug that doesn't involve me doing any of this and I'll be your best friend forever.
I have a smallish number (2-10) of largeish files (6-15GB) that compress really well (4:1). I'm writing the client and server in Java, and I want to send the files from the client to the server, so that 1. the client compresses the files as they are sent (i.e. no intermediate .zip file is created) 2. the compressed stuff on the server ends up as a well formed file (e.g. a .zip or .tgz file) so that it can be downloaded 'as is'. 3. the transfer can be resumed if it fails mid-way through 4. the resumed transfer might happen in a new process altogether The first two can be achieved pretty easily using java.io sockets and java.util.zip ZipOutputStreams. The third is the one causing me grief. The fourth is really just context. I'm guessing a solution will possibly require some sort of partial re-transmit or re-parse to establish a dictionary, or something. Are there any Java libraries that support resumable compression?
I just learnt basic Servlets and JSP technology and am designing a simple website using it. The aim of the website is to sell products. The details of the products are stored in the database. I want to retrieve the data from the database and display the dynamic pages. I am using the MVC approach and trying to make it as OO as i can. I am facing problem with the category page (which is intended to act as an index for the various products...i want to retrieve the categories stored in the DB and display them). The details are as follows: I have created a simple java class which represents the table. The table's name is "Categories" in the DB...This class is named CategoryTable and contains instance fields representing various attributes of the table. A POJO named CategoryRetriever acts as my Model. it inserts the data of a particular row from the table into an object of CategoryTable and finally creates an ArrayList of the various CategoryTable Objects. This ArrayList contains all the retrieved data. The Controller of the Design is a Servlet names CategoryController. it creates and object of the CategoryRetriever and passes this to a JSP named CategoryDisplayer. All the things are getting compiled fine. Except the JSP. After deploying with WEBLOGIC. the jsp gives the following error. G:\bea\weblogic81\server\bin.\myserver.wlnotdelete\extract\myserver_MiniProject_build\jsp_servlet__categorydisplayer.java:173: cannot resolve symbol symbol : class CategoryTable location: class jsp_servlet.__categorydisplayer CategoryTable tp = (CategoryTable)categoryContent.get(i); //[ /CategoryDisplayer.jsp; Line: 35] ^ From this what I can infer is that the JSP which is directly under the root project directory cannot find the CategoryTable class which is inside root>>WEB-INF>>source. Does my JSP require an include statement or something? If yes, how to do it?
Seeing a checked expection in API is not rare, one of the most well known examples is IOException in Closeable.close(). And often dealing with this exception really annoys me. Even more annoying example was in one of our projects. It consists from several components and each component declares specific checked exception. The problem (in my opinion) is that at design time it was not exactly known what certain exceptions would be. Thus, for instance, component Configurator declared ConfiguratorExeption. When I asked why not just use unchecked exceptions, I was told that we want our app to be robust and not to blow in runtime. But it seams to be a weak argument because: Most of those exceptions effectively make app unusable. Yes, it doesn't blow up, but it cannot make anything exepting flooding log with messages. Those exceptions are not specific and virtually mean that 'something bad happened'. How client is supposed to recover? In fact all recovering consists from logging exception and then swallowing it. This is performed in large try-catch statement. I think, that this is a recurring pattern. But still checked exceptions are widely used in APIs. What is the reason for this? Are there certain types of APIs that are more appropriate for checked exceptions?
I'm defining a java class from C with the JNI call DefineClass() and then I register the native callbacks for the methods in the class that are native. The class has two static methods, both of which are native. I use RegisterNatives() to register the native functions. Both calls succeed. But when I reference these native methods from my Java code I get java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError myPackage.myClass.myMethod(I)V But I know that DefineClass returned a class object for myPackage.myClass and I know that myMethod(I)V has been registered as a method on that class. I get this failure just as it is about to execute main() - where the call to my native method is (for the time being, for testing). As a test, I tried calling DefineClass twice on the same JNIEnv to see what happened. I get a duplicate class definition error. I've also tried calling FindClass() after defining it and the JNIEnv returns a reference to the defined class. Thus I'm definity creating the class dynamically, but it fails when I try to refer to its methods. Any ideas? All input appreciated. Platform: Windows, 32 bit code on 64 bit XP.
I had a MIDlet project called Numbers that I decided to rename to Digits. Instead of simply renaming it, I decided to create a brand new project from scratch, so that I can have new directory, package name, .jad/.jar names, etc. Everything went fine, I copied the .java files to /src and resource files to /res and recompiled successfully. I used Eclipse Helios and Nokia's Series 40 5th Edition SDK, Feature Pack 1, for both projects. Now, for some weird reason when the MIDlet starts in the emulator, it throws a NullPointerException, but not immediately on startup, but after a splash screen (it's a game). I haven't touched the code at all, so I rule out the possibility of an exception in the code, since it worked just fine when the project was called Numbers. After an hour of trial and error, I found a weird thing: if I open up the Application Descriptor and change the MIDlet name property from "Digits" to "Numbers" (old project name), everything runs perfectly and no exception is thrown. I did a text search in all project files and the word "Numbers" only appears in the Application Descriptor and the .jad file, and only after I change the MIDlet name property, otherwise that string is nowhere to be found (no class names, no variables, no other properties, neither in the code nor in the project have a string "Numbers"). Where is that reference coming from? A bug in Eclipse or Series 40 emulator? What gives?
I am not as familiar with Java's exception packages as with those of .NET. I'm in a situation where, if programming in C#, I would throw a System.InvalidOperationException. Before creating my own java.lang.RuntimeException subclass, I need to know if there is a similar exception type I should throw in Java. The exact scenario is: My class is a value object that provides an int intValue() method, returning an int. However, in some situations, the current value cannot be provided as an int, so this class also provides a boolean isInteger() to allow API users to know when intValue() can be safely invoked. If a caller calls intValue() when isInteger() is false, an exception should be thrown. And the question is: What type of exception? I know that this question might not have a correct answer, but considering that I don't have lots of experience designing Java APIs, I want to know from other Java developers what they would expect to be thrown in this scenario. thanks
I have an app using Wicket for the presentation layer with CDI/Weld, JPA 2.0, EJB 3.1 etc. (Java EE 6) deployed on GlassFish v3.0.1. When I try to inject an EJB into a wicket page using @EJB I get the following error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to retrieve EntityManagerFactory for unitName When I try to inject using @Inject, I get the following error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to convert ejbRef for ejb UserRepository to a business object of type class I believe the problem is stemming from JPA. I am using the exact same configuration that I used with a JSF application which worked properly, so I am lost as to what the issue could be. The connection pools are set up properly and pinging correctly through GlassFish, I have included wicket-weld on the classpath and I have even tried using the old Java EE 5 wicketstuff project for wicketstuff-javaeeapi with the same results. Any help would be appreciated.
Sorry I am new, stackoverflow does not allow me to post image and links... I try to use Official Android SDK (http://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/). I install the SDK and try to run the Example At first, it fails at "build", it cannot find the Facebook SDK, so I try to follow the steps found in SDK page: Add a dependency on the Facebook Android SDK library on your application: from the File menu, select "Properties" once the project Properties are displayed, open the Android section, which should list the build targets and libraries in the bottom "Library" section, click "Add..." and select the Facebook SDK project refer to http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#libraryProject for more details I check the link at #4, it shows a Mac OS X version Eclipse, which has Library section, but on my Vista PC, with Eclipse 3.5.2, it does not have Library section... -http://developer.android.com/images/developing/adt-props-isLib.png -http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4852346022_fc8f6bedbe_b.jpg I try to add the Facebook SDK in Java Build Path. Now it can "build" and start, on both Emulator and Device. However, once it started, it crash, the logcat shows: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(518): java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.facebook.android.Util -http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4852346048_f4a3b998a3_b.jpg) I searched around, about "NoClassDefFoundError" program, but seems those solution is solving external JARs files. I have no problem adding other JARs files, and this Facebook SDK is not JAR... I tried Clean, rebuild, delete everything and config again, but can't solve this problem yet. Anyone have idea please help, Thanks.
I currently have some C++ code that I want to compile into a shared library that I can dynamically link to a Java application during runtime using the Java Native Interface (JNI). The problem that I'm facing is - the C++ code that I'm trying to compile calls on another library itself, making use of a lot of classes and different header files. When I try to make it into a .dll file, I get a lot of linker errors (saying that I have unresolved external symbols - all of which belong to the source code that my C++ code calls from). Now I don't want to have to copy all of the external code (which is actually a library called VTK) into my own source - I just want a dynamically linkable library that has my own C++ code's functionality (which means it'd would need to be able to still recognize the external code that I don't want to duplicate). Please feel free to ask any leading questions.
I am going through the android hello world tutorial, and have been stuck when trying to create an XML UI. For some reason, even on a new program, in which I have made no changes to the default build, it gives the error java.lang.NullPointerException after every character I type. I can't figure out why it is doing this, as I am just trying to edit the text between the Text I want to set it to say something other than what is set by default. However, even with a fresh build, no changes, and I just try to change the text within the xml tags, it still gives the error. What do I need to do to allow it to let me type? I am using the eclips IDE and the android sdk. I was able to do the first part of the tutorial that doesn't involve XML.
Due to recent events, i am trying to figure out how much debugging logs i should use for code in general. What i have been doing is using debugging logs pretty sparingly, and just in cases where i wanted some extra information or what have you. This made sense to me, as it seems like you shouldn't log every little thing your code does, as that could make flood you with so much information that it would be easier to miss something that was actually important (or go crazy from digging through and verifying logs). On the other hand, i present an example: I just started using logback/slf4j for my java project, and to test that i had the .xlm file set up correctly i added a debugging log statement to the end of a method that initializes gui components. Normally i would have never put a log statement there, because it is pretty obvious if your gui components don't initialize correctly when you run the program. However this time i ran the program, and low and behold the logs showed that the gui components were being initialized twice, even though only one set of them were being displayed. A decent sized bug, but something i likely wouldn't have caught without without those debugging statements. So my question: Is there any "best practices" out there when it comes to debugging logs? I have seen many best practice questions when it comes to info logs, exceptions, errors, etc, but haven't found much out there in regards to debugging logs. Thanks :)
An application that we have recently started sporadically crashing with a message about "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: requested 8589934608 bytes for Chunk::new. Out of swap space?". I've looked around on the net, and everywhere suggestions are limited to revert to a previous version of Java fiddle with the memory settings use client instead of server mode Reverting to a previous version implies that the new Java has a bug, but I haven't seen any indication of that. The memory isn't an issue at all; the server has 32GB available, and Xmx is set to 20 while Xms is 10. I can't see the the JVM running out of the remaining 12GB (less the amount given to the handful of other processes on the machine). And we're stuck with server mode due to the nature of the application and environment. When I look at the memory and CPU usage for the application, I see constant memory usage for the whole day, but then suddenly right before it dies CPU usage goes up to 100% and the memory usage goes from X, to X + 2GB, to X + 4GB, to (sometimes) X + 8GB, to JVM death. It would appear that there is maybe cycle of repeated array resizing going on in the JIT compilation. I've now seen the error occur with the above 8GB request and also 16GB requests. All times, the method being compiled when this happens is the same. It is a simple method that has non-nested loops, no recursion, and uses methods on objects that return static member fields or instance member fields directly with little computation. So I have 2 questions: Does anybody have any suggestions? Can I test out whether there is a problem compiling this specific method on a test environment, without running the whole application, invoking the JIT compiler directly? Or should I start up the application and tell it to compile methods after a much smaller call count (like 2) to force it to compile the method almost instantly instead of at a random point in the day? @StephenC The JVM is 1.6.0_20 (previously 1.6.0_0), running on Solaris. I know it's the compilation that is causing a problem for a couple reasons. ps in the seconds leading up to it shows that a java thread with id corresponding to the compiler thread (from jstack) is taking up 100% of the CPU time jstack shows the issue is in JavaThread "CompilerThread1" daemon [_thread_in_native, id=34, ...] The method mentioned in jstack is always the same one, and is one we wrote. If you look at sample jstack output you will know what I mean, but for obvious reasons I can't provide code samples or filenames. I will say that it is a very simple method. Essentiall a handful of null checks, 2 for loops that do equality checks and possibly assign values, and some simple method calls after. All in all maybe 40 lines of code. This issue has happened 2 times in 2 weeks, though the application runs every day and is restarted daily. In addition, the application wasn't under heavy load any of these times.
The object I'm saving to the session is a LocalizationContext, which is not serializable, and my Tomcat is 5.5.28, while the qa server is Tomcat 5.5.30. This is from the Tomcat docs: Whenever Catalina is shut down normally and restarted, or when an application reload is triggered, the standard Manager implementation will attempt to serialize all currently active sessions to a disk file located via the pathname attribute. All such saved sessions will then be deserialized and activated (assuming they have not expired in the mean time) when the application reload is completed. In order to successfully restore the state of session attributes, all such attributes MUST implement the java.io.Serializable interface. You MAY cause the Manager to enforce this restriction by including the <distributable> element in your web application deployment descriptor (/WEB-INF/web.xml). This makes me think it should be breaking on my local as well, and that you can never save a session attribute in Tomcat unless it implements Serializable. EDIT: Sorry, to be more clear, my question is two-fold. Do all session attributes have to be serializable, and if they do, why might it still work on my local environment?
Recently, while working on a JSF web app, using Netbeans 6.8, I am constantly getting PermGen: Out Of Memory Errors. I have also noticed that this is not related to hot swapping the code, as some people suggested on the forums; I generally restart my local web server, Tomcat 6.0, whenever I redeploy the code. This used to happen to me once in awhile, but as of late, it was been occurring constantly. I usually can't go more than two minutes before it crashes. The important observation I've made about this problem, is that it only seems to happen when running the debugger. If I launch the server, regularly, it will run indefinitely. As soon as I run in debug mode, this problem occurs. I've tried all the tips I've found so far of increasing the JAVA_OPT memory settings for Java in Tomcat; I've tried increasing the available memory for Netbeans in netbeans.conf. Still no luck. If you want to see the specific configuration changes I've made, I can post that as well. I've also read that this can be a result of memory leaks in Java. I've tried running Netbean's profiler, but it would generally crash as well before I could do anything really useful. Additionally, when it did run, all the object allocations with ridiculous generations were things in java libraries, or primitives -- char[]s were the biggest memory hog of the app, for example, with the largest generations. I would really like to know if anyone has had a similar problem before, and if so, how they solved it. This is starting to seriously impede my ability to do my work. Thanks for any help.
So, I have the following setup in Eclipse (Java): I have a project (lets call this "project 1") which provides an interface (which is package private) I have another project ("project 2") which contains a package from project 1... Classes in this package extend the package private interfaces in "project 1" and provide a nice public interface. Now, I have "project 3" which references "project 2". Project 3 then uses the public object provided in project 2. Upon calling the constructor from project 2 in project 3, I get the following: "the type {---} cannot be resolved. it is indirectly referenced from required .class files" If I add a reference to project 1 from project 3, all is well. Is there a way to NOT have to reference project 3 in this way though? It really doesn't make sense to reference it. I'm using Eclipse (Helios) with the most recent JDK etc...
I am working on a Java application that will use some Hibernate (annotated by JPA) classes, backed by a HSQLDB datasource (DBCP BasicDataSource). I am trying to manually tweak the HSQLDB ".script" file (which I can't for the life of me find the authoritative name for by web searching/reading the docs; it's only mentioned in passing) to rapidly add some new in-memory tables for testing. The problem is, any errors that occur when HSQLDB is running this script don't seem to be reported or logged anywhere. For instance, if I have an INSERT statement within that .script (a very common usage scenario to set up an initial dataset), and there is a problem with it (like incorrect date format, incorrect number of columns, etc.), nothing is ever reported, and there is no exception. I only notice later on when the HQL query I construct in the test case throws an exception due to a NULL result, which the program is not expecting since the data set should be initialized properly at that point. The only reason I even figured out there was a problem with the INSERT statement was by performing them on a raw SQLConnection on the HSQLDB datasource, rather than doing them in the .script file, and observing the SQLExceptions that were thrown at that point. Logging in general seems to be working and HSQLDB is logging tons of other messages of all thresholds very frequently during startup to stdout. So I'm flummoxed as to why those don't include obvious SQLExceptions that must be getting thrown at some point. Any ideas on what to try? Some configuration I'm missing, perhaps? I tried searching all through the HSQLDB docs to no avail, but that doesn't necessarily mean the answer isn't there. In case it matters, the usage scenario I'm trying to get this working for is a Spring application context initialized within a JUnit test case (via a FileSystemXmlApplicationContext object). Thanks for any help.
This question is something like a holy grail of project environment setting. Here goes a rationale: Big projects tends to have poor documentation so there are a lot of trial-and-error cycles. Therefore I often use the reload-without-redeploy feature of some libraries (facelets, webflow, tapestry, jrebel...). The easiest way to use such feature is to have the same structure in VCS as is in servlet container and point servlet container directly to the development directory. However big projects are also often divided into some kind of modules to avoid too much complexity. This means that directory structure is very different in VCS and in the web container. Right now I even have a situation where I have two projects sharing the same core project which I need to develop simultaneously. If the project is small enough, I'm using incremental building with ant that is run by Eclipse on save of any file. But if there are several thousands of files where timestamp needs to be compared or some other time consuming action is run, than even incremental build can be quite annoying. The only thing that would make incremental builds faster (and therefore makes development MUCH MORE enjoyable) is some kind of IDE save action hooks that would supply ant more information about what is saved so that ant can avoid unnecessary work. If you have ever though about this, please share your thoughts with me - your favorite project setting, IDE tips, trial-and-error strategy criticism, whatever. For example I recently noticed the new "Web Deployment Assembly" feature, but I don't know how it can be used to make deployment dir structure synchronized with development dir structure during DEVELOPMENT, not build. Thanks
Hey everyone, I'm a beginner, so I'll try my best to explain this problem succinctly. Basically, a friend of mine and I were playing around with the Android SDK, editing a simple RSS reader. We could launch it in the emulator and even install it on our real devices. Fast forward a few days, I'm trying to import the exact same code that was working a few days earlier into Eclipse on my laptop. I tried both importing and new project from existing source. Both return these new errors that we never had originally. I got an error that involved the auto generated "R" file, but I have solved this. Now, I'm getting 3 errors that I have never had before - The method onClick(View) of type new View.OnClickListener(){} must override a superclass method - displayed twice ( 2 different lines) The method onTabChanged(String) of type new TabHost.OnTabChangeListener(){} must override a superclass method My question is this - What would cause the these discrepancies between importing/running on my friends computer and mine? Also, we are both using the latest version of Java/Eclipse Thanks in advance for any insight.

Any thoughts on that? I can add the rest of the sources if needed. Apache Tomcat log does not contain any errors. Thanks for any help.
I'm currently writing a JNI project where I'm getting the following error log when trying to run my Java code. It tells me that the problematic frame is a jvm.dll one, and in trying to isolate the problem, I'm trying to work out where exactly my problem is (in the JVM vs. my native code) I've attached the thread section of the log, and can append the rest if needed. I also tried reinstalling the JVM.

Enviroment: JSF 2.0, RichFaces 3.3.3, Facelets 1.1.15B1, Spring Framework 3.x, WebFlow 2.1, MyBatis 3.0.1, Oracle 10/11 g backend, SLF4j into Log4j. Well thats probably TMI since my issue is only a logging problem but better to be too thorough than not. Anyways... I just setup SLF4j & log4j so now all of the internal facelets log msgs are being dumped into log4j & I can actually see them. In addition I setup Tomcat to also dump to log4j instead of it's custom version of JULI. Upon doing this everything appeared to be working great.... until i shut down the app. Midway through the shutdown process my app started barfing up errors left 'n right because (which makes sense) Tomcat is trying to grab a logger instance AFTER spring has already cleaned up the logger bean. Anyone familiar with this? I imagine it must be a common problem for anyone who has Tomcat using the non-standard logging mechanism. What is the best way around this? I thought maybe if I just raised the log level then Tomcat wouldn't even try to log msgs because of the level req.s but the problem occurs when tomcat is trying to retrieve a logger instance so that didn't work.
I have a client/server question that i am trying to figure out the best solution for. If a client ever gets disconnected from the server, for any reason, i would like a way for the input output thread to alert the gui thread that something went wrong, and thus have the gui thread print an error and gracefully handle it (probably drop back out to the login gui). After the initial gui thread is created, the client could change to any number of guis, depending on what he is doing, so I am thinking i need a way to dynamically see what gui is currently being run. The way that i was thinking of doing this so far: 1) Create an object that creates and shows every gui. So instead of calling invokeLater...SomeGui.CreateAndShoGui()... we would have this object be responsible for doing that, ie GuiObject.showSomeGui(); 2) Have each gui implement an interface, which will insure there is a method that, when called, will gracefully shutdown this gui when we have lost connection to the server. 3) Have a thread that monitors the IO thread and the gui object. If something goes wrong on the IO thread, the IO thread will close down and notify the monitoring thread that we have lost connection the server. The monitoring thread could then alert any open guis (from the gui object) that we have lost connection and that it needs to shut down. I have just started thinking about this, and so far this is the best solution i have come up with. Does this seem like a reasonable solution that wont add too much complexity to the code? Or can anyone recommend a solution that would be simpler for people reading the code to understand? Thanks EDIT: The other option i am toying with is having an object on the IO thread, that also gets passed to each new gui as it is opened. This object will give the currently opened guis reference back to the io thread, so that the io thread can alert it if something goes wrong. I am leaning against this solution though, because it seems like it would be easier to read if you had one object that was dedicated to get this working (like the above solution), instead of passing some obscure object to each gui.
I have written a RIA using flex for the front-end and Java servlet for the back end which actually makes calls to a web-service to do some processing. The welcome page is a html page which is served from the web-logic 8.1 server that the app is hosted on. The welcome page loads and the flash content loads. Even a 'xml' file containing some configuration properties gets loaded from the server (through URL Request). Now when I click a button on the page, it would authenticate the user, by sending the data to the servlet. Here's the problem... The servlet doesn't get invoked and the URL Request (for the servlet with appropriate parameters) returns a 500: Internal Server Error page. The same code is working perfectly when I deploy it on my local machine using tomcat as a server. And I have also checked umpteen times if the host URL is correct when being deployed on the web-logic server. Even checked the URL when the request is being made, in firefox, using firebug, and all seems to be fine, except that the response is '500: Internal Server Error'. Please help. Thanks in Advance.
I am from Bangalore-India. I have developed few J2ME applications that involves client/server interaction through HTTP connection. I am testing my application on both the leading operators of the country- Airtel and Vodafone. My Midlet works fine with S60rd edition and S40 2nd edition(6030) phone. but as soon as i switch to S40 3rd edition phones like 6233, I am not able to acces the GPRS through my MIDLET. Though the GPRS is working fine with the native phone browser. Even the MIDLET is not able to access GPRS on currently released phones such as 5310 Xpress Music and 3110 classic. I have done some packet captures as weel at my server end but the observation is that my request is not reaching upto the server. I have gone through tons of web references that talk abt APN settings, but no solution has worked for me :( Is there anyone who can help me out so solve this S40 specific problem. Thanks in advance.
We have to create a web service client using Apache CXF in Java. The thing is I cannot seem to get the SSL session to properly engage. Either it fails altogether, the server fails to decipher what is sent to it once the application data is transmitted or I fail to read the responses from the server. However when trying the same transaction using a simple soap test client built in .NET everything runs smoothly. Server is using double authentication. Everything is certificate based (x509) stored in the windows certificate store (windows-MY and windows-ROOT) edit yes, double authentication is indeed client AND server authentication. Thus far using the bountyCastle provider instead of SunMSCAPI seems to get further but still cannot get the client authentication to work. PLatform of client CXF 2.2.9, Sun JDK 1.6_21 server IIS 6 ASP.NET unfortunately is all I could gather, I have no control over the server and must use it as-is. update I am using a JKS keystore now but still am getting the problem. It seems the client is not sending his certificate to the server as part of the authentication process. As a result I get a 403.7 error from the server. Funny thing is that I receive this error message as an HTML page that must first be decrypted before it is readable !
I have about 400 unit tests that I have written for my Android application. If I run the tests package by package, everything works fine and all my tests pass. However, if I try to run them all at once, eventually (about 360 tests in), Android starts spitting out !!! Failed Binder Transaction Errors !!!. After about 10-20 of these errors, the process for the application I am testing gets killed and the unit tests never even complete. I should note that during this time Eclipse reports Collecting test information in the Console. I think that is odd because it shows that it is running tests even though the JUnit UI doesn't reflect that. When everything works properly, during the Collecting test information phase I see the tests run, the JUnit UI then comes up, and then all the tests are run again (I know this by reading logcat). That is (I think) a separate issue, but I felt I would mention it if anybody knew what that was about. Edit as of June 6th 2011 As per Christopher's answer below, I have verified that this only happens when attempting to run this through Eclipse. If i run my test suite using ANT, all the tests finally execute. When I attempt to run my test suite now, Eclipse essentially hangs on "collecting test information". I haven't let it run for an extended period of time, but I will give that a try as soon as I can to see if it ever completes.
first of all, I am not very familiar with Tibco, please keep that in mind ;). I have a task to write an application which reads/writes to a jms queue (not a big deal). The problem is, the customer uses Tibco & allowed me to connect to their server to run some tests. Unfortunatly, I am only allowed to connect via natted IPs & as soon as I try to connect to a QueueConnectionFactory, I receive an error because Tibco itself tries to connect to the "private" IP. The interesting thing is, receiving the Queue, QueueConnectionFactory,... objects from the context works fine - but when I do a toString() I see that the cf received has configured the 'private' IP. Example: I set this url as provider url -> tibjmsnaming://213.133.111.182:7222 Receiving the QueueConnectionFactory object works fine, doing a to string returns "QueueConnectionFactory[URL=tcp://145.12.51.4:7222;clientID=null]" So as soon as I call "createQueueConnectionFactory()" I receive this exception: javax.jms.JMSException: Failed to connect to the server at tcp://145.12.51.4:7222 Is there a way to override this behavior & tell the Tibco server to use the configured provider url instead?
I've been trying to diagnose a memory leak in an Android application I'm writing. I got a heap dump loaded into Eclipse, but the results I'm seeing are very curious. There are some 20,000 instances of an exception (specifically, LDAPException from the UnboundID LDAP library) in the heap with no inbound references. That is, they show up at the root of the dominator tree. The OQL SELECT objects e FROM com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.LDAPException e WHERE (inbounds(e).length = 0) returns over 20,000 results, totalling to nearly all of the heap. And yet, the GC runs before the heap dump and I can see that it's running in the console, repeatedly, during the execution of the leaky code. If these instances have no inbound refs, what could be keeping them alive? I also tried doing a "shortest paths to GC" query. It shows one LDAPConnectionReader row retaining 2 instances, and ~20k LDAPException @ <addr> unknown rows with various hex addresses. Update: I haven't had time to further diagnose this since posting it, and the bounty I posted is ending before I likely will. I'm awarding it as best I can now, lest the points go to waste. Thanks to everyone who looked into this! I will come back later and update again with the results of further diagnosis, when life is a little less hectic.
In Swing, the GUI is supposed to be updated by the EDT only, since the GUI components are not thread safe. My question is, if I have a single thread, other than the EDT, that is dedicated to update a specific component, and this component is not accessed by any other thread in my program, only this dedicated thread, is it ok? In my case I have a JTable and a thread receives information from the network and updates the table (without using EventQueue.invokeLater). All the other components are updated from the EDT. I have not seen a problem so far, and I was wondering if a bug will surface eventually. UPDATE My purpose was to update the table in real-time. The data come constantly from the network and for this I dedicated 1 thread just for the table, to update it constanlty as they come. If I use the SwingUtilities.invokeLater, this means that the table will be updated when the EDT is available. Is not swing supposed to be used for real-time update requirements?
I'm trying to follow along with the examples in the book "JBoss Drools Business Rules" (which, like most other Packt Publishing books, is a poorly edited mess of misspellings, bad edits, and errors). The Drools UI has advanced a bit since this book was written, so I can't follow along exactly. I've uploaded a model as a jar file, and now want to define some rules. I navigate to packages->models and find my model Then, on the left hand side, I say "create new->New Rule->Business Rule (guided editor)" I create the rule, then try to modify the "when" condition, and I get that error Note: No model has been defined. Tip: You will want to import or define a model for this user interface to work ! and since it doesn't know about the model, this guided interface doesn't really do much good. Does anyone out there know how this is supposed to work?
currently we're running quite a few applications on our WebSphere Portal Server, and most of the have their own log-file, so the System.out won't be too overloaded. However, once an error happens in an application it's easy to miss. If an errors is logged, I would like to get a warning in the System.out with a notice to take a look at the related log-file. For now I did this by wrapping the log4j logger into a class with equal methods to the logger-class, and it just delegates all calls to the logger. only when the error- and fatal-messages methods are called, the file to log at is retrieved from the logger, and a warning is written to the System.out. This is working fine, except that now the LoggerWrapper is the caller to the logger-methods, und thus is written to the log files as the caller, not the original caller. Is there any way around this, maybe even with a completely different approach? I would like to avoid having to rewrite all exception-handlers to add the message to the System.out themselves.

So I have a maven module (module-A) in IntelliJ. I recently moved some classes from it into another new maven module (module-B) and added a dependency to it. Once I had done this I also modified the signature of a method of one of the moved classes (now in module-B). I re-imported the poms so that IntelliJ would pick up the dependency changes and ensured all Java imports for the affected files were correct again. Now when I attempt to run my webapp (which depends on the two modules) I get a compile error in a class in module-A calling the modified method of the class in module-B. The error message is basically saying that that method doesn't exist but believes the old method still exists! I click on the 'make' error and it takes me to the line in a class in module-A calling the modified method...the weird thing is, IntelliJ knows it is fine in the file. i.e. The method is not underlined in red like a compile error would normally be, but the class file name is :( I compiled it from the command line using 'mvn install' (having also installed module-B) and it is all successful. I have deleted the classes directory in the target of both module-A and module-B and also invalidated IntelliJ's caches and restarted...still happening...any ideas?
Is there any way to prevent the "The application's digital signature cannot be verified" warning message from appearing when you run a Java application from the command line? I'm looking for a command line solution that would allow to start an application like this on a continuous integration server, so I need a solution that would not require manual intervention. Also, I would prefer not to disable this warning for any application because this could be a security risk. Not sure if helps but I do know the values of "name", "publisher" and "from" fields of the signature. Just be sure, I'm not asking about how to sign this application. update 1 I suppose that the solution is to use keytool to import the certificate from the command line but for some reason it does fail to import it properly because it does not appear in control panel applet after this and the application still requires it. keytool -importcert -file my.cer -alias alf2 -storepass changeme -noprompt Is it something related to the the default keystore, how can I assure I'm importing into the right keystore? update 2 After lot of research on the net I made some progress, worked at least on Windows 7 with Java 6: keytool -importcert -file my.cer -keystore "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Sun\Java\Deployment\security\trusted.certs" -storepass "" -noprompt -v I looks that Sun failed to specify in the documentation the real location of the default keystore and the fact that the default password is blank. But this is not the end, because when this run on the automation user account it failed, it failed because this user did not had an keystore yet and because the command line tool keytool is not able to create a keystore with an empty password, requesting at least 6 characters. see Sun's forum tread...
"Table 1" can have multiple instances of "Table 2". "Table 2" is one to one mapped with "Table A". But the instance for "Table A" is created by "Table B". "Table 1" need not always have an entry of "Table 2". Table 2 has two columns say tb1 and tbA. tb1 references to primary key of "Table 1" and tbA to that of "Table A". If the data for Table A is saved first and then the data for Table 1 then it works fine. But if I am saving saving the content of Table 1 which has a mapping to Table 2 entry and Table A entry is not saved yet, I am getting a TransientObjectException. I am using hibernate and annotations in JAVA. I have tried the cascade associations and every other possible solutions that I could find in the web. But of no use. Please do throw in some ideas. Example : Consider Table 1 = Person; Table 2 = Belonging; Table A = Car; Table B = Manufacturer. Person can have many Car. Car has the person_id (refering the Person) and car_id (the Car). A Car should definitely have a manufacturer. Now in my application, a Person will be associated with a car which is created by the Manufacturer but not saved (i.e. car_id not yet generated). Now when I save the session data as a whole (that is how it can be done in my case) i want the car data to be saved first followed by the Person data bcos then the TransientObjectException will not occur. Any suggestions on how to accomplish this. Hope the example is better.
I'm fairly new to java/eclipse development and I'm having a bit of a problem debugging code from a specific jar in a web app that my company uses. First off, I have Tomcat setup properly and can run the webapp successfully (other than the bug that I'm trying to find!). There are about two dozen jar files in the lib directory for the webapp, and when I've tried to debug files in other jars the debugger catches their breakpoints correctly and everything is happy. Breakpoints I set in code in the new jar are skipped, and when I catch a breakpoint further along the debug stack any attempt to click to the class I'm interested in results in "Source not found". I click the "Edit Source Lookup Path..." button, click the project that contains the code, and it simply returns me to the "Source not found" error. I've tried setting up the lookup path both as a project as well as a File System Directory and a Workspace Project. Same result every time. I'm a little fuzzy on how exactly the debugger ties a particular function call in the debug stack window to source code - is it simply based on the package and class name of the course file? If so, I can't see why it wouldn't be working. Any ideas?
I don't really know where to start with this issue, so I'll just say what's wrong: I'm running some code in Eclipse that is connecting to our remote "dev" server and presumably using the server there. This means that when I update code in the servlet or any code that actually uses the servlet, no changes are reflected on my local machine. My question is how can I run the servlet on my local machine and have it connect to the dev server to use its MySQL DB to get the data. Presumably this will allow me to make changes to the servlet locally and still use test data. I am running Tomcat 5.5 as well, and in Debug Configurations I tell the servlet to run on localhost:8000, but it says it can't connect. I'm really stuck here and it's disheartening since any changes I make to the code aren't even reflected at all. Moreover I can't see any debug information to tell if my changes are even working at all much less how I intend. I also tried to make some noticeable changes to parts of the code so that it would be easy to see that I'm affecting it and it doesn't look like they're actually having an effect when I run the code. tl;dr I'm stupid and don't know what to do.
How can a Java program find out if it is running in debug mode? The application should behave a bit different in regular “full speed” mode than in “debug mode” (when a debugger is attached, when running in debug mode). The application communicates over TCP with either another computer, another process, or within itself. My co-worker wants us to use Socket.setSoTimeout(1000) by default, so that reads from the socket can block for at most 1 second. When debugging, this is not enough of course, and the application stops working as it should. So a solution would be to set the SO_TIMEOUT higher, but just in debug mode (for example: unlimited). Now, I don't always set breakpoints or don't want use a debug build where I could set the “debug” property myself. Sometimes I attach the debugger (remote debugging). I'm mainly using Eclipse so a solution that just works there is OK. Possible answers include: To find out if run in debug mode, use the following method in java.lang.management.* or javax.management.* ... Your co-worker is wrong for reason X, you shouldn't set SO_TIMEOUT to 1 second by default. Update I know about the system property approach, but I leave the question open to solve my original question.
I have a Java client - server application. The client is designed to run arbitrary user code. If the user code running on the client creates an OutOfMemoryError then the client ends up in an ugly state. Normally the client would be sending messages (via RMI) to the server until the code the client is running terminates and the client gracefully disconnects with the server. What would people recommend for the OOM situation on the client? Could I catch it and kill the client process? Presumably I would not be able to push any commands out from the server because the client will be unresponsive. If possible, I would like the client process to be terminated without having to log on to the client machine and kill it "by hand". Clearly it would be best if the user code did not cause this error in the first place, but that is up to the user to debug and my framework to deal with in as friendly way as possible. Thanks for your ideas!
I'm in the dark as to how to even attack this particular problem and I have very little information to work with. Please bear with me. My current project (a trading application) runs fine from Netbeans 6.9, and the build actually runs fine.. at first.. with `java -jar "my project.jar". It is a Swing application and everything comes up nicely. There are no error message in the terminal window. However, when I engage the trading program itself (setting some of the threads into a more active state by clicking a command button), nothing happens. No error messages in the terminal, and none of the usual messages in the application. Like I said, it works fine from within Netbeans. Also, I've written other programs before using the same trading API (Interactive Brokers) and Swing, and haven't had this problem. How do I even begin troubleshooting this problem? I am admittedly build-stupid, meaning I have no idea how builds work and therefore no idea how to check if it is building properly. I've checked /dist/lib and verified all of the libraries are present. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
I'm trying to secure my application by running the bits of code that deal with user-provided content under a very restrictive SecurityManager. It's AccessController.doPrivileged() turned on its head - normally this is used to provide a block of code with extra permissions but I'm using it to constrain a block of code to a very small sandbox. Everything is fine until I need to call a constructor. Then I need read-access to the world. (Or at least to all of the .jar, .class and .property files on my classpath.) I can't just grant read access to <> since that's what I'm trying to avoid. (E.g., an XEE attack that tries to read /etc/passwd.) I don't think that would be enough anyway. I can move some of the constructors out of the SecurityManager block, but some are unavoidable since it's a SAX parser that needs to create objects as it goes through the tree. Ideas?
I am new to eclipse and java. The way I understand the directory structure is that you have source packages in src/ folder and they are built into the /build folder. It was all working fine until recently. But today I tried debugging after creating a new class and it was throwing ClassNotFoundException when I do F11. On investigation, I found that it was using older versions of even the existing classes and not the new builds, and there was no .class file corresponding to my new class. I checked the build/ directory and it seems the builds are also old as it is showing yesterdays last modified time despite the fact that I have made changes today and tried to debug it. This problem is not limited to debugging as I exported the class into a jar file and it is still using yesterday's jar file. What could be the issue here? Is it not 'building' the classes? Have I messed up the default 'build' folder somewhere?

GSON on Google App Engine throws a Security Exception Reflection Permission problems when using the GSON library in a applet But neither of them had an answer for me. One just said to not use Gson. Is there any way to grant Reflection permission to my applet? Update: I'm in the process of switching my application to use JNLP file and Java Web Start because I haven't been able to figure out how to make the Applet work. I'll leave this question open in case anybody figures it out, but using a JNLP may be the only option if you don't want to give up Gson.
I have a problem with signing my jar files with jarsigner. I used this tutorial to sign my jar files, but with the last step(signing the jar), I got this error: jarsigner error: java.lang.RuntimeException: keystore load: Invalid keystore format and I didn't use step #10, I used instead step #5 from this site since, I'm using a real certificate not a fake one ... Note: I'm having my certificate in .spc & .pvk format... But, since I'm using jarsigner, I have to convert them to .p12 format. So, I convert them first to .pfx using pvkimprt.exe then to .p12. I used the method that I specified in the link that I mentioned it before. Also, I tried to create a fake certificate to make sure that the problem is not from the pvkimprt.exe tool or from the certificate. It gave me the same error. The certificate is just fine. So, where is the problem came from?
I have a Java server process which does heavy processing. It intermittently stops processing, as in the log stops, and activity ceases but the process is still active. I have had this happen while debugging a few times. When it does I hit pause/break in the debugger so I can inspect the running threads and look for the cause of the stop. But the pause button doesn't break into the program like it normally does, just sits there. I use IntelliJ IDEA but I'm not sure if it will be the IDE or the JVM that is having the issue. I try breaking into the program before the issue occurs and it works fine, process stops and I can check through the list of threads. Does anyone know why a JVM would not respond to a debugging pause/break? And how it might get into that situation? I'm a bit stuck as I have no way of diagnosing this issue without being able to see the program state when it is broken. The logs leading up to the issue show no problems.
I am using tomcat5.0.28 windows installer , and it stopped in the middle of progress bar. with the last message "using jvm: c:\java\j2sdk1.4.2_19\" i wait for a long time, and it seems freeze, i have to kill the process. I use process explorer to check the processes. i found a children process created by tomcat installer, i checked the property of this process, and found the command line is: C:\TEMP\nse305.tmp\ns306.tmp "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat5.0\bin\tomcat5.exe" //IS//Tomcat5 --DisplayName "Apache Tomcat" --Description "Apache Tomcat 5.0 Server -http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/" --LogPath "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.0\logs" --Install "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.0\bin\tomcat5.exe" --Jvm "$2"' i copied this long command line, and try to run it in cmd windows, it show some tomcat install service message, then it freeze, the process does not return at all. i think that is the problem, this children process does not return , which blocked the tomcat installation. i downloaded the tomcat5.0.28 sourcecode and go to tomcat5.nsi file.(the install script file), and found it is trying to run this : nsExec::ExecToLog '"$INSTDIR\bin\tomcat5.exe" //IS//Tomcat5 --DisplayName "Apache Tomcat" --Description "Apache Tomcat @VERSION@ Server - http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/" --LogPath "$INSTDIR\logs" --Install "$INSTDIR\bin\tomcat5.exe" --Jvm "$2"' looks like the installer use nsExec, a library to run the command . i found C:\TEMP\nse305.tmp\ns306.tmp, and in the same folder, there is also a nsExec.dll file. i compared the ns306.tmp with nsExec.dll. there is a little difference between them, only several byte, and 99% is same, so i think this tmp file is actually a variant of nsExec.dll. i guess the nsis engine created this temp folder and temp file, and use it to run the command line, i am not clear how NSIS engine and NsExec do their job, but i think they don't work well this time in my pc, maybe it's my pc's problem. but why this process never return? can anybody give me any clue ? (i also tried to run tomcat6.0 installer, it works well, no problem)
I'm currently in a class on systems software development. We are writing the two-pass assembler for the assembly language of a fictional machine. We've implemented the tokenizer, and all of the classes that we need to abstractedly represent this program - all that is left (besides implementing the code generator in a later phase) is to parse the tokens. Here is where I'm having a major issue. I'm choosing to implement this as a recursive descent parser, since that's the only technique I currently have experience with...but we are not allowed to stop assembly on syntax errors. For instance, if the user gives a load word instruction with invalid syntax, we are to replace it with a NOP. If the user gives a bad label, we are to simply ignore it. If the user places unknown characters in a line, we discard them. On the one hand, it sounds easy - however, implementing this causes me to break (what I understand to be) one of the important rules of a recursive descent parser. Each of my functions pulls multiple tokens before calling another function, since I need to account for all of the possible fixable syntax errors. Given that I can't stop assembly, and I must have enough information about my current context to intelligently determine what the user was intending to do, I have to handle a lot within one function. This turns the program from a true recursive descent parser into more of a semi-finite-state-machine. I feel like I'm doing this badly, but I'm not sure how else to implement this. Does anyone have any suggestions/ideas? BTW - I'm not allowed to use tools like ANTLR, or any other parser generator. Thanks.
I've turned on USB debugging. I have the latest HTC Sync and android SDK components. I'm using Eclipse 3.5 on windows XP. I'm running Android 2.2, and am asking for 2.1 as the minimum in the debugger. I work in Eclipse/Java just about every day, and have for several years. I'm even writing an Eclipse plugin at work as I type this.... neither Eclipse nor Java are new to me by quite a stretch. When I start a debug session for the "Skeleton App" sample project, I can see my Evo, and the activity launches (with any freshly saved changes), should I select it. BUT: my breakpoints are ignored, and logCat doesn't see my app's output(see comments below). *W*hat a *T*errible *F*ailure (As the api so artfully puts it)! (oh look... a formatting bug. Looks like bold text wants white space to function properly 10/15/2010) I have tried different android connection types (charge only, disk drive, HTC Sync, and USB tethering) to no avail. I've tried Eclipse 3.6 for a bit before yielding to the inevitable and reinstalling 3.5. I monkeyed with the emulator for a while but ran into a different set of issues (I had to reboot the emulator every time I wanted to make a change... Eclipse's auto-build/hot-swap has me spoiled). Is there something I can add to (or remove from) the AndroidManifest.XML to deal with this? A magical incantation perhaps? Must I pray towards San Jose three times a day on a rug woven from kernel gurus' vast and scruffy beards? Is my Evo not Kosher? Must I be "sky clad" while debugging? Shall I teach my laptop to genuflect?
I'm attempting to compile javabot on windows using maven 2. I've compiled java programs in the past ( so I know the default JDK is working correctly), and this is my first time using maven. The error I'm getting is: [INFO] Compilation failure \evanchooly-javabot-dbea131\apt-tools\src\main\java\javabot\maven\Indexer.java:[23,37] package com.sun.tools.javac.processing does not exist error: Bad service configuration file, or exception thrown while constructing Processor object: javax.annotation.processing.Processor: Provider javabot.maven.Indexer not found I (think) I've correctly set all the environment variables correctly, as directed to on the maven download page, as well as having upgraded to Java 1.6.0_22, and still the same errors. I've contacted other people, who've told me that maven is able to compile the program correctly on OSX and Linux without any problems. Could someone give me clear instructions of what would need to be done to compile javabot on windows using maven? Thanks. (I'm running windows XP, 32 bit)
I work on a UI java application composed from: top header left menu header text error message (displayed on the page's header) center container (JPanel) which is changed dinamically, in dependence of selected menu item (from left side) When there are any computation errors, an error message is displayed on the application's header (location in the page's header).Error messages can be different, ones are composed from one row, but others are longer (2,3 rows) When a long error appears, it may be displayed correctly or not (the message is displayed over other components). As far as I know, on changing UI components the doLayout(), repaint() methods are invoked indepenendly and these should correct the layout. Recently I read about EDT and noticed that a swing application should be organised according to EDT principles. I think that this will solve my problem, because all the operations will be synchronized and I'll manage the method calls' consecutivity. But now, I don't have enough time to refactor the application and this is scheduled for next release. Do you know another solution which will help in adjusting layouts? This problem is very tricky, I'm not able to reproduce it. But it appears from time to time. Thanks a lot. Sergiu PS: If you have any questions or more details are needed, please don't hesitate to contact me.
I have some pretty boilerplate Java code that does a while loop with a tg.getParent() to get the root thread group. This has been working for several months on four different environments (one Windows and three Linux). Recently we added a fifth environment for our Accessment Validation testing. This environment is supposed to be a replica of our production environment as much as possible. The developers have very limited access to this system, and it's been a multi-week process getting the system set up by our hosting group to have all the correct permissions and properties. Just about everything is now working, however today, when the tester went to the part of the application that exercises the getRootThreadGroup() method mentioned above, the call to ThreadGroup.getParent() apparently threw a SecurityException. I don't have a lot of details because at the moment I haven't been able to locate the application log file. But I am 99.99% sure that a SecurityException occurred here. I've looked at the javadoc for SecurityException and getParent() and checkAccess(), etc, but none of it is making a lot of sense to me. Can anyone think of a simple reason why this new environment would cause our application to throw a SecurityException on this call when this has never been observed on any other environments (and the code definitely gets executed without exception on all the other environments)? My gut feeling is that somehow the runtime user for the application doesn't have permissions to "something" ... Oh, it's running on a Bea Weblogic server with java 1.6 (jrockit-jdk), but it should be configured exactly the same as the other environments. Thanks for any help.

I'm writing a game for Android. When the user completes a level, they can restart from the next level if they lose (i.e. I need to store an integer to remember which level they got to). If the app is interrupted during play, I save the world state to disk (this is complex state storing a map and game entities). I'd like to keep my options open in the future for changing my game code and the way the world state is saved/stored. However, I must consider the scenario when a user has an old version of the world state on their phone because they were in the middle of a game, they upgrade the app and now the app cannot load the world state. Having to write code to migrate the old version of the data to the new version of the data would be a pain if there's some way I can avoid this. It would be nice if I could somehow ask the user to finish their current game in progress before updating. Can this be done? Are there any other options? I don't intend to do this often. I'd like to iteratively develop my game while getting some early feedback, but this is difficult if I must fix how the world state is saved and restored now. I hope this doesn't seem a silly question, but on a PC or a console it's perfectly OK to have games that you cannot save during a game or you can only save between levels. I'm just finding Android a bit of a pain here as you must have a save game strategy for all games.
Assuming I have one Connection per JVM (implemented as a singleton) as a derivative of the docs which recommend having one Connection as it's a heavy object. From the docs: ... a connection is a relatively heavyweight object. Most clients will do all their messaging with a single connection... A JMS client typically creates a connection, one or more sessions, and a number of message producers and consumers. I'm trying to decide what to do with my Sessions, Producers and Consumers with respect to the ExceptionListener which is at the Connection level. To the best of my understanding it is very reasonable they are no longer usable, when a JMSException is thrown, but I'm not sure what should be done once the above listener is triggered. My Sessions are kept in a ThreadLocal<Session> which is also kept in a singleton. I can use this to call MySessionSingleton.closeSession() in the listener but this will only close the Session which is bound to the thread in which the Exception was thrown and not all other Sessions. In addition this does not take care of the Producers\Consumers and their reconnect. A possible solution which I saw used and I'm reluctant to imitate is to have a Connection and a Session for every Producer\Consumer and so I can control all of the above. Would appreciate any thoughts, Ittai Clarification: My current implementation, by a former programmer, is the one I refer to above as being used and the biggest problem it poses for me is that I need several producers and consumers to use the same Session as I have a need for JTA transactions and I think (might be wrong) that I need those Producers\Consumers to share the session. The connection was a derivative of that decision. So basically even if I keep the relationship of one session per connection I still have the above problem when one session has multiple Producers\Consumers.
I have been searching all over the Internet, but I can't find a way to get the RMI code to behave the way I want (like an RPC call). Java: 1.5 I am trying to set up a client/server RMI call - the client should call the "square()" method on the server, the server squares the number that's passed, and returns it. During the process of building this, I put a log4j statement on the server method. When I try to run the client from the command line, I look up the name in the RMI registry, execute the square() method on the local instance, and get a "NoClassDefFoundError" for log4j on the client as it attempts to run the square() method. What this is telling me is that the client is attempting to download not only the interface, but the implementation of the server logic as well. Which, for the situation I'm in, is not what I want. I've looked and looked, and I can't find an obvious answer for how I should get the system to run the methods remotely, like an RPC call.

Assume a distributed communication system where client and server communicate via a stateless channel. The client sends requests to the server and the server does processing and keeps internal records for each client. Server sends back notifications to the clients as various events happen to the system, as needed. The notification mechanism depends on the internal records. My question is, what is the standard appoach in distributed computing to handle the client failures? I.e. in this context, assume that the client process crashes or simply restarts. The server still has the records for the client but now client and server are of sync. As a result client will get notifications according to records created before restart. This is undesirable. What is a standardized way to detect the client failures? E.g. client has restarted and previous records must be erased? I thought of periodic callbacks to clients and if a client is not reachable, erase its records but I am not sure if this is a good idea. [EDIT] I thought of callbacks because, the period events send back to the client can be in very large intervals and so the client failure would not be noticable soon Can anyone help on this? The context of my application domain is web services. Thank you!
I am trying to teach my self hibernate with a net-beans tutorial. Here are one link, but I tried several, using same sample database: (so far I am only allowed one hyperlink ;0 ) http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/web/hibernate-webapp.html I would have thought Netbeans makes it simple, but the creation of pojos / mapping files always fails! I do create cfg.xml + reveng.xml, but when trying to create mapping files, i can choose my tables in the wizard, add them, but after clicking finish the IDE does not create anything !! (plus: I am not able to click next, only finish ! / as some tutorial asks u to click next) Now I really wonder what could be the cause, I would appreciate any help. I checked NetBeans mailing / bug list - there solutions did not work for me. I am using NB 6.9.1 - (currently downloading newest hibernate libraries / zip file, but not even sure what to do with them when done) Thanks for any help / advice - I had found one question on stackoverflow, but there was no real solution given !! Best Regards Alexis
We recently saw this error. Server sent a response message (MSG1) to one of its clients (size of msg > 64KB). Something happened at the client's read, this message was not received at all. Neither the SocketTimeOutException nor the IOException were thrown. Server tried to send another message (MSG2) but was blocked in its write (the buffers at the TCP/IP level could have been full with MSG1). 2 hours elapsed before we realised this and had to restart everything. We managed to simulate the same thing by making client read slower (by pausing for 2s) and making the server send similar messages (size >64KB) as usual. In the first place, we could see no reason why the client would read slowly, for months it has been able to cope with such messages without the problem. I would like to know (a) what causes this kind of deadlock say if the client's read getInputStream().read(byBuf) is slower than the server's write getOutputStream().write(MSG1) (byBuf is a Byte buffer of size 512Bytes) (b) Could a socket error or n/w error cause such blockage otherwise? We are using jdk 1.6.0. Many thanks!

How can it be that Netbeans can compile and run apps, but that the path environmental variable for windows xp doesn't have javac configures correctly (assuming this to be the problem, see GAE error)? Following this tutorial, I'm getting runtime errors from a Java app. I'm using NB 6.9.1 and the GAE (Google App Engine) third-party for the correct version. I suppose I could compile the plugin from source, but I don't believe that's the problem. As near as I can tell the Guestbook app comes directly from Google for GAE. ------------update----------------- OK, this looks like a path problem. The output from path shows that not all drives have the correct path. (I manually added the JDK path to the path for the c drive.) The spammy output for the GAE is seperated, as is the spammy run output. I think it's just the network mapping, which is breaking the path(?).
I have an Eclipse project which is built using Maven, and I'm using the m2eclipse plugin inside Eclipse for it's Maven support. However this project also contains a build.xml which is not used for actually building the project, but just for scripting capabilities as a utility for developers on the project - it is not used in building or packaging the product (just helping to automate some side tasks the developers often have to invoke on the side). Whenever this file is opened in an editor in Eclipse, Eclipse notices what it thinks is a problem with some missing declarations in the build.xml and begins to display errors for the project (in the Problems view) along with a red X icon/marker for the project to show that there are build errors. These aren't even true problems with the build.xml, just some problems that Eclipse thinks are present because it is not able to import all of the other dependent files this build.xml is using. There are no "build" errors with the project, just errors in what Eclipse (in it's infinite wisdom) is able to parse about a build.xml used for auxiliary purposes. Is there any way to tell Eclipse to ignore a build.xml or ignore Ant warnings in a particular project? Do I need to remove the Java Builder from the Builders tab of the project properties?
Situation: Large company with several internal Java applications that launched via Java Web Start from a Java Web Application. Users login into the Java Web Application and select a program that launches via Java WebStart. The application logs in a database when a user attempts to run an application. Once the application starts it marks the row in the database that it was successful. Problem: There are rows in the database where a user launched a program, but the application never updated the database that it started. There are a only a few causes that I can think of: The user did not have JVM installed or possibly the correct version The application failed to load due to a web-server/deployment issue. (For example not all .jars required by the application were deployed to the web server. The application had a connection issue with the database or a bug that caused it to not write to the database. Goal/Question: I would like to identify the quantities of the causes. Is there anyway to detect why a Java Web Start App failed to start, so that I can see how often this is the case? Is there another cause I might not be considering?
I have a class which extends OrmliteSqliteOpenHelper in order to provide a persistence module for an Android application. The problem is, whenever I access this class from the test project in Eclipse, it throws a NoClassDefFound Exception. The source code appears to be fine as the package is imported and Eclipse has no highlighting to indicate anything will go wrong, but it does. Here's the kicker: not only does everything else in the project work fine when accessed from the test project, but when I move this file into the test project voila it works perfectly! The issue is that it needs to be in the actual project in order for other components to make calls to it. Has anyone ever encountered this error or have any idea where I might be going wrong? The class path is set correctly as all the other classes work and the test project always has the main project added to its class path. I also tried moving the OrmliteSqliteOpenHelper object to an inner class: this allowed the outer class to be visible and touched but as soon as it tried to instantiate the inner class the same error occurs. Also, if I copy this file into both projects in the same package, an error occurs stating "class ref in pre-verified class resolved to unexpected implementation" whenever something in the main project tries to access this class. Clearly, there is some difference in the way the class is being compiled/handled between the two projects. I'm quite stumped :/ Thanks a ton for any assistance!
I have a webstart app which requires the user to authorize to run. Circumstances in the website in which the app is deployed make it necessary that the user does not hit refresh. So, the problem is, if they decline authorization, hitting refresh won't make it show up. What I'd like is a way to detect if the app crashed, so that I can redirect the users to a different page. OR The ability to give the user the option to re-show the authorization prompt without calling a page refresh. A note: I know these restrictions are kind of weird, but that is out of my control, nor was it my idea. Any help is much appreciated! [edit] Some clarifications: What happens when the user hits refresh, is they get redirected to an error page. This app is being used in a survey, though it is optional, I need a way to recover gracefully if the user denies the certificate. Also, this is the certificate for the signed jar, not something like an https connection or the site log in.
I wish i had more context to my question, but unfortunately, I'm posting this question out of desperation. I am unable to reproduce this with a smaller application, as I wish i could post it here. Unfortunately, all i can do is try to explain my symptoms, and hope that someone out there has seen something similar. I have a purely java application, which is getting OutOfMemoryExceptions on some client machines. Im providing 400mb of java heap space, but unfortunately, we're still see this issue. Grabbing a heap dump from my application before it crashes, i can see that there are an unusually large number of JPanel objects. Looking at the heap dump, what's interesting is the ONLY incoming reference to my panel is a "JNI Global Reference". Whats confusing to me is, Why would there be a JNI global reference to a JPanel in the first place? I only have ONE Frame. Under what circumstances would java need to create a global JNI reference to a JPanel? Although I have one theory, its not based on anything I've read, but i get the feeling that the finalizer thread is blocked. Unfortunately, i don't have a thread dump to prove this. My theory is, my jpanel was queued to be garbage collected, however, once it entered the queue, the queue itself is unable to process this. Is there anybody out there willing to share their theory or gut instinct? Since i can't reproduce this on my machine, I'm a bit handcuffed with respect to analysing this theory. However if someone out there is willing to give me another investigation route, I would be more than grateful. EDIT: I have a small update about this. My application also uses drag and drop, and analyzing the heap dump some more, i noticed that there are as many java.awt.datatransfer.Transferable object (which passes my JPanel as part of the transferable), as there are JPanels that have not been cleaned up. Whats interesting, is that the only reference to the Transferable object is again, the JNI Global. It makes me wonder if the finalizer isn't blocked on cleaning up the JPanels, but on cleaning up the drag and drop transferable object. EDIT: So In case anybody was interested, I believe I've determined the problem. So something i left out in the original post was out application embeds an HTML page using the windows IE COM libraries (using some third party library). Anyways, it turns out that either the third-party library, or the IE COM library itself grabs a JNI global reference while drag and drops occur. Unfortuantely, I don't have a work around for this issue, but I'd like to thank all those that have sent me suggestions while investigating this issue.
I'm trying to do a distributed transaction between two PostgreSQL databases. I'm using Glassfish v3.0.1. In my GlassFish domain I have my two connection pools setup to have a resource type of javax.sql.XADataSource with a class name of org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource. I'm trying to create an integration test on a stateless EJB method that is hitting both databases. To perform the integration test I am creating an embedded version of glassfish, and looking up the EJB through JNDI. When I run integration tests that only involve one persistence unit, they are working fine. This is the first distributed transaction that I'm trying to do, so I'm not sure if everything is set up right. I'm really not sure about how to find information on how to solve this, as I'm not really sure what the stack is getting at. I've looked at the logs in myDomain/logs and couldn't find anything - are there any other logs? The stack trace is below: javax.ejb.EJBException: Unable to complete container-managed transaction. at com.sun.ejb.containers.BaseContainer.completeNewTx(BaseContainer.java:5002) at com.sun.ejb.containers.BaseContainer.postInvokeTx(BaseContainer.java:4756) at com.sun.ejb.containers.BaseContainer.postInvoke(BaseContainer.java:1955) at com.sun.ejb.containers.BaseContainer.postInvoke(BaseContainer.java:1906) at com.sun.ejb.containers.EJBLocalObjectInvocationHandler.invoke(EJBLocalObjectInvocationHandler.java:198) at com.sun.ejb.containers.EJBLocalObjectInvocationHandlerDelegate.invoke(EJBLocalObjectInvocationHandlerDelegate.java:84) at $Proxy101.createAccount(Unknown Source) at cheetah.services.impl.EJB31_Generated_AccountService_Intf_Bean_.createAccount(Unknown Source) at cheetah.services.tests.integration.AccountServiceTest.createAccount_ValidParameters_AccountCreated(AccountServiceTest.java:60) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597) at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:44) at org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:15) at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:41) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluate(InvokeMethod.java:20) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:28) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluate(RunAfters.java:31) at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runNotIgnored(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:79) at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:71) at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:49) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:193) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:52) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:191) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:42) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:184) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:28) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluate(RunAfters.java:31) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:236) at org.junit.runners.Suite.runChild(Suite.java:128) at org.junit.runners.Suite.runChild(Suite.java:24) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:193) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:52) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:191) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:42) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:184) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:28) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluate(RunAfters.java:31) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:236) at junit.framework.JUnit4TestAdapter.run(JUnit4TestAdapter.java:39) at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit.JUnitTestRunner.run(JUnitTestRunner.java:518) at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit.JUnitTestRunner.launch(JUnitTestRunner.java:1052) at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit.JUnitTestRunner.main(JUnitTestRunner.java:906) Caused by: javax.transaction.SystemException: org.omg.CORBA.INTERNAL: JTS5031: Exception [org.omg.CORBA.INTERNAL: vmcid: 0x0 minor code: 0 completed: Maybe] on Resource [rollback] operation. vmcid: 0x0 minor code: 0 completed: No at com.sun.jts.jta.TransactionManagerImpl.commit(TransactionManagerImpl.java:330) at com.sun.enterprise.transaction.jts.JavaEETransactionManagerJTSDelegate.commitDistributedTransaction(JavaEETransactionManagerJTSDelegate.java:158) at com.sun.enterprise.transaction.JavaEETransactionManagerSimplified.commit(JavaEETransactionManagerSimplified.java:843) at com.sun.ejb.containers.BaseContainer.completeNewTx(BaseContainer.java:4991) ... 43 more
I'm building a web service with a RESTful interface (lets call it MY_API). This service relies on another RESTful webservice to handle certain aspects (calling it OTHER_API). I'd like to determine what types of best practices I should consider using to handle failures of OTHER_API. Scenario My UI is a single page javascript application. There are some fairly complex actions a user can take, which can easily take the user a minute or two to complete. When they are done, they click the SAVE button and MY_API is called to save the data. MY_API has everything it needs to persist the information submitted by the user. However, there is an action that must take place that is handled by OTHER_API. For instance, OTHER_API might handle sending out an emails. Or perhaps it handles adding line items to my user's billing statement. In both cases, these are critical things than must be completed, but they don't have to happen right now, they just need to happen eventually. If OTHER_API fails, I don't want to simply tell the user their action has failed, as they spent a lot of time doing it and this will make the experience less than optimal. Questions So should I create some sort of Message or Event Queue that can save these failed REST requests to OTHER_API and process them later? Any advice or suggestions on techniques to go about saving REST requests for delayed processing? Is there a recommended open source message queue solution that would work for this type of scenario with JSON-based REST web services? Java is preferred as my backend is written in it. Are there other techniques I should consider?
I'm trying to help another developer who is using Netbeans. When he runs or debugs some code of his in Netbeans (6.9.1) he gets an "Uncompilable source code" RuntimeException. I'm pretty experienced in Java but am more used to IntelliJ, and haven't used Netbeans at all. I've done it a bit of googling and it seems Netbeans will compile code even with errors, and then throw the RuntimeException at the errors. (Fairly bad behaviour IMO, but I guess some will find it useful.) I've got him to completely rebuild the project with no compile errors, but the RuntimeException seems to still occur. I assume he's got some bad cached class data somewhere deep within Netbeans. 2 questions: What is the best way to clear the cache so we can find out where the uncompilable code is? Is there any way of turning off this behaviour so the code won't run/debug unless everything will compile, so these RuntimeException's won't be injected into the code? I've googled a fair bit, but haven't found the answer to either of these questions yet. Update: More information: Turning off the "compile on save" option makes the problem go away. Turning CoS back on again brings the exception back. Unfortunately this isn't a fix, as CoS is a very useful option. http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=182009 seems the closest bug report, but it has been closed as "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE". Unfortunately the bug is hard to reproduce - the exception is happening in Java library code, when it calls a third-party library, so there isn't anything at the point the exception is thrown we can change. And the code will work for weeks, and then suddenly start throwing this error with no obvious reason why. We've tried manually deleting the entire build directory - still not a fix.

I asked a question previously about what shows up in the IntentChooser when I send an Intent with ACTION_SEND and MIME type "image/png". The problem is that some phones come with a default messaging app that is not showing up in the list, mine included (myTouch 4G) as well as a user that I speak with over email (using an HTC EVO). If I choose a Send or Share option from the built in gallery app or another application on the same image I'm saving and attempting to send directly from my app, Messages shows up in the list. From my app it does not. Other phones don't have this problem, so it's clearly a platform specific thing. But that doesn't mean I should just ignore the problem. So, I go to troubleshooting the issue. I register one of the activities in my app to receive the the same type of intent, and then hit a breakpoint to analyze the Intent object being sent from the two different ways of sending it. The problem is, the intent I'm sending and the intent being sent from Gallery or AndroZip (where Messages does show up in the chooser) seem to be the same. They both have the same action, same categories, same flags, same mime type. What else can I inspect on the Intent from Gallery or AndroZip to tell if there's some more information I can add to my Intent to get the default messaging app to show up in the chooser in cases where it is not?
I have a Flex/Java web application that uses Maven as a build tool. Currently, if I want to debug the entire application I use Maven to create the WAR file and use the cargo plugin to deploy the WAR file and start up the app server. I then launch an Eclipse (with Flash Builder 4) Flex "Web Application" debug configuration and start debugging. It all works very well, but I am looking for a way to make this faster. I'd like to be able to edit my Flex code and immediately launch my Flash Builder debug configuration without going through Maven. Currently the output folder for my Flex client module is just the "bin" folder of the project. In a perfect world, I'd configure Flash Builder to put it's newly minted SWF file (and assets) directly into the app server I am running. Assuming this is impossible with remote app servers, and also impossible with the local app servers I run from Cargo, perhaps I can use another approach to running a local app server from Eclipse? I don't know enough about Eclipse or Flash Builder to know what to do...HELP!

I've seen lots of remarks about Java's checked exceptions, with the implication that something else (often C#) is substantially different/superior in this regard. I'm not interested in the language wars aspect, but I would like to know how languages without checked exceptions differ from Java's model. Would you get the same result if you changed all Java's exceptions to extend RuntimeException? Java uses checked exceptions for system errors (disk full, network connection errors) and unchecked for programmer errors (invalid array indices, type conversion errors). Do languages without checked exceptions maintain this distinction another way or just treat them all the same? Since someone voted to close as subjective, I'll emphasize again: I don't care which language people think is better. I'm only asking about the actual operational differences that programmers will have to code around when using the different exception models. I only have experience the Java version, so I'm trying to find out how the other way works.
I have a requirement where I have to process number of messages. These messages will be inserted into a DB table by another process. All I have to do is to check for new messages in DB and send it to corresponding customer either email or http, depending on their configuration. The number of messages could be several thousands at any given time and the number of customers are around 1000. I am planning to design this the way producer consumer works. Like producer thread polls DB for new messages and puts them into Queue and worker threads read these messages and processes. At first it looked like JMS is the right solution for this requirement. But am seeking if any better alternatively like ExecutorService, using Threadpool suitable for this requirement given the following scenarios. if one message delivery fails, I will have to retry it several times at least for 24 hours. if one message delivery fails for a customer, all chances that other message delivery will also fail. So, I should try to send the first message before I process next message for that customer. That means if I have one queue for all messages for all customers, then if one message fails, others will not be processed. Can someone give me suggestion on how best I can handle this? Thanks in advance.

I've searched a number of places for other people who have dealt with this HttpRetryException problem, but all the ones I found encountered it with some apache service called CXF, which I am not using. What I am using is the java.net.HttpURLConnection. I create a connection, use setRequestProperty for "Authorization", get an output stream, write a bunch of bytes and then try to read the reply input stream. Most of the time this works, but sometimes I get the exception mentioned above. I can't avoid streaming because sometimes I need to write larger files than can be stored in memory, and at any rate most of the results I found searching indicate that isn't the real issue. They usually give solutions along the lines of bindingProvider.getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.USERNAME_PROPERTY, "username"); bindingProvider.getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.PASSWORD_PROPERTY, "password"); I am not using cxf or any other wrapper over HttpURLConnection, and have no service or binding provider to reference. And the username and password set with setRequestProperty works fine for authentication most of the time. I wish I could say what particular preconditions are necessary to reliably replicate the error, but so far it has been hit or miss.
My web app is running on 64-bit Java 6.0.23, Tomcat 6.0.29 (with Apache Portable Runtime 1.4.2), on Linux (CentOS). Tomcat's JAVA_OPTS includes -Xincgc, which is supposed to help prevent long garbage collections. The app is under heavy load and has intermittent failures, and I'd like to troubleshoot it. Here is the symptom: Very intermittently, an HTTP client will send an HTTP request to the web app and get an empty response back. The app doesn't use a database, so it's definitely not a problem with JDBC connections. So I figure the problem is perhaps one of: memory (perhaps long garbage collections), out of threads, or out of file descriptors. I used javamelody to view the number of threads that are being used, and it seems that maxThreads is set high enough to not be running out of threads. Similarly, we have the number of available of file descriptors set to a very high number. The app does use a lot of memory. Does it seem like memory is probably the culprit here, or is there something else that I might be overlooking? I guess my main confusion, though, is why garbage collections would cause HTTP requests to fail. Intuitively, I would guess that a long garbage collection might cause an HTTP request to take a long time to run, but I would not guess that a long garbage collection would cause an HTTP request to fail. Additional info in response to Jon Skeet's comments... The client is definitely not timing out. The empty response happens fairly quickly. When it fails, there is no data and no HTTP headers.
We're experiencing slightly strange webapp deployment behaviour under Tomcat 5.5.27 on Linux (both on CentOS in production and Ubuntu 10.04 for development). App A and app B are almost identical (exactly the same libraries, a copied Maven project), App B differs only in that its JPA entities are annotated to access a different table within the same schema (the JNDI database references are identical). When the apps are deployed into either environment, app B will not start. However: Manually starting the stalled app, from the Tomcat admin console, works fine (???). After any attempt to restart Tomcat, the alphabetically later app fails to start. Point #1 still remains valid (???) Logging is configured (log4j), however, we get nothing from [the yet-to-start] app B's logging, nor errors from Tomcat's 'catalina.out' log file (NB. logging is working once the apps are up and running). I've done a reasonably thorough search for information (Apache/Tomcat bugzilla, Google) but I've found nothing of real use. Other posts have sighted the use of the antijarlocking and antiresourcelocking attributes on the server's 'context.xml' 'Context' node, but there is also a suggestion that this is unecessary/inaffective under Linux (hasn't appeared to work here, either). Any ideas? Cheers Rich P.S. Upgrading from Tomcat 5.5.x isn't an option, currently (IT support etc.).

According to http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html The Iterators returned by Vector's iterator and listIterator methods are fail-fast: if the Vector is structurally modified at any time after the Iterator is created, in any way except through the Iterator's own remove or add methods, the Iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the Iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future. The Enumerations returned by Vector's elements method are not fail-fast. Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs Could you give me an example to validate the above set of statements ?Im still unclear with fail fast behaviour of vector's method Iterator and ListIterator.? Confused :-((
I'm trying to debug a J2ME application on my Sony Ericsson K790i which is a JP-7 phone on a Windows XP with latest Netbeans, J2ME SDK, Sony SDK, etc. I can USB connect and use the SE Device Explorer. When I start my app from device explorer, it just gives a exception name (ArrayOutOfBoundsException) and a call stack with a list of "unknown". Is there a way to translate the call stack into procedure and line #? Is there a way to create a debug binary or any way to get a little more hints? My app is starting fine on the emulator. It even installs fine on phone but when I run it, it crashed with no info at all. I have tried even to use On Device Debug which my phone supports but I get a OAFcode=45 EXEcode=28 and debug session never starts. Though it does create a tempNNNN app in my phone. Any ideas that could help are welcome.
I have a web-application built with GWT (2.0.3) and run on Apache Tomcat 6. My application uses long polling to enable client-server conversations. When a client is unable to connect to the server it displays a disconnected message on the page and grays out the controls until it is able to resume conversation with the server. This happens through the use of the onFailure method of the rpc services; I keep track on how many consequtive exceptions I've received and if it passes a defined threshhold the above scenario happens. This allows notifying the user of a problem while in the background continuing to resume the server conversation. This has been the configuration for about 6 months, and without a problem. I compiled the application after a change and wanted to see it in stand-alone mode so I started up tomcat (not via eclipse) and everything seemed to work fine. When I ctrl+c'd the apache (while having clients up) I saw the clients displaying a 503 error instead of my app with the disconnected message. I then tried to reproduce the issue but was unable as the next times the app behaved as expected. I'm not sure if it's relevant but recently I added an UncaughtExceptionHandler to my module's onModuleLoad. Has anyone encountered such an issue? Do you know how I can make my client immune to such an issue? Thanks a lot, Ittai
I spend a lot of time debugging applications in Eclipse using JPDA. There are a few issues with the Eclipse debugger which really annoy me. Can anybody recommend plug-ins, better debuggers or perhaps tricks that I don't know of yet? In the "Variables" tab, you can type in and execute bits of Java code. However, you first need to click on something (I usually click on "this") to give it some context. Then, after you've typed in a lengthy Java expression to debug something and "execute" it, your expression gets replaced with the result, so you need to type it in all over again. Is there some better way, such as a console or something that I'm missing? When you're poking through data structures, the presentation in the debugger leaves much to be desired. You see the internal representation of Lists, Maps, StringBuilders etc. What I want to see is what these objects conceptually contain. Is there a way of doing this, perhaps using some other debugger, or an extension or something? When an Exception is thrown, is there some way of inspecting the state of the application where the Exception was thrown? Currently I need to set breakpoints just before the Exception occurs and then try to reproduce it. When I'm stepping over a line with many statements on it, I can't actually see which of those statements is being executed, except by "stepping in" to each one to see where it takes me. If no source code is found, Eclipse just stares blankly at you. You get a helpful screen saying "Class File Editor / Source code not found" which is completely useless. I'd much prefer to be able to step through the bytecodes so I can at least see what is going on. Does anybody know of a Java debugger that does this better than Eclipse?
I am writing some simulation code and managed to get my model running as expected. However when I reset the model (it sits on top of a large amount of code written by others that i don't have access to right now) and want to rerun it I run into trouble. From what I have gathered from reading posts on the site and errors i receive problems occur because of null pointer exceptions and Awt-queue errors because of some of the graphical elements running into trouble after the reset (because of those items they relate to are no longer valid). 0- What generally happens when the reset button is pressed in a simulation code? I guess (hope) everyone else has done their homework right and since i am ignorant about this i need to do some clean up of my own to make everything act nice. 1-Now what is the easiest way to fix these sort of problems that only happen after when rerunning code? 2-Also what are general guidelines for clean up of code after each run of a simulation?

I exported a working Selenium test case to Java, running it via selenium-rc's selenium-server.jar in Junit4 on Eclipse. The test case breaks the next step after opening the page, trying to write to an element. When stepping through the runtime I noticed the error, The requested URL could not be retrieved The following error was encountered: Unable to determine IP address from host name for unknown server name This means that: The cache was not able to resolve the hostname presented in the URL. Check if the address is correct. So, I changed the url to the corresponding IP address of the web page, but now I am timing out. Opening the page using both the url and IP formats manually is working, (except IP doesn't for IE8). I'm originally targeting Firefox, but will expand to other browsers once I have solved this issue. Is there a security issue involved with Selenium opening a page in a browser via RC programatically that browsers don't like? What sort of issues should I be investigating to solve this?
I am trying to debug a JBoss out of memory problem. When JBoss starts up and runs for a while, it seems to use memory as intended by the startup configuration. However, it seems that when some unknown user action is taken (or the log file grows to a certain size) using the sole web application JBoss is serving up, memory increases dramatically and JBoss freezes. When JBoss freezes, it is difficult to kill the process or do anything because of low memory. When the process is finally killed via a -9 argument and the server is restarted, the log file is very small and only contains outputs from the startup of the newly started process and not any information on why the memory increased so much. This is why it is so hard to debug: server.log does not have information from the killed process. The log is set to grow to 2 GB and the log file for the new process is only about 300 Kb though it grows properly during normal memory circumstances. This is information on the JBoss configuration: JBoss (MX MicroKernel) 4.0.3 JDK 1.6.0 update 22 PermSize=512m MaxPermSize=512m Xms=1024m Xmx=6144m This is basic info on the system: Operating system: CentOS Linux 5.5 Kernel and CPU: Linux 2.6.18-194.26.1.el5 on x86_64 Processor information: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5420 @ 2.50GHz, 8 cores This is good example information on the system during normal pre-freeze conditions a few minutes after the jboss service startup: Running processes: 183 CPU load averages: 0.16 (1 min) 0.06 (5 mins) 0.09 (15 mins) CPU usage: 0% user, 0% kernel, 1% IO, 99% idle Real memory: 17.38 GB total, 2.46 GB used Virtual memory: 19.59 GB total, 0 bytes used Local disk space: 113.37 GB total, 11.89 GB used When JBoss freezes, system information looks like this: Running processes: 225 CPU load averages: 4.66 (1 min) 1.84 (5 mins) 0.93 (15 mins) CPU usage: 0% user, 12% kernel, 73% IO, 15% idle Real memory: 17.38 GB total, 17.18 GB used Virtual memory: 19.59 GB total, 706.29 MB used Local disk space: 113.37 GB total, 11.89 GB used =========================================================== UPDATE TO THIS QUESTION IS ADDED BELOW Thank you very much for your comments. We are posting an update to this question that will likely be helpful. On 3 more occurrences of the memory issue, using the unix top utility seems to indicate that the JBoss process is the process consuming all the memory. When the problem occurs, it seems to happen very quickly. For example, after JBoss in running fine for a while (ex. several days), at some point users take certain mysterious actions after which it seems to take 1-3 minutes for memory consumption to ramp up to a level that causes major performance degradation and another 5-10 minutes for that degradation to become severe (ex. difficult to run simple bash commands through ssh). Of course, this pattern varies a bit depending on what users are doing on the web application. For example, when sorting by memory, on one occurrence the JBoss process is reported to have the following statistics (note that the real memory is 17.38 GB total and JBoss is only given a 6 GB heap): VIRT (total virtual memory): 23.1g RES (resident set size): 15g %CPU: 111.3% %MEM: 97.6% In that same example, 9 minutes later the JBoss process is reported to have the following statistics: VIRT (total virtual memory): 39.1g RES (resident set size): 17g %CPU: 415.6% %MEM: 98.4% After killing the JBoss process with a SIGKILL signal (-9), the new JBoss process is reported to have the statistics similar to the following: VIRT (total virtual memory): 7147m RES (resident set size): 1.3g %CPU: 11.6% %MEM: 7.3% Now that we know it is the JBoss process that is consuming all the memory, we want to figure out where it is going. We have tried jmap with a command such as jmap -dump:file=/home/dump.txt 16054 however this seems to make the server much less responsive and after some time nothing seems to happen (ex. prompt does not return). Our guess is because so little memory is available and the heap is so large something hangs. Also, we set the JVM options -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/dumps when starting the JVM but nothing seems to be written to the path when the memory problem occurs. These other options have been suggested: [1] use pmap to produce a listing of the process address space and look for large chunks (particularly large chunks that have the name [anon]) [2] send SIGQUIT (kill -QUIT) to the process several times in succession and look for common stack traces [3] use jstack to get a thread dump with a command such as jstack > tdump.out [4] mess around with the JBoss Management Tools / Console that's included with JBoss and see what kind of objects are left hanging around as the thing starts to eat up memory [5] explore Nagios as another monitoring solution Here are some follow-up questions: * From the above top report information, are there any new insights or thoughts on the problem? * For the above options 1-5, which are the most likely to work under the extremely low memory circumstances that the problem creates? * For the above options 1-5, which are the most likely to work under the very short time frame that the problem allows for diagnosis (ex. 1-3 minutes)? * Is there a way to automatically write to a text file a time stamp when the memory use of a specific process reaches several specific percentage thresholds so this time stamp can be used when looking through he JBoss log files? * Is there a way to automatically send an email with a time stamp when the memory use of a specific process reaches several specific percentage thresholds so this can be used for us to begin more focused monitoring?
I have two Applications Installed on Websphere Server v.6. 1. SGOApplication 2. ReportingWeb SGOApplication has a shared library mapped on Application Level i.e. SGOAPPSHLIB This library is having a logging framework jar(logsrv.jar). There is a class in logsrv.jar called SLEEventLogger which logs the messages to a file and uses some other third party classes which are all bundled in logsrv.jar I want to use logsrv.jar for ReportingWeb Application. I made a call for SLEEventLogger class from another class in ReportingWeb. I was able to build the ear and deploy it as logsrv.jar is there in the build path. After that, I tried following things, but none of them worked. Mapped SGOAPPSHLIB on Application level for ReportingWeb Application. Used application class loader first policy. Created a new Shared library REPSHLIB and put logsrv.jar in it. Mapped this library with application.Used application class loader first policy. Mapped REPSHLIB on server level. THIS WORKED for REPORTINGWEB Application but other Application SGOApplication is not able to find the class now. I am getting ClassDefNotFoundException: com.statestreet.framework.logging.SLEEventLogger when trying to run webapplication and control reached that particular class where I used SLEEventLogger. I tried to search for SLEEventLogger class from Troubleshooting>Classloader in websphere Console. I was able to find that SLEEventLogger class is being loaded by Module Class Loader. Could someone please tell me how to resolve this issue. I tried so many permutations and combinations on the server configuration but with no luck. I am totally messed up with this.
I am using Kryo 1.03 version in my Application. I am using FeildSerializer class in Kryo to register the POJO's in my application. My Application is using Applets as GUI and servlets at the backend and deployed on Weblogic10.3 server When Launching the application, we download all the jars from the Server to the client Side. In this scenario, we are using FeildSerializer to register the POJO class. I see the following line of error in access.log file of Apache. kryo.register(CurrencyStruct.class, new FieldSerializer(kryo,CurrencyStruct.class)); "GET CurrencyStructFieldAccess.class HTTP/1.1" 404 262 Applet is trying to search for CurrencyStructFieldAccess.class and is not able to find the class and is calling the GET request to call the above class on the server. Because of the above issue, we are getting a popup with the Security exception while launching. Can someone please help me to resolve the issue of Applets not calling the server side for the specified class and also how this particular class(*FieldAccess.class) is dynamically generated.
We need the ability to failover from one database host to the other in the case that the one we’re currently connected to goes down. From what we’ve read, “Transparent Application Failover (TAF)” and “Fast Connection Failover (FCF)” are only available on Oracle 10 and higher. But our environment has Oracle 9.2.0.8. What would be the best java solution to ensure our database connections failover? Using the oci driver seems to a better solution than the thin driver, however, we keep getting the “Unsatisfied Link Error: ocijdbc11.dll not on java.library.path”. We don’t have ocijdbc11.dll, but we do have ocijdbc10.dll in ${ORACLE_HOME}/bin Environment: Database = Oracle 9.2.0.8 with a RAC supporting two servers Server = Solaris 10 Clients = Windows XP, service pack 3 JDK = 1.6.0_20 Library = ojdbc6.jar Clients have Oracle thick client 10.1.0.2 installed. This gives them ocijdbc10.dll in their oracle bin directory Our connection string in tnsnames.ora: MY_SID = (DESCRIPTION= (FAILOVER=on) (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=host1)(PORT=1521)) (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=host2)(PORT=1521)) (CONNECT_DATA= (SERVICE_NAME=db.fully.qualified.name) (FAILOVER_MODE= (TYPE=select) (METHOD=basic)))) We create a datasource as follows: BasicDataSource ds = new BasicDataSource(); ds.setUsername(“username”); ds.setPassword(“password”); ds.setUrl(“jdbc:oracle:oci:@MY_SID”); ds.setDriverClassName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
I am writing a classloader for a long-running server instance. If a user has not yet uploaded a class definition, I throw a ClassNotFoundException; seems reasonable. The problem is this: There are three classes (C1, C2, and C3). C1 depends on C2, C2 depends on C3. C1 and C2 are resolvable, C3 isn't (yet). C1 is loaded. C1 subsequently performs an action that requires C2, so C2 is loaded. C2 subsequently performs an action that requires C3, so the classloader attempts to load C3, but can't resolve it, and an exception is thrown. Now C3 is added to the classpath, and the sequence is restarted (starting from the originally-loaded C1). The issue is, C2 seems to remember that C3 couldn't be loaded, and doesn't bother asking the classloader to find the class... it just re-throws the memoized exception. Clearly I can't reload C1 or C2 because other classes may have linked to them (as C1 has already linked to C2). I tried throwing different types of errors, hoping the class might not memoize them. Unfortunately, no such luck. Is there a way to prevent the loaded class from binding to the exception? That is, I want the classloader to be allowed to keep trying if it didn't succeed the first time. Thanks!
In JSP 2.0 specification it says about "tagdir" attribute of the taglib directive (JSP.1.10.2): Indicates this prefix is to be used to identify tag extensions installed in the /WEB-INF/tags/ directory or a subdirectory. An implicit tag library descriptor is used. A translation error must occur if the value does not start with /WEB-INF/tags/. As you see it must have a trailing slash, "/WEB-INF/tags" is not enough. It must produce a compilation error! We had lots of problems with a trailing slash and Eclipse. Eclipse slowed down on editing such jsp files. So we did remove the trailing slash and eclipse ran fine again. Most jsp tutorials and books don't use the trailing slash. In the jsp 2.1 specification there is no longer a need for the trailing slash. I am wondering if their is any jsp implementation out their throwing a compilation error? Or is it safe not to use a trailing slash?
I have a public class FriendMaps extends MapActivity that gets called from a menu item when selected, and at the end of that I have private abstract class DownloadFilesTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void> in there I do some server calls and put data into local arrays etc. But in my public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) of the FriendMaps activity I call new DownloadFilesTask().execute(); and get the following error: Error: Cannot instantiate the type FriendMaps.DownloadFilesTask From the documentation: AsyncTask must be subclassed to be used. That would be accomplished DownloadFilesTask extends AsyncTask there. The task instance must be created on the UI thread Maybe this is where I am confused? To my understanding the UI thread is the current activity being displayed - if so then the onCreate of the FriendMaps activity is the correct place to execute(); If full code spinets are required for further help, please comment and I'll add where needed.
I am trying to run a Java program from the bash shell. The program uses some 3rd party libs (mysql connector , amazon aws) This is just a standard java program , not running on a J2EE server or anything complicated. It always complains that it cannot find one of the classes in the third party libs (ClassNotFoundException) (If I remove references to this then it will complain about a different one). This is confusing since I have checked that the location of the jar files containing the libs is in the classpath. I have also tried putting the libs in the same folder as the .class File I am trying to run to no avail. I compiled the program using the javac command on the same computer and it had no problems finding the libraries , so I am confused as to why it cannot find them at runtime.. I also tried this from cmd under windows but got the same problem. The only rational explaination I can find is that it is due to security restrictions in the JVM , in which case it would be good to know how to disable them for this program? Thanks
I'm developing an application in Eclipse and it runs fine from within Eclipse. The problem I'm having is that when I export it to a jar file and run it from the command line I get a NoClassDefFound error for javax.mail.internet. In both my project build path and class path I have included the activation.jar and mail.jar libraries required for me to use javax.mail.internet, and like I said it works fine from within Eclipse but not when I export it to a jar. If my build path has those files and so does my class path why would this not be working? Here is the error stack: Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/mai l/internet/InternetAddress at javax.swing.AbstractButton.fireActionPerformed(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.AbstractButton$Handler.actionPerformed(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.DefaultButtonModel.fireActionPerformed(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.DefaultButtonModel.setPressed(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicButtonListener.mouseReleased(Unknown Sour ce) at java.awt.Component.processMouseEvent(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JComponent.processMouseEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.processEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.processEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.retargetMouseEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.processMouseEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.LightweightDispatcher.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Window.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source) Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.mail.internet.InternetAddress at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) ... 27 more
I've tried to look around for postings that might help me, cant find any. I am deploying an ear to JBoss4 server, and I started having this problem since I added a new project. this new project is defined as Java project in eclipse, and the EAR project has an EJB project that has the new Java project as one of the projects as its dependent upon - if deployed on JBoss locally through eclipse, there's no problem and everything goes smoothly But when being deployed to JBoss in test environment (outside eclipse), kept getting java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError on one of the classes that are defined in the new Java project. I looked inside the EAR file to get to the jar (EJB project), and then inside the jar, I can see the directory structure and all the class files from the new Java project - ie. The class that it complains about is right there inside the EAR->JAR and matching the exact structure that it's looking for. I am at lost to what else I can look at. Any pointers are greatly appreciated! Thanks
I have been provided with a 3rd party wsdl and a deployment descriptor etc for custom encryption for an Axis web service. I used WSDL2Java to generate the java classes and it all works pretty well... up to a point. When I invoke the methods several minutes apart they work correctly and return valid data. but when I invoke them (as I need to) in quick succession I get a plain old Server Error (below). If I ouptut the axisFault fault codes and details I get the following:- class org.apache.axis.AxisFault Fault Code = {http://xml.apache.org/axis/}Server Fault Reason = Server Error Fault String = Server Error Fault Details = [Lorg.w3c.dom.Element;@2d4ba772 [Server Error at org.apache.axis.handlers.soap.SOAPService.invoke(SOAPService.java:473) at org.apache.axis.server.AxisServer.invoke(AxisServer.java:281) at org.apache.axis.transport.http.AxisServlet.doPost(AxisServlet.java:699) at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:637) at org.apache.axis.transport.http.AxisServletBase.service(AxisServletBase.java:327) at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:717) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:290) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) at org.jboss.web.tomcat.filters.ReplyHeaderFilter.doFilter(ReplyHeaderFilter.java:96) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:235) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke(StandardWrapperValve.java:230) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invoke(StandardContextValve.java:175) at org.jboss.web.tomcat.security.SecurityAssociationValve.invoke(SecurityAssociationValve.java:182) at org.jboss.web.tomcat.security.JaccContextValve.invoke(JaccContextValve.java:84) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHostValve.invoke(StandardHostValve.java:128) at org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:104) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngineValve.invoke(StandardEngineValve.java:109) at org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:241) at org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor.process(Http11Processor.java:844) at org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol$Http11ConnectionHandler.process(Http11Protocol.java:580) at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.JIoEndpoint$Worker.run(JIoEndpoint.java:447) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:595) , 3rdpartyhostname Can anyone please help?

I'm trying to debug a webapp using Apache Camel from Eclipse and while I'm 'tracing into' I arrive at a point where Eclipse says that no source file is available and I can see bytecode shown in Eclipse (where usually I see sourcecode) but apparently I cannot advance into that bytecode (I try 'F6 / Step Over' but nothing happens) anyway (not that it would have been that useful compared to source code). So how are you supposed to trace into such a beast? I'm wondering if all these code-generating/code-intercepting layers aren't creating more problems than they're trying to solve. It seems like it's helpful as long as everything works but as soon as there's a problem, things become very hard to diagnose. EDIT I don't want to trace Apache Camel itself. I just want to trace a program that is using Apache Camel and I realize that things quickly gets very messy: basically you kinda lose your tracing ability because you jump from your Java source code to "something".
I'm using the Eclipse 3.6 development environment with the Google Plugin for Eclipse. I created a web project and configured it to receive email following the instructions at the link below. I would like to test receiving an email with an attachment. There is an email sending simulator as described below. Does anyone have an update to this simulator that includes attaching files so I can simulate receiving an email with an attachment. Note: My deployed app receives email with attachments just fine. My goal is to be able to test receiving emails with attachments in a test environment. Otherwise I can't step through the code. http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/mail/receiving.html "Once you set up your app to handle incoming email, you can use the development server console to simulate incoming email messages. You can access the development server by going to localhost:8888/_ah/admin/ (or if your app is running on a port other than 8888, use that value instead). In the development server, click Inbound Mail on the left side, fill out the form that appears, and click Send Email. "
I know that Vim/Emacs offers some enticing mouse-free capabilities for typing out programs. I have tried both and I love these facilities. But when coding Java, especially when using the libraries extensively, the auto-complete and error-highlighting features of Eclipse are too useful to be set aside. Is there a way to combine the best of both worlds?
I've already looked for the answer for this question, and I've found the following suggestions: If you are always expecting to find a value then throw the exception if it is missing. The exception would mean that there was a problem. If the value can be missing or present and both are valid for the application logic then return a null. Only throw an exception if it is truly an error. If it is expected behavior for the object to not exist, return the null. But how should I interpret them in my (so casual) case: My web app controller is receiving request to show details for a user with a certain id. Controller asks the service layer to get the user, and then the service returns the object, if it's found. If not, a redirect to 'default' location is issued. What should I do when someone passes invalid user id inside the request URL? Should I consider it as "expected behaviour" and return null to the controller, or perhaps should I call it a "problem or unexpected behaviour" and thus throw an exception inside the service method and catch in inside the controller? Technically it's not a big difference after all, but I'd like to do it the right way by following standard convetions. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. EDIT: I assume, that the URLs generated by the app are valid and existing - when clicked by user, the user with a certaing id should be found. I want to know how to handle a situation, when user tries to access URL with wrong (not existing) user id, by manually typing the URL into browser's address bar.

One of the beauties with Java EE 6 is the new dependency injection framework - CDI with the Weld reference implementation - which has prompted us to start migrating internally to JSR-330 in an implementation agnostic manner, with the explicit target of being able to have a core jar which is frozen, and then being able to add extra jars providing new modules replacing functionality in the core jar. I am now in the process of making the above work with Weld, and to be frank there is simply too much magic going on behind the covers. Either it works or it doesn't, and it doesn't provide very much help by default on what happens so you can investigate what is wrong and fix it. I would expect that there are switches to switch which can easily enable things like: What classpath entries are scanned and where? What was the result? What beans are available for injection for which class? What caused a given bean not to be considered for later? A given jar? In other words, I need to see the decision process in much more detail. For some reason this is not as needed with Guice, perhaps because there is much less magic, and perhaps because the error messages are very good. What do you do to debug your Weld applications, and how much does it help?
I am trying to debug a BlackBerry application on the simulator but it won't work. I right-click on the project, select "debug as" and then click on "Blackberry Simulator". The simulator starts up and then freezes with the message "Debugger attached" on the screen. Eclipse doesn't switch to the debug-view and does not stop at any breakpoints. Is there anything I have forgotten to do?

I am facing this problem while trying to run my java file by writing java filename .... I have read on many pages the possible ways this could be corrected but unfortunately I have been unable to correct my problem... First of all I looked at my environment variables and observed that there was no CLASSPATH set and I had pointed PATH correctly to my jre as well as jdk bin in C:\ Second I am able to run javac filename.java and observe that .class file gets built in the local directory. While writing javac -classpath . filename works writing java -classpath . filename (without .class) results in the same error. I just don't know how to run my program in command prompt!!!! Please do not give me links to the pages which have given the same answers that I have mentioned above as they do not work in my case..... Please help....
I am looking for a library with a Red-black tree and Linked list implementation offering iterators which are not fail-fast. I would like to have the same functionality as I do in C++ using STL and that is: insertion in the tree/list does not invalidate any iterators removal invalidates only the iterator that points at the element being removed it is possible to somehow store the "position" of the iterator and refer to the value it is pointing at This implementation would be nice as it would offer the ability to modify the list/tree while using the a part of it. Here are some examples: obtaining adjacent element in linked list / red-black tree to some stored value in O(1) batch insertions / removals (no constraints such as one removal per position increment) splitting linked list in O(1) via position of the iterator more efficient removals when having stored position of the iterator (e.g. by keeping iterators to a position in linked list, removal is O(1), not O(N)) I would also like that library/source code/implementation to have some Apache/GPL-friendly licence and is fairly extensible (so I can make my own modifications to implement some operations such as the ones from the examples above). If there exists no such library, is there some other library which could help me in implementing those two data structures on my own?
I'm having some problems tracing the reason that I can't load a java(fx) applet. The java plugin console for the browser has always been my sole source of information for problem solving. The reason it isn't much help at the moment is that the applet starts to load, downloading the jar files and outputting a percentage to the console along with the occasional statement to say it's on the next jar file. At some point in time (different percentages each time) the console just closes unexpectedly and the applet stops loading. I know this isn't much to go on but I was wondering if there was any way that the output from the console could be stored to a file on the local machine. To debug this particular problem, changing security permissions temporarily would be acceptable. The problem has occured on every pc i've tried, however if I keep refreshing after failure it seems to cache the jar files previously downloaded and thus get further through the loading process until it eventually works. My issue now is that on a particular customers network refreshing does not resolve the issue. I thought it may be a permissions issue writing to disk but I've tried an administrator account and still no luck. I've also tried a variety of browsers. It might also be worth noting that they go through a proxy server - when the applet tries to load it asks for the credentials for logging on to the proxy which seems to authorise fine. If anyone has a suggestion on what I could try it would be gratefully received. Thanks, James
I've been reading around about InterruptedException, and it's immediately apparent that there's no silver bullet solution to handle it properly in all cases. What I haven't seen yet, is some sample code demonstrating what can go wrong if the exception is handled improperly. Of course I realize some of the effects (such as thread starvation, which I think is one of them) are hard to demonstrate. I want to keep it limited to demonstrating the proper use of Thread.sleep(). How would you go about designing a somewhat realistic sample program for this? Here are my ideas so far: Make a simple GUI application to demonstrate reduced responsiveness. There'd be a UI thread, and a simple thread pool to perform some blocking task. The thread pool manager checks the interrupted status of the running threads to manage them. Swallowed InterruptedExceptions cause the pool to run out of threads, so the application becomes less responsive. This can help point out the different handling strategies for when sleeping in a managed thread vs. an unmanaged one. Have a bunch of threads that create garbage and sleep. There would be two types of threads: ones that restore the interrupted status when interrupted, and those that don't (swallow the exception). Then the demonstration would be to run the application in a JVM with little memory, and (hopefully) show that swallowing the exception somehow inhibits garbage collection or increases its overhead (due to long interval between invocations). Do these ideas make sense? Any other (maybe simpler) ideas?
I'm currently writing a custom component in Java that instead of writing a static HTML file will write a static docx file with all the metadata when a specific checkbox is selected. What I'm currently doing is: Having a user perform a check_in without a primary file, only metadata. This obviously fails because a check-in requires a file to be checked in. In the background, however, I generate a docx file and perform a new checkin with the meta values and the newly generated docx, which works fine. What I'm having trouble with at the moment is redirecting the user to the file which was generated in the background. The user's check-in fails and it seems to overwrite the redirect, leaving the user at a red screen. What I'm looking for is a way to either overwrite the file missing error OR send a Location header to the client to force a redirect.
I've spent a while searching on this and nothing that I find seems relevant specifically to my issue. I am making RPC calls so I wanted to change the path to one of my web services. It was something like mytestproject and wanted to change it to finalprojectname I went to the mytestproject.gwt.xml file and changed <module rename-to='mytestproject'> to <module rename-to='finalprojectname'> I then ran it through and got an error that [ERROR] Unable to find 'org/ediscovery/gwt/mytestproject.gwt.xml' on your classpath; could be a typo, or maybe you forgot to include a classpath entry for source? I then changed mytestproject.gwt.xml to finalprojectname.gwt.xml but still got the same result. I've looked through every possible file and can't find why it thinks the project is still named mytestproject. I have cleaned and rebuilt the project, etc but still the same. I am still fairly new to Java so maybe I am missing something obvious. I would greatly appreciate if anyone can offer any advice. Thanks
I am just learning axis and trying to deploy the stock example. However, when I typed in java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient, I get the error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/rpc/Service Exception Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.xml.rpc.ServiceException at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) Could not find the main class: org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient.

I am freaking out! Can anyone tell me what I overlooked to cause this?

hi i created all my apps in a single package name, when i was to upload it, i was success in uploading my first app. when i was to upload my second app i came to know that 2 app with same package name cannot be uploaded. Its not possible for me to create the second app once again with a new package name so because of my urgent i searched for a solution in net and i found that by refactor (i am using eclipse) i can change the package name and i did the same. But the name is not changed in the manifest file and i changed manually. Then i found some errors in all of my java class file showing error in the line "import.(package name).R", so i deleted all those lines. Now there is no error but the new problem is the app is running partially. The parsing activities which have been designed in my app are not running. Main part of my app is that only. Is there any solution to overcome this, as i am a new developer pls help me........
I'm in process of using EasyMock to write Unit tests for a number of collaborating classes. One of these classes (lets call it Foo) opens a network connection to a remote server and parses that servers' XML response into something the rest of the classes can use. Presently my tests only encompass scenarios in which everything is hunky-dory and the remote server is up and running and returning XML as expected. However, I would be happier if I could mock Foo so that I simulate what happens if the remote server is down, or there is some other problem that causes an IOException to be thrown by Foo. I have had a look at the EasyMock API, and I can't see anything that looks like a method asking a mock to throw an Exception. It's not absolutely essential for me to have Exception based tests, but I am curious if its possible with EasyMock, and I think it would be useful to test Foo's public contract in this way. Anyone done anything like this with EasyMock before? References EasyMock API
I think it is common to load data and refresh it after some time as the data may change. My question is about how to load it periodly and how to retry the load action when load failed . I tried to use AsyncTask to get this job done, but my code is ugly, I want to know if there are some elegant solution to deal with this. I have some concerns: Reload it rapidly when the first time it loads failed. For the words rapidly, I mean I do not want to wait the next refresh time point to load it again, because the data is not loaded the first time, so I need to load it as soon as possible. When it successfully been loaded, start the periodic refresh action. If loaded failed in one action, do not need to retry it as the data have been loaded before, I could just wait for the next refresh. Stop retry action if it exist or the periodic refresh when the activity goes invisible Resume retry action or the periodic refresh when the activity goes visible, still, retry action should happen rapidly, but the periodic refresh, I may want to check the last refresh time and to compare it with current time to determine whether the periodic refresh should start right now or later. Sounds complex, any good code example for this requirements?
I recently installed Helios on my windows 7 64 bit laptop and started seeing this error after I tried to run some simple java code: Exception occurred executing command line. Cannot run program "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\javaw.exe" (in directory "C:\projects\workspace\Testing"): CreateProcess error=5, Access is denied I double checked my 32 bit installation on my desktop running WindowsXP and I have it setup the same way. What is odd is that it works for a while after I first install eclipse, then it throws the error after a while and I can't get past it. I did run java -version from the command line, so the java home is setup right. If I remember right the widows preferences jre should point to this file, but why is the access denied error showing up? Aftermath: Sorry for all this. Something got messed up in my environment, so I reverted back to a previous stable point and then I reinstalled eclipse which solved the problem. I did more checking and this is a common problem, but for differing causes. Here are some links that may help: Tutorial for installing Eclipse with Windows 7 Stack Overflow question about crashes with Eclipse and Win7 Helios 64 bit windows 7 javaw access is denied issue Windows 7 Access is denied permission ownership issue
I've gone down the long road of using Linux for Blackberry development. Currently that means: bb-ant-tools - for building net_rim_api.jar - and other Blackberry goodies from the Eclipse plugin 1.3.0 preverify - from either the J2ME SDK or WTK, I forgot which Retrotranslator - for shoehorning some of Java 5 into J2ME bjavaloader - from Barry, for pushing apps to my device I'm pretty far off the beaten path, and I've given up Eclipse to boot because I prefer vim. The last remaining piece of the puzzle is: Blackberry debugging on Linux I've tried bjdwp, also from the Barry project. I can connect and see some console output when I attach via jdp. However trying to use jdp features seems to fail. Debugging as a remote application in Eclipse results in the following error: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Barry::Error' what(): Controller: requested mode not supported Could the best way be to setup jdwp in Windows in Virtualbox and connect remotely to that from Linux?
I have a SOAP web service served from a .net app. Sometimes we add to some of the object definitions but these are always optional and from a XML/HTTP standpoint the xml tags that represent those fields could be left out and it works fine. This should let existing users of the web services keep working. and this is exactly how it does work for almost everyone. Clients using .net, python, ruby etc all have no problem with this. But any change at all seems to break anyone using Apache Axis2 in Java. It seems that on every request Axis checkes the endpoints WSDL and verifies that it is EXACTLY like the stubs it has. If not then it throws an exception. (unexpected subelement) Is there any option in Axis to turn this feature off and have Axis just assume it's current stubs are correct? UPDATE: I should also note that this is a problem for clients using ColdFusion since it uses Axis2
I have always programmed my applications in php. But recenlty I discovered that best combination of language and server to achieve scalable comet functionality is Java + Jetty, because jetty support continuation, which eases the number of threads in the server. However, I'm slowly learning Java right now. I'm using Eclipse as my IDE with the plugin RSE(Remote System Explorer). When I used to program in PHP I just created a new php-file inside of htdocs in my Apache webserver, very simple to deploy. But now when I program in Java I have to compile the file too. Another flaw is that I cant create a Dynamic web project in RSE, so to deploy a webapp I have to drag all my file in my personal computer to my remote server and unzip and compile(manually via ssh). How do you guys deploy your java webapp in Eclipse? And yes I haven't found any good answer to this on the web yet before asking this question.
I just installed two tomcat in my machine and deployed same application on both. Both application and tomcats are running great. Now i tried adding both the services to services.msc. I done this successfully. Now i can start and stop any service from services.msc. But on accessing both application simultaneously, i found, i am able to access only one application and when i am trying to access other application, the corresponding service goes stop with a permgen space error in the logs. I tried increasing space of ms and mx and also i found that "Path to executable" under tomcat6w.exe is same. Now my concern is how to remove that permgen space error. In my points it looks that both services are using one tomcat. if i am starting tomcats through command prompt or through batch file both are working great but problem causes only on the case when i am accessing both services from services.msc. Can you guys please help me in overcoming this problem.
When running an application locally on my box, the application works perfectly. When deployed to QA, the error below is received. I am running Tomcat 5.5.23 locally and in QA.

This is the same error other people get: Java was started but returned error code=13 I've looked in many places and I understand the nature of the error. It's a combination of getting the PATH right and getting the right JRE. So far so good. Trouble is, I think I've done that. My path has C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin in it, and my eclipse.ini has these lines just above -vmargs: -vm C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\javaw.exe I do indeed have JRE6 and it's in that location and I did download it from Oracle, verified as current by that site. I'm running Windows7 64-bit. I think JRE6 got installed in the x86 folder because that's where the older JREs are located. Out of frustration I tried pointing to the most recent of those (jre1.6.0_22) but of course that did no good either. I've read numerous how-to articles and they all say more or less the same thing. Get the path right, make sure you have a current JRE, and add those lines to the ini file. Check, check and check. I'd sure appreciate it if someone could tell me what I've done wrong.
I'm trying to make a program that goes through all squares of a chessboard (size doesn't really matter, but for now it's 6x6) with a knight, called a "Knight's Tour" check it out on wiki. The tour is supposed to be closed, which means the knight on the last visited square can "attack" the square he started at. The code works fine for some squares, for example, input 'traverse(1,1,1)' in main generates output that shows not only is he traversing but backtracking and going back to traversing towards the goal successfully. However, would I input 'traverse(1,0,0)' instead, I get a StackOverflowError. Since it is successful sometimes, backtracking and traversing, I know the code works, I just have no idea how to get rid of the errors. I assume I'm making too many calls, but I have no idea how to get around that, there's alot of squares to visit :) Edited out the code, mostly because the teacher could find it an say I cheated.
I have some code, I inherited that was previously build on a Linux system. I tried to build it on Mac OS X Snow Leopard. My partition is Mac OS Extended (journaled). I know this is a case insensitive file system and the errors comes from 2 java classes that have the same name but different case. So that error is "normal". I tried to find a way around it, so I have build a Disk Image with the file system partition Mac OS X Extended (Journaled, Case-sensitive). On that volume I can create two files with the same name and different in case. I copied my project on it, but the error remained. I then created a new workspace on that volume and imported the project in that workspace, but the error still remains. I would think that the setting for that would be stored on Workspace level. Where does Eclipse store the "case-sensitive" / "case-insensitive" flag or why does Eclipse still generates this error although the workspace and project are on a case-sensitive volume. Is there a way this could work on Mac OS X on a case-sensitive partition? I know I could just rename the classes, but the code is a bit funky and it is not a simple refactoring in this case. Thanks
I have a Java application that calls lots of different native methods of a legacy application through JNI. But JVM crashes with a stack dump at random places, outside any JNI call. Sometimes it crashes during GC, sometimes during class loading and other places. I suspect that one or more native methods is corrupting JVM heap or some other data structure. I need to know which call is this, so I can fix the native implementation. The legacy application is a 3rd party DLL for which I don't have sources nor symbol information. To make it callable from Java, I built a wrapper DLL that uses JNI calling conventions. The perfect solution would be an extended JVM option that forces JVM to automatically check integrity of heap and its other data structures after each JNI call. Do you know of something that can help? P.S. Please don't tell me to build a socket or pipe layer between JVM and the legacy application, because our requirements disallow that. This is about bug detection, not architecture design.
I'm having some strange issues with repainting going on in a Swing app I'm developing. I'm finding that when I set the text of a certain component (it's just a status bar text label along the very bottom of the window) an entire table in a very different area of the screen is being told to repaint. It's causing some performance issues because it seems like basically the entire window is being asked to repaint every time I set the status bar text. I've been wandering around the RepaintManager trying to figure out what's going on, and have found that my entire main JPanel is being marked as a dirty component when I try to set the label of this text. However, I'm having trouble debugging at what point that's occurring and exactly why it's occurring at all. I've tried to read up on the repainting systems, but I can't determine why it would be necessary for a non-overlapping table to repaint when some other text label is set. I've used Swing Explorer to try to visualize the layout borders to make sure things aren't overlapping in some crazy way, and everything appears to be fine. I'm looking for an approach to determine what sequence of calls is asking the JTable to repaint. When I add a breakpoint on its paintComponent() and walk up the stack, I end up inside the RepaintManager's paintDirtyRegions() call in which my entire main JPanel (that contains everything in the window) is sitting inside the tmpDirtyComponents variable. Can anybody explain how my entire JPanel could get marked as dirty when I'm initially just setting a single status text label? If not, could you provide some guidance as to where to hook in to find the error? Thanks so much for any assistance you can provide!
We've got a signed java applet that is called from as aspx via javascript (We're not really a Java development shop, were mainly C# devs). I'm needing to debug through this applet but I'm having an isue that is not beeing seen on my colleagues machines. To attach the netbeans debugger to the applet we've traditionally removed all certifcates from the 'Trusted Certificates' store via the Java Control panel, deleted any cached applets (via the Java Control Panel) and then when the applet is downloaded and run, we see the security warning. At this point we able to attach the netbeans debugger, okay the security warnings (not checking the 'always trust' checkbox) and then having hit a breakpoint within the applet code, debug from there. However, whatever I do I'm not seeing the security warnings, which makes it a bit hard to attach to the applet. I've removed our certificate, zapped any cached applets, I've even 'clutched at straws' and removed and reinstalled the JDK (we're using 1.6 update 7, update 10 and update 20; all updates we know work with our implementation). I just can't get the security warning to appear. It's like I've got an 'always trust' flag permanently switched on. Any ideas gratefully received.

Our company recently purchased IBM's Tivoli Service Request Manager (aka TSRM) for managing our "catalog of IT services" (note, this does not necessarily mean web services, but what services do we as a department offer the company, like password resetting, etc.), as well as the Help Center and second-level support "portal". We also plan on using it for our change management processes (and have purchased other Tivoli products for said future purchase). Anyway... We have several WebSphere-based Java applications and also some standalone applications that don't run inside a container. We are hoping to connect our applications to TSRM so that if there are some more "serious" or "fatal" errors in our application, they can send "events" to TSRM and open service request (ie, help) tickets for our support team. The thought is that our support team can get the jump on a problem before end users call in. We already have TSRM set up such that if we send an error to Help_Center@ourEmailAddress.com it will automatically create a ticket within TSRM. I am wondering...is there another set of API's available to our applications? Such as a web service API, or a messaging API or something that we could send to as well, or is this email option the only one? Any one else have experience working with TSRM and custom applications?
Debugging performance problems using a standard debugger is almost hopeless since the level of detail is too high. Other ways are using a profiler, but they seldom give me good information, especially when there is GUI and background threads involved, as I never know whether the user was actually waiting for the computer, or not. A different way is simply using Control + C and see where in the code it stops. What I really would like is to have Fast Forward, Play, Pause and Rewind functionality combined with some visual repressentation of the code. This means that I could set the code to run on Fast Forward until I navigate the GUI to the critical spot. Then I set the code to be run in slow mode, while I get some visual repressentation of, which lines of are being executed (possibly some kind of zoomed out view of the code). I could for example set the execution speed to something like 0.0001x. I believe that I would get a very good visualization this way of whether the problem is inside a specific module, or maybe in the communication between modules. Does this exist? My specific need is in Python, but I would be interested in seeing such functionality in any language.
I am using PowerMock to mock static methods on JOptionPane, but the JRE doesn't seem to be very conform with it, because I get a java.lang.VerifyError at initialisation, as it checks the integrity of its own packages and classes. I have though of a few workarounds, but I'm not very happy with any of them: Write an object wrapper for JOptionPane and provide an interface for the methods I need (showInputDialog, etc.), so I can inject a mock or an stub for testing. This just moves the problem elsewhere, as I would still need to cover my wrapper methods, but at least they will be isolated from the logic. Use an instance of JOptionPane instead the class reference to call the methods upon it (I think I won't have any problems mocking an instance, as the class is not final). The downside is that I will get lots of warnings of the kind "invoking static method on an instance variable", but that's the price to pay. Do not mock JOptionPane at all and use Robot to fire the input events to handle it. This can be very cumbersome and not very robust... Besides that, I am using internal dialogs, and that requires extra work to set up the JDesktopPane, JInternalFrames and so on. Any other ideas or suggestions? Thanks! update: by te way, I've tried mocking a JOptionPane instance and it seems that the method dispatcher ignores the instance picks directly the previously existing static method (it makes sense, after all), so the second option is discarded.
Just a note: I know that in Java finally block should never throw exceptions, otherwise it's [very, very, very] bad practice. I know that I should use try-catch inside finally to handle (e.g. log or ignore) all exceptions and prevent them from propagating. I know that Java 7's Throwable has getSuppressed method, but I target Java 5 & 6. Problem: In Java, in try-finally if an exception (name it A) is thrown by try block, control reaches finally block (in case of no exception it reaches it also, but it's not interesting in this question). Then, if finally block throws an exception (name it B), exception A is suppressed, or masked/swallowed, and exception B is propagated to the caller. Question: Can i somehow detect the situation when one exception is suppressed by another and log/record the first one? ... I spent too much time reasoning why particular exception has been thrown and not knowing what has really happened. Rationale: Often problematic try-finally blocks are coded in a library (today it was Hibernate), so I'm not able to modify them. Solution constraints: As I noted at the beginning, possible solution should not relay on Java 7, but, on the other hand, does not need to be production grade (being such would be a bonus). AOP is an option here. (Please don't post trivial answers like "use Java 7 for development":)
I am running Ubuntu 10.10 using Java 6 and can not get FreeTTS to output any audio. I have tried it now on 3 different computers and even asked a buddy of mine to try it on his Ubuntu PC and he had the same problem. There is absolutly no errors that are displayed, after getting the MBROLA i no longer even get the warning about No MBROLA voices detected. blah blah blah.. Using the same computer I ran a virtual box and started Windows XP, i was actually able to get audio when running the HelloWorld.jar and TTSHelloWorld.jar however the freetts.jar is still silent when I try to input my own text. Command I use. java -jar lib/freetts.jar -text Hello When I hit enter it starts up and used to give me the missing MBROLA warning message but now it just sits there until i CTRL-C to stop it. I dont understand what I am doing wrong and why nobody else is having this problem, when I expierence it on every computer, well it works somewhat on Windows. Can anyone Help me? Thanks, John
Okay I'm rather confused by this issue. I'm trying to run some proprietary software that seems to work for one person but not for two others. The software is throwing this exception: Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-1" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid format at org.classpath.icedtea.pulseaudio.Stream.native_pa_stream_new(Native Method) at org.classpath.icedtea.pulseaudio.Stream.(Stream.java:263) at org.classpath.icedtea.pulseaudio.PulseAudioDataLine.createStream(PulseAudioDataLine.java:132) at org.classpath.icedtea.pulseaudio.PulseAudioDataLine.open(PulseAudioDataLine.java:100) at org.classpath.icedtea.pulseaudio.PulseAudioSourceDataLine.open(PulseAudioSourceDataLine.java:75) at org.classpath.icedtea.pulseaudio.PulseAudioSourceDataLine.open(PulseAudioSourceDataLine.java:90) However, as far as I can tell, I'm running Sun Java Hotspot. I'm on Ubuntu 10.10, which I know uses pulse audio as its default audio device, but when I tried switching to ALSA, I got the same exception. Since this code runs correctly on another computer, I assume I'm running into a configuration issue rather than bad code. What might be going wrong, and how can I fix it?
My problem is that I have a web application built and deployed as a WAR file to JBoss 6. My servlet fails to load a class in my app and throws a NoClassDefFoundError. I confirmed that this class exists in the correct location of the WAR file. All of my application classes exist in the WEB-INF/classes folder, along with my servlet class which executes without a hitch. In fact, it seems it is just this one class that is not on the classpath because other aspects of the application run great. JBoss is running on JDK 1.6_21, the app was built with JDK 1.6_24, this shouldn't be an issue right? Further this app runs fine locally within Eclipse, and when I deploy the WAR file to a seperate Tomcat 7 and Glassfish 3 server they both find this class without a problem. I am not expecting anybody to just instantly know whats wrong, if anybody has seen something like this happen before then please share your experiences, or if you have good tips or know of good tools for REALLY getting deep into classpath issues then please share.
I'm working on a fairly big Swing-based app (JPanels, JLabels, etc) and I have to find out why text-antialiasing (on JLabels etc) is not working. As you may know, antialiasing normally works automagically (with Java 1.6 anyway), that is, when one creates a simple Swing-app (for example, just a JPanel with a JLabel on it) the text on the JLabel will be antialiased out of the box. No need for System.setProperty("awt.useSystemAAFontSettings","on") and/or System.setProperty("swing.aatext", "true"). But this app is different, it does not antialias out of the box, it does not antialias with System.setProperty("awt.useSystemAAFontSettings","on") and/or System.setProperty("swing.aatext", "true") in the main(String[] args), on also not with -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on and/or -Dswing.aatext=true as VM-arguments. I've tried these and other all suggestions I could find on this site and on internet, but to no avail: this app just never antialiases, whatever I do or don't. I'm out of options now. So my questions are: What steps can I take to find out why antialiasing is not working ? What properties should I check ? What code should I trace with the debugger ? What circumstances could cause antialias not to work ? All insights are welcome.

I successfully set up a Tomcat server that runs Liferay through Eclipse. I'm working on a very simple portlet to learn more about the Liferay portal framework. Every time I make a modification to ANY file in my portlet and save, Eclipse attempts to republish or redeploy to the Tomcat server. Even on the most trivial change (changing one line a CSS file), an error occurs. The popup reads: An internal error occurred during: "Publishing to Liferay v6.0 Server (Tomcat 6) at localhost...". org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core.internal.ITomcatVersionHandler.prepareForServingDirectly(Lorg/eclipse/core/runtime/IPath;Lorg/eclipse/jst/server/tomcat/core/internal/TomcatServer;)Lorg/eclipse/core/runtime/IStatus Also, the Eclipse console reads: Apr 5, 2011 11:11:21 PM org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader modified SEVERE: Resource '/WEB-INF/lib/commons-logging.jar' is missing Apr 5, 2011 11:11:21 PM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext reload INFO: Reloading this Context has started 23:11:21,080 INFO [ExtHotDeployListener:205] Extension environment for customer-portal-liferay-portlet will not be undeployed 23:11:21,081 INFO [PortletHotDeployListener:404] Unregistering portlets for customer-portal-liferay-portlet 23:11:21,082 INFO [PortletHotDeployListener:435] 1 portlet for customer-portal-liferay-portlet was unregistered I think that the console error is a result of the previous error - I tried dropping in commons-logging.jar into /WEB-INF/lib/ and it just gets erased after the first error occurs. One thing to note: after this error occurs, I can run "ant deploy" on my portlet and it deploys successfully. It's only during a save that it crashes.
What I am trying to do feels counter intuitive, but Java keeps surprising me all the time, so I give it a shot. I am implementing an application with the help of the ESAPI library. This library provides its own exceptions. In addition to the well known exception behavior those exceptions do things like automatic logging with log4j and providing information to an intrusion detection module. Now I want to use these features in all parts of my application. Anytime a method of mine throws an exception, I don't throw a normal exception but a selfmade exception that extends from the new EnterpriseSecurityException. Works like a charm. But what can I do if I use a method, that throws a normal exception? Let's say I want to read a file using an java.io.FileInputStream? It cannot find the file and throws a FileNotFoundException. Unfortunately the FileNotFoundException does not provide the features of my own Exceptions, because it does not extend the EnterpriseSecurityException. Is there any trick in Java to change the exceptions a method throws? It sounds strange to me as I write this, but maybe someone can come up with a solution. The only idea I had so far is catching the normal exception, extract the relevant information, and build a new exception with it. But this seems pretty crude...
I'm making a library that contains a few methods for parsing string dates and times. I am having difficulty deciding what exception those methods should throw when the string argument isn't parseable. I'm considering several options: 1. java.lang.IllegalArgumentException - an invalid string is clearly an illegal argument, but, to me, IllegalArgumentException typically means programming error, and it's rare to want to do an explicit try catch for one. I think string parsing is often for external input and is more of a special case that deserves special treatment. If, say, you had a big block of code that parsed user input and did something else with it, you might want to wrap that code in a try catch block so you could handle the case of the user input containing an invalid string. But catching IllegalArgumentException wouldn't be great for pinpointing invalid user input, because most likely there'd be multiple places in your code that it could be thrown from (not just the user-input parsing). 2. java.lang.NumberFormatException - it's thrown by Integer.parseInt(String) and other similar parsing methods in java.lang. So most Java developers are familiar with it being the exception to catch when you're trying to parse a string that may or may not be valid (e.g. user input). But it's got "Number" in its name, so I'm not sure it really fits with things like dates and times which are numeric in a sense, but conceptually different in my mind. If only it was called "FormatException"... 3. java.text.ParseException - not really an option because it's checked. I want unchecked for this. 4. A custom exception - this gets around the downsides of IllegalArgumentException and NumberFormatException, and it could extend IllegalArgumentException too. But I don't think it's a good idea to add exceptions to a library unless they're really needed. Quoting Josh Bloch, "If in doubt, leave it out". (Also, in my case, for a package that parses dates and times it's quite hard to name such an exception: "DateFormatException", "TimeFormatException", "CalendricalFormatException" (like JSR 310) - none seem ideal to me when applied to methods that parse dates, times, date-times etc. And I think it would be silly to create multiple exceptions in a single package if they were all just used to identify unparseable strings.) So which option do you think makes most sense? NB There are good reasons for me to not wanting to use java.util.Date or Joda Time, or JSR 310, so no need to suggest those. Plus I think it would be good if this question was kept fairly general, since this must be an issue that other people designing APIs have struggled with. Dates and times could just as well be IP addresses, or URLs, or any other kind of information that has string formats that need parsing. Precedents Set by Other Libraries Just a few examples I found: java.sql.Timestamp.valueOf(String) throws IllegalArgumentException java.util.Date.parse(String) throws IllegalArgumentException (deprecated method, and the exception isn't declared, but you can see it in the source) java.util.UUID.fromString(String) throws IllegalArgumentException org.apache.axis.types.Time(String) throws NumberFormatException (also Day class in Apache Axis) org.apache.tools.ant.util.DeweyDecimal(String) throws NumberFormatException com.google.gdata.data.DateTime.parseDateTime(String) throws NumberFormatException java.lang.Package.isCompatibleWith(String versionString) throws NumberFormatException (in Java 7, this takes a string version number with dots - kind of like a date or a time in a sense) I'm sure there are lots of packages that use a custom exception, so I doubt there's much point in giving examples of those.
I have an implementation of a Spring AbstractHandlerExceptionResolver in my project. This handler takes care of all exceptions thrown from controllers. For the most part, this works very well in handling our exceptional cases and translating them into Views/HTTP responses. However, we have a requirement that something must be written to the response headers in every situation (even errors). This data must be configured/set in the controller actions themselves (as it is tied to whatever the controllers are doing). So, I'm trying to get this data through to my views so that it can be used. Logically, it makes sense to put this data in the Model... However, it looks like the HandlerExceptionResolver interface does not persist anything the Controller has set in the Model (which would contain the data the controller must set). Is there a way to access the Controller's model values in a HandlerExceptionResolver implementation? Thanks!
I am having some issues with a Maven profile setup to run HtmlUnit test cases. The profile uses the Maven Cargo plugin to deploy the application and then subsequently run interface tests with HtmlUnit on the deployed application. On my local machine I am able to run this Maven profile cleanly without fail every time, however on my continuous integration server which is running Hudson (ver. 1.386) this profile is hit or miss whether it is able to deploy or not. My Tomcat log shows this error: SEVERE: Error configuring application listener of class org.apache.myfaces.webapp.StartupServletContextListener java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory at org.apache.myfaces.webapp.AbstractMyFacesListener.(AbstractMyFacesListener.java:36) at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:27) at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:513) at java.lang.Class.newInstance0(Class.java:355) at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:308) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.listenerStart(StandardContext.java:4079) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.start(StandardContext.java:4630) at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.addChildInternal(ContainerBase.java:791) at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.addChild(ContainerBase.java:771) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHost.addChild(StandardHost.java:546) at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployDirectory(HostConfig.java:1041) at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployDirectories(HostConfig.java:964) at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployApps(HostConfig.java:502) at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.check(HostConfig.java:1345) at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.lifecycleEvent(HostConfig.java:303) at org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleSupport.fireLifecycleEvent(LifecycleSupport.java:119) at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.backgroundProcess(ContainerBase.java:1337) at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase$ContainerBackgroundProcessor.processChildren(ContainerBase.java:1601) at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase$ContainerBackgroundProcessor.processChildren(ContainerBase.java:1610) at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase$ContainerBackgroundProcessor.run(ContainerBase.java:1590) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662) Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadClass(WebappClassLoader.java:1645) at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadClass(WebappClassLoader.java:1491) ... 23 more The problem is perplexing because it can happen or it could not happen without ANY changes on the code and the fact that the exact same code runs perfectly on my local machine.

I am currently adding functionality to a JSF/Richfaces application and we are now integrating with external web services. Actions done with the services include: get user, get account, update user, update account, create user, create account. These services, along with the unexpected soapfaultexceptions, can return error codes in their response types. Mainly for failures along the lines of: login already exists, password doesn't meet criteria, account number already exists, and no user found. The calls are like so: BackingBean > Manager Level Class (mainly a pass through) > Web Service Client (makes the actual WS call). For the GET actions, the ID (username or account number) is passed down and the Account or User object is passed back up. The Updates pass around User/Account objects, same with the Creates. What would be the best way to get these errors back up to the backingbean so I can handle them via the UI? Of course I could check for error codes in the response, throw an exception and keep throwing it to the backing bean where I would handle it there. I could implement a Result type that would hold an Error Type and POJO/DTO that I was populating from the service. One of my colleagues recommended I use the decorator to decorate my USER or ACCOUNT objects with validators that I would also need to create. Basically I suppose my decorator would just hold custom Error types and the Validate() would just check to see if (List!= null && !(Size>0)). Correct? What are your thoughts on the proposed methods? #1 is the easiest, #2 seems to be more elegant and still simple, #3 is the "toughest" to me since I've never used the decorator pattern. However, #3 seems to be the most elegant while also being the most time consuming to implement. Let me know if you need any more clarification. Thanks, SO!
I often getting the following error when compiling a maven project with NetBeans: Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.3.1:install (default-install) on project xxx: Failed to install artifact yyyy: C:\...\.m2\repository\...\yyyy-1.0.0.jar (Access is denied) -> [Help 1] I don't know what is causing it. Solution is to erase the problematic .m2 content manually and the issue goes. But it is annoying. Anyone has a permanent solution?

When reading a question about testing a Java program several times with random seeds the word testing sparked of the association with unit testing in my mind, but that might not have been the kind of testing going on there. In my opinion introducing randomness in a unit test would be considered bad practice, but then I started considering the case where a (small) percentage of failure might be acceptable for the moment. For example, the code fails to pass the unit test once every 10^n for n > 3 and gradually you want n to go to infinity without the test going red, maybe yellowish. Another example might be a system-wide test where most of the time things go right, but you still want to limit/know how often they might go wrong. So my question is, are there any frameworks (full spectrum of testing) out there that can be persuaded to allow a percentage of failure in an huge/excessive amount of repeated tests?
In Websphere 6.0, I have a web application deployed "Project1". I am getting following error:- java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.app.X at java.lang.Class.initialize(Class.java:318) at com.app.Y.invoke(Y.java:61) where both com.app.X and com.app.Y are part of separate jar files present in \WEB-INF\lib directory. FYI, classloading policy is ParentFirst/application. I have tried deployment multiple times and restart. Any clue what else I can try? thanks Manglu and Bkail for your inputs. But issue was jar containing Y class was compiled on java1.4 version along with jar containing X class. However due to wrong checkin our CVS system, somebody compiled jar containing X class with different version of java. So during runtime, when Y class's classloader tried to locate the particular class version of X, it could not find it. Based on my understanding, there are 4 reasons why we can get noClassDefFound error in J2EE/JAVA environment:- i) Class is actual missing in classpath ii) Class is present but not visible in classloader hierarchy iii) Class is present but it is of different version. iv) As explained above, Class is present but having trouble in class initialization process. Anything else do you want to add?
I am getting this error in a program that creates several (hundreds of thousands) HashMap objects with a few (15-20) text entries each. These Strings have all to be collected (without breaking up into smaller amounts) before being submitted to a database. According to Sun, the error happens "if too much time is being spent in garbage collection: if more than 98% of the total time is spent in garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered, an OutOfMemoryError will be thrown.". Apparently, one could use the command line to pass arguments to the JVM for Increasing the heap size, via "-Xmx1024m" (or more), or Disabling the error check altogether, via "-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit". The first approach works fine, the second ends up in another java.lang.OutOfMemoryError, this time about the heap. So, question: is there any programmatic alternative to this, for the particular use case (i.e., several small HashMap objects)? If I use the HashMap clear() method, for instance, the problem goes away, but so do the data stored in the HashMap! :-) The issue is also discussed in a related topic in StackOverflow.
I came upon the following obstacle whilst developing in OSGi. One set of bundles, responsible for persistence, uses the com.mysql.jdbc.Driver class, offered by another (Springsource EBR provisioned) bundle. In another bundle I'm configuring the Quartz scheduler library to use a database as a jobstore. This is also done using the MySQL driver. Upon running however, I get a ClassNotFoundException. This is strange, since the persistence still functions correctly. Even more strange, when I try to manually load the class, using Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver") it is loaded correctly, implying that the class is indeed available for loading. Coincidence or not, the same seems to be happening with Drools... I repackaged some of the latest Drools jars as OSGi bundles, deployed them and when running again the ClassNotFoundException pops up. In both cases all supplier bundles are added to the required bundles in the manifest. Does this weird issue ring any bells? I'd be happy to hear about it...

I am considering using SLF4j to integrate multiple logging frameworks. The java.util.logging.Logger class has a nice method called setLevel(Level newLevel). It enables logging configuration at a class level, which helps creating readable and lean traces. I could not find the equivalent in the SLF4J framework. Is there any? The SLF4J Logger interface does not offer such a method. I have seen the other questions on StackOverflow and I have read the SL4F doc, but I could not come to a definitive conclusion. If SLF4J does not allow the fine-tuning I am looking for, then what is the real benefit of SLF4J? It seems to strip the interesting features of binding frameworks into a most common weak and useless denominator... If so, why shouldn't I convert all my code to my favorite Logging framework instead of going for SLF4J? EDIT: Ok, may be I am selfish in complaining about SLF4J not answering my hopes here. Yet, I still don't see much value in using SLF4j to integrate logging frameworks, because in the process, one looses access to very interesting features of those binding frameworks. The only positive addition I can see is the deferred creation of objects for log record message printing. SLF4J is IMHO surely not a best of many worlds, it is a minimal common denominator and that minimal is too low for proper software engineering. On the other side, existing logging frameworks are quite over-engineered and often miss key features offered by competitors. If one needs to integrate logging frameworks, I see two options with real practical value: i) Pick your favorite logging framework and convert all your code to this framework or ii) Create your own framework (it is dead easy, it only took me a couple of hours). My 2 cents. I have no issue with people having a different opinion. Just stating mine from my practical experience.
I am working with development of an application which, among other pieces of code, contains a number of servlets. The development environment I use is Eclipse (3.2.1, which is rather old) in which I run a Tomcat server (5.5.23, rather old as well) using the Eclipse Tomcat Wrapper plug-in for the task. All this runs on a RedHat 5.2 Linux system. The Java runtime I use is JDK 1.6.0(21), which I upgraded to (from a previous JDK 1.5 version) quite recently and as far as I can recall, the software combination above (together with the application I'm working with) did actually work: I could start the Tomcat server, it got up without errors or complaints and the application's servlets were available on port 8080. However, something has changed somewhere (could be in the application jarfiles themselves, I'm suspicious of essentially everything on the host to be the root cause of this). Now, when I try to start up the Tomcat server, I get the error sun.misc.InvalidJarIndexException in the console output. This happens for the following classes and methods: org.apache.commons.modeler.Registry registerComponent (happens 3 times) org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer initialize (happens once) org.apache.catalina.connector.Connector start (happens twice) I did find this stack overflow question regarding how to find the JAR of a Java Class useful and I did run find /usr -name \*name-of-suspected-jar\*.jar a few times to track down a number of suggested offending JARS. I also tried to check the runtime configuration of the Tomcat server in Eclipse, but could really not match the JAR files on the system with the CLASSPATH of neither the Tomcat runtime setup (or with the CLASSPATH used in the environment when starting Eclipse). That effort probably requires some more rigor on my part but before doing that (and that is why I right now don't post all the gory details regarding CLASSPATHs here), I did a read up on exactly what InvalidJarIndexException really is about. So, JAR files may contain an optional INDEX.LIST file which contains information about what classes (and methods?) to find in the JAR file. The idea is to short-circuit the search throughout all JARS in the CLASSPATH which is useful in a number of circumstances. Problem is when the INDEX.LIST file happens to be corrupt (or, is believed to be corrupt), that causes the loading of the class to be completely given up (the class loader does not fall back to searching all JARs in the CLASSPATH) and the error InvalidJarIndexException to be thrown. To make things more messy, the order in which JARs are searched might affect how the class loader treats the INDEX.LIST file: the INDEX.LIST file of one JAR might refer to other JARS and if those referred to JARS are not in sync with the first JAR's INDEX.LIST file, the class loader fails with this InvalidJarIndexException error. So (according to this StackOverflow question), it seems like this error can be thrown not only because a JAR file has a corrupt INDEX.LIST, it seems it can even be thrown on a JAR even if the JAR has a valid INDEX.LIST or legitimately is lacking a INDEX.LIST simply because a previously searched JAR has confused the class loader. (To put in another way, as things are, this exception might be thrown even for "innocent" non-corrupted JAR files due to offenders elsewhere on the system). So, after writing a mere novel, here comes my main set of questions: What is the best way to track down the precise .jar file for which each InvalidJarIndexException is thrown? What is the best way check if a randomly picked .jar file has an INDEX.LIST file and if so, if said file is valid (that is, non-corrupt)? What tools exist for this task? Is there an efficient way to automatically deduce the search order of .jar files? I can try to follow the CLASSPATH manually but to be honest, that is error prone and tedious. Is there an efficient way to figure out what .jar file there is in a search order which might confuse the class loader to accuse innocent, non-corrupt .jar files later in the search to have incorrect INDEX.LIST files? Disclaimer: I know I run old versions software (even if I have the latest updates of my Redhat 5.2 installed though) and I know a knee-jerk reaction for many people is to suggest that I don't put any effort whatsoever in debugging this but instead upgrade to a more recent version of Tomcat, Eclipse and Linux (Java is recent though). The reason I would prefer not to is that after looking into things, I've found it rather messy to do an upgrade or to try to install a separate modern Tomcat or Eclipse next to the RHEL5.2 provided Tomcat/Eclipse I use today. Also, I consider this kind of troubleshooting an opportunity to learn some useful nitty gritty details about Java and it's associated tools and features. Figuring out how the class loading works and what causes it to throw this InvalidJarIndexException on my system would be very educating! (But if this troubleshooting fails, I'll seriously consider to use a modern Linux, Eclipse and Tomcat... I promise)
My Android App does http posts to URLs like http://example.com/abc.php?email=abc@xyz.com So the Android App basically talks to PHPs on the server side and receives JSON responses and parses them to populate various views in the App. Works fine. My question is- How should I handle events below in the Android App so that in case these events occur in the server side application, the App should not FORCE CLOSE as it does now. Server Time out occurs and no response is received. The App force closes now. I want to handle this appropriately. Error Codes returned as a response to the App http post to the server. The App Force closes currently since I have not handled this. I have encountered these two scenarios where the App is not coded to handle these events. Please feel free to add any other events that might occur that might lead ANRs occur in Android App. A little code snippet or clue will help me a lot since I have never done this before. Thanks.
I've just downloaded a large project from source control which includes multuple projects-as I've done before without trouble. Usually the class depencies are already defined and I can import the packages into eclipse without difficulty. This time I seem to have difficulty with communication between projects. All my errors seem to be due to classes extending/implementing abstract classes or interfaces. If class A in one project extends or implements another class or interface from another project I end up getting exceptions when class A tries to call or override inherited methods. I've checked the build path and it seems correct, and I'm able to import the abstract class and interfaces, just not use methods from them. The issues only occur when the interface or class being implemented exists in a different package then the class implementing it. I've tried refreshing the packages, cleaning and rebuilding, and doing a rebuild from the ant scripts, none of these changes seemed to help. Can anyone suggest what may be wrong? Incidentally when I checked out everything from source control I think I may have gotten some of the eclipse metadata which had been checked in by mistake; which may explain how eclipse got in an inconsistent state. Thanks!
I'm in the arduous process of trying to upgrade a couple of our servers to use a current version of the application installed on it and I've gotten a bit stuck. I've gotten everything replaced and have narrowed my issue down to 1 .jar file. If I use the new version of this specific file, I can not get the service to start, and using the old version (and the new version of every other file), it runs fine. When I try to start the service I get this message: Could not start <service> service on Local Computer. The service did not return an error. This could be an internal Windows error or an internal service error. I've looked in the event viewer, and all it has are these entries every time I try to start it: <Service> has started Could not find the service start class <service> has failed to start Is there some place else that I can look that might be able to give a bit more information on why it's failing to start? We are using the 'JavaService' utility to create the windows process. This server is also running jboss. EDIT: I have also determined that it is not an issue with my SQL database as I just did all of the upgrades between the versions. I still can't get it to start with the new .jar, and the old .jar still works. Thanks!
I was trying to get keytool.exe running but the command prompt disappear so fast as soon as i open it. I also tried to manually type in the command prompt C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin it says 'program' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. I was unable to open program file folder itself. I went to environment variables and change the path to 1)C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin 2)C:\Program Files\ and more diff related path, etc etc but the result in command prompt is still giving me that error. when i type in 'C:>java' it showed the list (I attached the screen shot picture of the cmd but new users not allowed) i followed this direction from this link I can’t find the Android keytool and none of them were able to solve my problem. Am I missing anything else? I hope to solve this problem soon. !!!UPDATED!!! I found out that I have to type in cd before the path "cd C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin" I assumed that if i type in C: and press enter it would change directory to C: and after I can type the path from there but always getting error even at "Program Files" itself. Thanks everyone! here was the example in my command prompt C:>Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin 'Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. added the 'cd' before the path and... C:>cd C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin>
I'm dealing with a null pointer exception for which I have a stack trace. In my log files, stack traces provide line numbers. It seems like the line numbers on the exception's stack trace are wrong. This is in a project that's new to me. When I look at the source code at the specified lines, there is sometimes no code (a blank line) or an end curly brace (}), so I'm unable to find the cause of the NullPointerException. java.lang.NullPointerException at com.test.AddProductServlet.list(AddProductServlet.java:776) at com.test.AddProductServlet.list(AddProductServlet.java:436) at com.test.AddProductServlet.routeAction(AddProductServlet.java:263) at com.test.AddProductServlet.onService(AddProductServlet.java:145) at com.test.MqServlet.service(MqServlet.java:500) at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:803) I inserted breakpoints before the lines from the stack trace (i.e. 770, 430 and 260) and still can't find the cause of the exception. I am using Eclipse Helios with Java 1.6.0_16. Is this an Eclipse problem? If so, what changes are required? I redeployed the project but still have the same problem. What do I do next? How can I solve this problem?
The app works perfectly fine on the simulator and on the device. After adding a new set of images, it started to show on every run, on the simulator and on the device, a class not found exception. When trying to delete some images to find the cause, I get different classes not found when running. Compiling and packaging the application generates no warning or error. They even get signed. Some of the "classes not found exception" I get: java.lang.stringbuilder net.rim.device.api.ui.uiapplication I am guessing it has something to do with the total image size. The size of each image ranges from 100KB to 300KB, and we are talking of only 25 to 30 images in total. Adding the image outside of the 'res' folder doesn't generate the error, but the image isn't added to the final files. Deleting the images, the ones just added resolved the issue, but I need those images... Also, this application is not big, but when compiling, and packaging the app, it generates and signes 125 cod files. Is that normal? I am using Eclipse 3.6(Helios), and BlackBerry Eclipse Plugin SDK 5.0.0.25 on Win 7 Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

I have a question related to Spring 3 MVC, Ajax, and form:errors. I have a form I am submitting to the server and I am using Spring MVC. I have all the validation, controllers, etc set up and working fine. When I submit data that fails validation, I get the error message coming back and being displayed on the form as per my form:errors tags in my jsp. My question is... If I want to convert over to an Ajax approach, can I still take advantage of all the infrastructure of a "normal" Spring MVC app (ie, specifically the validator and form:errors features) to get the errors back to (and displayed on) the browser? I see how to submit Ajax requests, but I don't see how (or if) I can still utilize the form:errors capability of the jsp. Does anyone know if this can be done, and if so, point me in the appropriate general direction? Thanks in advance.
HI, I have a webservice running on glassfish3.1 server on one machine. On second machine I have a java (GUI) app, that is running and calls the above mentioned web service. In my webservice call, i send a file as SOAP attachment. It reaches the server, the file is then processed and then it is returned back to my client machine over https. If my file is too large and takes more than 15 mins, the operation fails and I get the following error: On Client side: Couldn't create SOAP message due to exception:

I'm using LibGdx to develop a Java-based game. I haven't decided whether I want the game to be deployed on Android or PC, so I figured I can at least develop+test on desktop and then decide. I've used LibGdx before and it worked fine.. but that must been before I did a complete system wipe (as I like to do a few times per year). Anyhow, when I try to launch the game in Eclipse as "Java Application" I get the following errors: -Exception in thread "LWJGL Application" com.badlogic.gdx.utils.GdxRuntimeException: OpenGL is not supported by the video driver. -Caused by: org.lwjgl.LWJGLException: Pixel format not accelerated Clearly this is caused by my GPU.. so I installed the latest drivers for my (integrated) video chip, but no dice. Anyone know anything about the "Pixel format" part of this? I haven't really done anything code-wise yet, I just have a blank application that I'm trying to get to display on my PC.
If the gwt project in Eclipse uses Eclipse to compile the java code using the automatic build feature then the gwtc compile using ant does not show any problems. If however, I clean all the existing .class files and then execute an ant build which runs javac and then gwtc, I get problems with my JPA entities such as: [ERROR] Line 12: No source code is available for type javax.persistence.metamodel.SingularAttribute; did you forget to inherit a required module? I should note that I am making sure that the classpath for the ant build is using the same exact set of libraries that is present in the Eclipse "Java Build Path". Since Eclipse does not apparently provide a log of the build process I cannot determine if there is some divergence. Since the projects have to build on Hudson on the build server (which has the problem I outlined) I cannot rely on a dev machine doing the .class generation and then gwtc doing the gwt compilations.
I am currently working on a program that scrapes through sourceforge.com and retrieves links of tarballs from the repositories of open source projects written in java. I initially fire an empty search command in the home page, this lists down projects in sourceforge.net with filters in the left side. I then filter by "java" programming language and then browse through each category (total 10 categories of projects) and retrieve links of the first 25 projects in each category. Thus, now i have a Hashmap having 250 project names and its web address. Moving further, I go into each of these links and get the "Browse Code" link in each of its pages. This page has the link for the "Download TARball". While I am trying to connect to different pages and move deeper from the home page, I get the following error at runtime (the error occurs randomly during execution time) Exception in thread "main" java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method) I tried to give a 3minute wait time between each "Jsoup.connect" request. But still the error persists. I am not sure why this occurs and how to solve this. Any suggestions, ideas are most welcome. A sample flow of links is provided below : 1. HomePage 2. Empty Search fired 3. Filter by Java and Mobile category 4. First project after filtering 5. Browse Link in the Project : http://wurfl.cvs.sourceforge.net/wurfl/ 6. Final Tarball Link : http://wurfl.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/wurfl/?view=tar
i am currently testing a server with an automatic test client that simulates a large number of users. Both the server and the client are written in Java. The client opens a tcp/ip connection for every user. Both the server and client run on Ubuntu linux, client runs on 11.04 and server on 10.04. The testing went good up till 27000 concurrently open connections, after that i decided to jump to 36000 (the servers and clients resources weren't really all that used up at 27000 so i decided to make a slightly bigger jump). When i tried running the test for 36k i got the following exception on the client side: java.net.BindException: cannot assign requested address As far as i know at 36k i should still have free ports since not much else is running on either machine and tcp limits the port number at 2^16 which is 65536. Now since it is linux i also set the number of open files for the user to 100k with ulimit -n 100000. But i am still getting the same exception. I'm wondering what else could be a possible cause for the mentioned exception, or does linux in some other way limit the number of outgoing connections ? Thanks in advance, Danijel
I have a strange situation where I can build a project with ant without any errors on my development machine but when I push the exact same source to the production server I can't get it to build on that side. I get 'cannot find symbol' errors related to specific syntax. I set up a git repo on the production server then cloned it. So I really don't get how I could build it on my side but not the production server side, since I got the code from the production server in the first place, and it was running previously. The code that causes the build to fail is not from the commit I pushed. I tried changing back to the master which has been unchanged since the original files were added to the repo and it still won't build for the same reason. So since I can't start the server again without the build completing & the reason that it fails has to do with code unlikely to be used any time soon. Is it possible to get ant to continue to build ignoring errors? Or does anyone have an other ideas what the problem could be? (I need to get the server running again even if it's unstable)
I have a table, say example1 and I'm using a jdbc statement to delete one of its rows. I have tried various methods, from delete from example1 where id = 1 to statement.addbatch(sql) but it does not delete the row. If I execute the same sql statement in Toad for Mysql it's able to delete the row just fine. Weird thing is that using jdbc I am able to delete rows from other tables just fine; it's just this one particular table giving me unexpected results. There is nothing special about this table. It has a primary key and no constraints/foreign key relationships. Also, this delete is a part of a transaction so auto-commit is set to false and once all records get updated/inserted/deleted then the commit is done. This does not seem to have any problem with any other table and all the updates/deletes/inserts are done just fine. Permission-wise this table has same permission for the db user that any other table in the db. Any ideas or pointers will be greatly appreciated!
While discussing another question I asked, @Aaron Digulla pointed out the following: If you installed the Java SDK, there should be a "src.zip" file in the root directory of the Java installation. If it's missing, download Java again. Eclipse should find the source automatically and show it to you when you open the type JTable (or when you click on the line in the stack trace). The file src.zip is present for me, but I still can't access the source of JTable like @Aaron said. What could be the problem? How can I solve this with Eclipse? The "Unknown Source" worries me, though. it means your version of Java doesn't have debug symbols. Make sure that you a) use a SDK while developing, b) that your SDK contains debug symbols, c) don't tell the command java to strip debug symbols when it loads classes. a) I'm using Eclipse, why shouldn't I being using SDK? b) How do I know if my SDK contains debug symbols? And if it doesn't, how can I add them? c) How can I check if Eclipse is telling java to strip debug symbols? Sorry for these banal questions, but I feel like I don't fully understand the Java development process.
I am using TFS 2008 and team build to compile some Java code using ant and the Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010 Build Extensions. My experience is with the Microsoft stack and ant is a bit of an unknown for me, we have a contractor who knows all about the Java / ant world but he's never used TFS before. I've created a TFSbuild.proj which calls an ant build.xml file. The build runs and compiles the code, the output is copied to the drop location, so all of that is good. However when I inspect the build log I can see lots of warnings from the Java compiler, but the build summary says 0 errors, 0 warnings. Our coding standards dictate that all compiler and static code anlysis warnings should be addressed and the build summary is a great way to let developers know that they need to look at the code. Is there any way of getting ant to return the errors / warnings back to team build so that it can populate the build summary with the warnings? Below are some examples of the warnings I can see in the log. [buildObjects] E:\Build\Sources\Project\custom\WEB-INF\config\Configuration\Audit Configuration.xml: warning: You are overring an object imported by init.xml with the same 'Audit Configuration' but with a different ID '#ID#Configuration:AuditConfiguration'. [buildObjects] E:\Build\Sources\Project\custom\WEB-INF\config\AdminGroup\Manager Operations.xml: warning: It is a recommended best practice that the object 'Manage Operations' specify an ID '#ID#AdminGroup:Manage Operations'. [buildObjects] E:\Build\Project\custom\WEB-INF\config\AdminRole\AdminRole-operations.xml: warning: ObjectRef to object 'IS Admin' cannot be resolved in the current project. [buildObjects] E:\Build\Project\custom\WEB-INF\config\Configuration\SubProcess-addAccessManager.xml:153: warning: Unresolved reference to variable 'user'. Variable is assumed to be a task input variable.
I need some direction how to best use Exceptions in a Java EE environment, serving clients via JAX-RS. At the moment, I have a number of exceptions, all extending RuntimeException, and annotated with @ApplicationException(rollback=false). In order to transport them to the clients, they carry a JAXB-annotated entity; and an ExceptionMapper is ready to convert them to proper, meaningful HTTP Responses (HTTP Status codes included). I have nothing specified regarding transactional behaviour, so I guess it defaults to CMT. Great stuff so far: when the server decides, it cannot fulfill a request, because input data is not valid/sufficient/whatever, it throws one of my BadRequestException, which makes it to the JAX-RS resource, where it gets mapped to a HTTP Response. Client is informed about what went wrong. The issue I have is that I always get a javax.ejb.TransactionRolledbackLocalException, caused by BadRequestException! I don't want the transaction to be rolled back! The @ApplicationException seems to be ignored... Should I not extend from RuntimeException but rather use checked exceptions? I though @ApplicationException was supposed to be the right way... For background information: all of my Exceptions leave the container/beans in a working state. No need for the bean instance to be destroyed or stuff like that.
I have inherited a library that uses and abuses of bitwise operations. Up to now, I have developed a method that prints the bit representation of the variables that are used in such bitwise operations. Furthermore, the developed method can also be used to show the result of a particular bitwise operation in a set of variables. However as the library code is quite extensive and these operations are used to handle the logic of the library, it would be great to have a debugging tool that could show the binary value of a variable or the result of a particular operation at runtime. This would avoid me to add many invocations of my method throughout the code in order to analyze what is happening in the code. Does any one know such a tool that can help me debugging bitwise operations in Java? P.S. Currently, I'm using Eclipse to debug the application but in the debugger the values are shown in a decimal representation.
I have an OpenGL engine that I made for Android as a separate project. In the past, to make stuff using the engine, I would just clone that project and add the game code alongside the engine code, but now I'm trying to make it more organized by having the engine code in one project and the game code in another project. Doing so would allow me to work on both the game AND the engine at the same time without having a bunch of packages and code in one project(that is, of course, assuming its possible) My background is in C++ so the way libraries and linking and stuff is done in Java is new to me. Heres what I did: I have the engine project "fooEngine" and the game "barGame" fooEngine has the packages com.fooEngine.blahblahblah with the engine code I need to use to make a game in the barGame properties I went to "Java Build Path -> Projects -> Add" and added fooEngine. This allowed me to use the packages and code from fooEngine in the barGame project. Everything was nice and peachy up to that point, but when I run it I get a noClassDefFound exception. Can someone help me sort this out :(
I'm reading exception handling in the book "A programmer guide to Java SCJP certificate". The author wrote that : If a checked exception is thrown in a method, it must be handled in one of three ways: 1.By using a try block and catching the exception in a handler and dealing with it 2.By using a try block and catching the exception in a handler, but throwing another exception that is either unchecked or declared in its throws clause 3.By explicitly allowing propagation of the exception to its caller by declaring it in the throws clause of its method header I understood clearly the first and third, but the second made me a lot of confused. My concerns are that : -It's still alright even if I don't throw any other unchecked exceptions, so why do we have to throw another exception at here? -Why do we have to re-declare the exception that we have caught, in throws clause? I think it's over by the handler. Thanks to everyone.
I've been battling with this bug for 3 hours. I have checked the build path and classpath and they are the same, this is quite a large webapp, running on Tomcat & Geronimo, it has a build file for each component & then one main once that binds them all together, but I've gone over the ant build files & compared them to others in working components that rely on 3rd party libraries and I don't see an differences. <fileset dir="${home.dir}/component/lib" includes="*.jar"/> It all seems to be in order. If I call this method from a JUnit test, run from within eclipse, is passes no problem, if I run the server I get this exception. Also I have two other libraries that this component uses & I just added it as a user library in eclipse & in the components lib referenced in the build.xml and it works without a problem. I've tried moving jars around resorting to trial and error when logic seemed to fail me & no luck yet. To make matters even stranger, I remember now, I had this issue with some code I wrote myself that wasn't even in a library. java.lang.NoSuchMethodError, since eclipse does occasionally do random things I just changed the method name and did a clean & it worked. I've tried cleaning and rebuilding the whole web app several times with no change. I'd like some advice about how to get closer to the problem so I can try find the bug, how does one debug classpath issues is there anywhere else the classpath is defened besides the build file? Any suggestions on how to pin point the problem would be appreciated.

I have created a GWT app that displays Zookeeper nodes data as it changes. I have tested my zookeeper watcher classes outside of GWT and know they work. However, when my servlet class calls my zookeeper watcher classes, and those classes try to call getChildren(...) on a zookeeper node my code fails inside of that call. This exact code works when called from other classes that aren't involved in GWT. It throws this exception com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.StatusCodeException: 500 The call failed on the server; see server log for details at com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.impl.RequestCallbackAdapter.onResponseReceived(RequestCallbackAdapter.java:209) at com.google.gwt.http.client.Request.fireOnResponseReceived(Request.java:287) at com.google.gwt.http.client.RequestBuilder$1.onReadyStateChange(RequestBuilder.java:395) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.MethodAdaptor.invoke(MethodAdaptor.java:103) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.MethodDispatch.invoke(MethodDispatch.java:71) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.OophmSessionHandler.invoke(OophmSessionHandler.java:167) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.reactToMessagesWhileWaitingForReturn(BrowserChannelServer.java:326) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.invokeJavascript(BrowserChannelServer.java:207) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpaceOOPHM.doInvoke(ModuleSpaceOOPHM.java:132) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpace.invokeNative(ModuleSpace.java:561) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpace.invokeNativeObject(ModuleSpace.java:269) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.JavaScriptHost.invokeNativeObject(JavaScriptHost.java:91) at com.google.gwt.core.client.impl.Impl.apply(Impl.java) at com.google.gwt.core.client.impl.Impl.entry0(Impl.java:214) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.MethodAdaptor.invoke(MethodAdaptor.java:103) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.MethodDispatch.invoke(MethodDispatch.java:71) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.OophmSessionHandler.invoke(OophmSessionHandler.java:167) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.reactToMessages(BrowserChannelServer.java:281) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.processConnection(BrowserChannelServer.java:531) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.run(BrowserChannelServer.java:352) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619) I cannot figure how to solve this error, and any help would be appreciated.
In JDBC the Connection, Statement, and ResultSet types each have a getWarnings() method that is specified to produce the first warning associated with objects of that type. The second and subsequent warnings, if they exist, are chained onto the first warning (if it even exists, null is produced if there are no warnings). The specs say that warnings associated with objects of these types are cleared after certain actions. For example warnings on a ResultSet are cleared when each new row is read. The SQLWarning type is a subtype of SQLException. So would the presence of a warning be indicated by an exception? And that exception would be chained to the associated object if the exception's runtime type is SQLWarning? What I'm wondering is this, and it might be driver specific, how do I know when I should call getWarnings() and expect a non-null response? Put another way, is a warning present on a JDBC object and available with getWarnings() only after that object has thrown an exception? (and that exception is the warning?) Should I call getWarnings() to look for warnings after every JDBC operation "just to be sure" if my goal is to observe every warning?
Been getting a NoSuchMethodError on one of our classes on a simple getter method. The odd thing is that we can debug the code and see the error occur in the debugger (by stepping over the relevant line), however we can also use the IDE (IntelliJ IDEA) to see the method does exist. Doing xxxx.getYYY() evaluates fine through the IDE expression evaluator. And going xxxx.getClass().getMethods() we can see the getYYY() method in the list. We have tried cleaning out all the built files, IDE output directories, IDE caches, rebooting etc and nothing seems to help. I would understand a NoSuchMethodError would be happening if we had compiled against something but then a different Jar/class was being found at runtime. But that doesn't explain to me why, at runtime while debugging to the line in question, we can see the method is there, but stepping over the line throws the Exception. Tried reproducing on another machine but it does not reproduce. Does anyone have any insight into what could be happening here?

I compiled two jar files and added them to the build path of my Android project. I received this error from Eclipse: Error generating final archive: Found duplicate file for APK: doc/allclasses-frame.html After reading How to fix "Error generating final archive: duplicate entry: AndroidManifest.xml" I realized that I could eliminate the error by re-exporting my jar file without documentation. I did this, and now my project doesn't have any errors, but what about my documentation? Is there a way to see the documentation from my libraries when I use the Ctrl-space autocomplete? I didn't have to re-export both of the jar files. I only had to re-export the one that is in the same Workspace as the Android project that I'm working on. However, Ctrl-space doesn't show me the documentation from either jar file. I'd also love to know how to configure a jar file so that links can be generated when I'm generating the javadoc.
I am programmatically using Ant to compile a set of Java files (using the javac task). On execution of the Java program, I get the error: Error starting modern compiler However, when I run the same build.xml from command-prompt instead of through the program, compilation takes place without any problesms. Another question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2577790/error-starting-modern-compiler) seems to suggest that this error is caused when Ant tries to use a different version of javac from the one already loaded into the JVM. However, I am not specifying any particular compiler to be used, and the documentation (http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html) seems to suggest that it should ideally used the javac loaded into the JVM. The program works on some machines but fails on others, the only discernable difference between the machines being the environment variables. The program needs to be executed on several different machines, each having slightly varying environment variables. So changing these variables is not an acceptable solution. I guess what I am looking for is some way to specify to Ant that for the javac task, use the compiler available in the JVM currently.
I'm coding a program in Java and I would like to connect to Prolog. Thus, I decided to use JPL. It is perfectly to use JPL on Windows Vista. Later, I have to change the OS platform to be Ubuntu 11.04. Unfortunately, there is an error: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/swi-prolog/lib/i386/libjpl.so: undefined symbol: PL_is_initialised Environment: Ubuntu 11.04 Java version 1.6.0_24 Eclipse Galileo Version: 3.5.2 SWI-Prolog version 5.10.1 for i386 Jpl (apt-get install swi-prolog-java) Family.java + family.pl I explain steps of working and problems as follows. step1: Install swi-prolog + jpl using Synaptic Package Manager step2: Run Family.java , found an error step3: Configure the library path at VMarguments step4: Run again, there is an error /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.24/bin/java: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/swi-prolog/lib/i386/libjpl.so: undefined symbol: PL_is_initialised step5: I also config the environment but the error still the same. The method that I used to solve the problem as in step 3 and 5 I searched from the internet. I can not find other solutions to try. Does anyone have any idea? Thanks in advance.
I have a Windows desktop Java application that was created in Eclipse using Java 1.5 JRE as the compiler and Oracle OCI drivers to communicate with multiple databases simultaneously. My system is running the Oracle 11g client. I'm a newbie still at Java and as such, I recently learned it's not best practice to install the necessary Oracle OCI drivers on the %JAVA_HOME%\lib\ext path. My program functioned correctly until the day I removed the ojdbc5.jar driver from the %JAVA_HOME%\lib\ext folder. Now, in spite of adding the ojdbc5.jar to my Build Path in the project within Eclipse, my application errors with the following message: Exception in thread "pool-1-thread-1" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: t2cCreateState at oracle.jdbc.driver.T2CConnection.t2cCreateState(Native Method) at oracle.jdbc.driver.T2CConnection.logon(T2CConnection.java:338) at oracle.jdbc.driver.PhysicalConnection.(PhysicalConnection.java:490) at oracle.jdbc.driver.T2CConnection.(T2CConnection.java:133) at oracle.jdbc.driver.T2CDriverExtension.getConnection(T2CDriverExtension.java:53) at oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver.connect(OracleDriver.java:465) at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(Unknown Source) at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(Unknown Source) at pkgPasswordChamp.Password_Champ.getConnection(Password_Champ.java:555) at pkgPasswordChamp.Password_Champ.executeStatement(Password_Champ.java:635) at pkgPasswordChamp.Password_Champ.loginToMarket(Password_Champ.java:678) at pkgPasswordChamp.Password_Champ.access$0(Password_Champ.java:663) at pkgPasswordChamp.Password_Champ$currentMarket.run(Password_Champ.java:753) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.runTask(Unknown Source) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) To resolve the issue, so far, I've attempted to modify my Windows XP Path System variable and my Windows XP Classpath System variable. Each variable appears to contain the reference to the necessary folders and files. Path: C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0;%ORACLE_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ORACLE_HOME%\bin\ocijdbc11.dll; Classpath: .;C:\Program .;C:\Program Files\QuickTime\QTSystem\QTJava.zip;.;.;C:\PROGRA~1\JMF21~1.1E\lib\sound.jar;C:\PROGRA~1\JMF21~1.1E\lib\jmf.jar;C:\PROGRA~1\JMF21~1.1E\lib;%systemroot%\java\classes;%ORACLE_HOME%\jdbc\lib\ojdbc5.jar;. Other forums have suggested that the java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: t2cCreateState error implies a DLL associated with the Oracle driver is missing. I attempted to add the oci.dll and the ocijdbc11.dll files to the Build Path in Eclipse, but I still received the same error. Can anyone explain why the "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: t2cCreateState" is being thrown and what steps I can take to resolve the error? It's a mystery to me why the application works fine with only the ojdbc5.jar on the %JAVA_HOME%\lib\ext folder, but fails when the ojdbc5.jar is removed and placed on the Build Path of the application. Any help for this newbie would be greatly appreciated!
I'm writing an Android application, and in it there's an array that I scan through in a few places. For some reason, sometimes it crashes in one of these places with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. When I debug it, the indices at the times of the crashes are always perfectly reasonable and within the bounds of the array (although different indices every time). More annoyingly, I can't look at the contents of the array, because every time I scroll through the variables the debugger disconnects right before I get to the array. I do set the array to an array that I create in a C function and return (using the Android NDK et cetera) and my best guess is that sometimes the array I get is seriously messed up, but it works just fine more often than not, and when it does crash it usually doesn't crash on the index 0 so whatever I'm getting from the C code must in those cases still work well enough to be read from some. Also potentially relevant information is that if I stop the app when it hasn't crashed the debugger has no problem with looking at the array.
I have an application (web application) written in Java and database on MS SQL. Both, Tomcat (with application) and database server are on my localhost. I'm trying run an application but in Java logs I have: org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create PoolableConnectionFactory (Login failed for user 'some-user'.) Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Login failed for user 'some-user'. In database logs error looks like: Logon Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 12. Logon Login failed for user 'some-user'. Reason: Login-based server access validation failed with an infrastructure error. Check for previous errors. [CLIENT: 127.0.0.1] When I'm tying login to server via Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio (choosing "SQL Server Authentication") everything is OK.

I'm developing with Java GAE and Google API's with OAuth authentication that requires an URL Callback that receives the access tokens. To test locally, running Jetty in 127.0.0.1:8888/home.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997, I've configure a DynDNS domain and set my router to redirect traffic from port 8888 to my machine. When I do that DynDNS domain shows my router web configuration page, like I was browsing to my router local IP. I've achieved a workaround activating my StrongVPN account to trick the router loopback, but when DynDNS refresh the VPN IP I can't access anymore, well I have to wait a lot of time to do the trick again. How can I avoid these loopback connections? Should I set up a proxy? Anyone has met this scenario (local debug GAE+G.APIs+OAuth)? Edit: I'll show you my LAN configuration (trying to discard causes): INTERNET (WAN IP) <-> ISP Router (192.168.1.1) <-> (192.168.1.2) Neutral Router (192.168.0.1) <-> (192.168.0.XX manual static IP) MacBook Local Server I set this port forwarding configuration in my ISP Router to redirect the incoming port 80 connections to my 8888 port - TCP port 80 to 192.168.1.2 port 8888 I set this port forwarding configuration in my Neutral Router - Port 8888 to 192.168.0.XX The configuration described would be OK because if I access through my mobile 3G connection to mydyndns.dyndns.org I access to Eclipse local web server. Then, I tried to edit host file as Owen "point your DynDNS domain to 127.0.0.1" says but without success :( If I set '127.0.0.1 mydyndns.dyndns.org' in my hosts file dyndns domain doesn't work, I think is because port forwarding, but I receive a not found, as if I type 127.0.0.1 in the browser. Eclipse server is attaching 127.0.0.1:8888 then port 80 doesn't have nothing to show. If I set '127.0.0.1:8888 mydyndns.dyndns.org' in my hosts file I access to the ISP Router web configuration page as I was typing 192.168.1.1. But the address is inmediately replaced on the browser address bar for MY_WAN_IP:80 Then I think that a connection loopback is happening. Any idea about how to fix that :(?
Now resolved - see end of question. I am attempting to debug a Java process with IntelliJ Community Edition's debugger. The socket is listening - but when I try to connect the debug process shows the following 'Connecting to the target VM, address: ':8003', transport: 'socket' It never makes the connection to the VM and I cannot debug. I have moved to a Windows 7 64 bit PC - on my old XP machine and could connect and debug this Java process (it's an app I build and maintain). It does not fail with the standard "Connection refused: Connect" error that you would get if no process was there to connect to. Netstat also shows the port is listening when the app is running. TCP 0.0.0.0:8003 :0 LISTENING Debug args for the app -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8003 -Xdebug If I attempt to run the debug session from IntelliJ on a remote machine, I can connect to the process running on my local machine, and debug. If I run the Java app on a remote machine, and use IntelliJ on my local machine, I can debug. It is only if I run and debug on the same machine that it fails - unfortunately this is what I need to do almost all the time. The only similar issues I have found are from 2004, to do with file paths with spaces, and were NetBeans, not IntelliJ. I have rebuilt and rerun my app ensuring no spaces or underscores in the path, no joy. My intelliJ debug settings are to debug my local machine on socket, attach mode port 8003 - sorry as a new user I can't attach an image. Other things I have attempted: Changing JRE versions Debugging using shared memory rather than socket transport I have not re-installed IntelliJ - I am using the same build as my fellow devs (10.5 IC 107-105) who don't have this problem. Changing the port the debugging process listens on (from 8003 to various other, unused according to netstat) I have tried using PC name, IP Address and 'localhost' to refer to the PC in the debug settings. Stuck. Any help much appreciated. Thanks Steve Resolved Well, a day of failing to solve then I find the answer 20 mins after posting. An invalid JNI signature character, only picked up when debugging. Solved by adding this arg when debugging. -Dcom.sun.xml.bind.v2.bytecode.ClassTailor.noOptimize=true http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6547438 Thanks for the assistance. Still don't know why it would work when debugging remotely but not locally before.
I can't run my process. It gives the following exception: "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" java -Xms32m -Xmx516m FilteringSNP_genus Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at java.util.Arrays.copyOf(Arrays.java:2882) at java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.expandCapacity(AbstractStringBuilder.java:100) at java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.append(AbstractStringBuilder.java:515) at java.lang.StringBuffer.append(StringBuffer.java:306) at java.io.BufferedReader.readLine(BufferedReader.java:345) at java.io.BufferedReader.readLine(BufferedReader.java:362) at FilteringSNP_genus.main(FilteringSNP_genus.java:65) I have tried different memory usage configurations like: java -Xms32m -Xmx1024m FilteringSNP_genus but it has not worked, and increasing the -XmxVALUE has given a GC overheadlimit exceeded exception: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded at java.lang.String.substring(String.java:1940) at java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken(StringTokenizer.java:335) at FilteringSNP_genus.main(FilteringSNP_genus.java:77) Could anyone provide some clue to fix this?

I have been designing a Java server, connected via PHP, that accepts a series of protein chains and performs computations on each of them. The computations are handled by external Perl scripts which return data to Java which is then inserted into a MySQL database. Java successfully executes the Perl scripts and returns the data, the problem lies in MySQL inserting the data. Java seems to be throwing an OutofMemory exception (running out of heap space). After Googling around most solutions seem to involve "Increase the heap size", the problem with this is for 10 proteins chains increasing the heap size to 500MB seems to solve the problem but if 20 chains are entered again the heap size will have to increase and 1000 chains (what the system should be able to handle) increasing the heap size is not an option. My question is this. What is a MySQL INSERT doing which is causing the heap to fill, and why is the JVM not cleaning up the excess data? The MySQL query is not a prepared statement and is just a simple INSERT and executeUpdate. We are using the driver mysql-connector-java-5.1.13-bin.
I have a new project that I'm trying to integrate with some existing functionality. In one of my old services I've include some initialization for the new classes and I used the "Organize Imports" feature to find and import the packages automatically. When I try to package the class with Apache Ant the build fails with errors saying that the packages don't exist. I've added the new project to the build path and double checked the package names. What could still be preventing the app from picking up the new project? Using: WebSphere Studio Application Developer version 5.1.2 WebSphere v5.1 JRE Apache Ant 1.6.2 EDIT: I re-ran ant with the -v argument (by the way light green text in the white console output is a recipe for eye-strain) and it turns out the package/project isn't showing up. I modified the properties to include the package so I don't know why it wouldn't show up, but that is definitely the issue. I hope that sheds some light. EDIT: SOLVED: Alright I feel foolish. The build ran this time. I opened build_new.xml and added "include name="[myClass].jar" />" to the path section under "fileset dir="${global.module.dir}">". There are other problems with other projects to deal with so I'm not sure if that fixed all the related issues but the build succeeded.

I am working on a java plugin interfacing with an H2 database. What I really want is an "Insert Ignore" statement; however, I'm aware that H2 doesn't support this. I am also aware of Merge, but this is really not what I want, if the record exists I don't want to change it. What I am considering is to just run the insert and let the duplicate key exception happen. However, I don't want this to fill my log file. The DB call happens in an imported class that I can't change. So my questions are: Is this a reasonable thing to do? I'm not one for letting errors happen, but this seems like the best way in this case (it should not happen all that much). How can I keep this exception from hitting my log file? If there isn't a way to block exceptions down the stack, can I redirect the output of the stack trace that is output? Thanks.
I've got a service which I'm trying to debug. I can debug the client-side of the service ie to the point the WS is called and results returned by the WS but not the service/server-side of that service. I've had a look at several articles on this and have strictly followed instructions but I'm still not able to achieve the desired result. I'm running the WS on Tomcat an dusing Eclipse IDE. Can somebody help? The steps that I've followed A) Setting tomcat in debug mode set JPDA_ADDRESS=8000 set JPDA_TRANSPORT=dt_socket catalina.bat jpda start I've added the following lines to the catalina.bat files located at {catalina_home}/bin directory. B) Deploying your application to Tomcat I wasnt sure whether needed or not but I've had already added the war file in the webapps folder previously and hence have the corresponding folder C) Connecting Eclipse to Tomcat for debugging Now this is where I'm not I'm not sure of the settings. 1) Start Eclipse 2) open the project containing the service that you want to debug 3) click on the arrow close to the debug button (the little bug) to see the drop down menu click on open debug dialog... (may also be labeled "Debug Configurations...") 4) in the debug window double click on the Remote Java Application on the left hand side list. This will create a new debug profile. 5) choose a name for the debug profile 6) select the project you want to debug (Which project should I be using?? I've selected the webservice project although its a different project that is used for starting the application and from there the webservice is called from) 7) the host is the address for your tomcat ie localhost 8) the port is the one you configured in when starting Tomcat, 8000 by default 9) Click on debug On doing that I get the error "Failed to connect to remote VM. Connection refused. Connection refused" I have the source code for both service and client and have them as separate projects in my eclipse. What needs to be done differently??
I have an activity that starts and then creates a new instance of NetworkHandler, in NetworkHandler i run it on a new thread so that the UI thread doesn't get stuck. The NetworkHandler has a run() method that sits on while((message = reader.readLine())!=null). reader is a BufferedReader and message is a String. Then the UI thread goes and does the layout. When the user navigates to the login screen and clicks the login button, the client sends a message to the server and receives information back, ie wither or not the username/password combination was correct. Then the thread that does the stream reading (the while loop) goes and tries to change the layout so that the game screen pops up if the login was successful or the oops you screwed something up screen. It gives me this annoying exception and it doesn't change the layout. Ive had this issue before in android, I don't understand why you have to call a View change from the UI Thread. It doesn't make sense to me. In Java i know that you can do that, i have make probably a hundred applications for my computer and i know that java doesn't have this issue. Can someone explain? All relevant answers are appreciated!
Let say that there are events that may occur (are less likely), but they should be registered. This is data that one just need for tuning ... to see what has happened and what needs to be changed and improved. Typically this is done in catch blocks when exception is thrown or just if some if condition passes. I don't want to write shell scripts and collect data from logs so I can either use DB and create a table for every context, which is possible in most cases, but it is extremely inconvenient for maintenance and refactoring in further development. Especially because the data will by typed as RDB is used. Mostly the only shared data is userId, time, component and varying data like fileId, fileSize || elementsCount, count deviance || etc. Or I can use some nosql store for that, which is also a little overkill to do that just because of this, but as the data has rather type free nature, I guess it would be more convenient. Could you please explain how you do it ? How is this even called ? I think that JMX doesn't deal with this scenario. Spring AOP or AOP in general deals only with the distributed nature of this.
We have some service running on 'n' number of hosts behind a VIP. When there is some fault that occurs with specific request call, we might be interested to know the reason by looking at the logs on the respected host where the fault occurred. since the request could go to any host, when it comes to tracking logs, we need to know from which host the fault originated. One solution is to store the host name in the database of our service along with other information. The alternative is, pushing the logs onto a common store and tracing it there. I personally feel that if we go with the first approach, we might end up in adding many such debugging related attributes in the application database thereby polluting it. However the second option is also not that easy to implement and incurs some overhead. Moreover on which host the fault occurred does not help much except in case the fault occurred due to some hardware specific issue. What do you guys suggest?
I'm developing a Bluetooth based app for android, using Eclipse. When I run the app on the emulator and debug I get no errors and as it should the emulator shows a Toast text saying "Bluetooth not available". This makes sense and obviously it is as far as I can test it this way and the logcat does not give any errors from my application either. It installs fine on my phone and I have signed it, zipaligned it and ticked the box to allow for non-market apps to run on my phone. However when I try to run the app it says "The application Bluetooth Chat (process.com.example.android.TestBluetooth_1) has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again". I have set Toast texts on every catch but nothing comes up after this message. I want to know if there is anyway I can surpress this error message to see the problem or find out what the problem is. Thank you, Emma
I have a java plugin to an application that I'm using (I didn't write it and don't have the source) that connects to my MySQL database...the only problem is that anytime I try to load the application I get a communication link failure 17:51:57 [INFO] Could not create connection: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server. 17:51:57 [INFO] Database initialization failed: java.lang.NullPointerException I have verified that all of my mysql settings are pointing to the correct port that I'm giving this plugin and I've also checked to make sure the user I created for this has privileges over the database it's going to be modifying. I'm out of ideas and it never times out, I would think it was the plugin but the plugin has many users and they use the plugin with MySQL just fine and I continue to have the problem after reinstalling the plugin. I'm sure it's an issue with MySQL but as far as I can tell...everything is fine, so any clues about what would cause this would be great. I've been reading around and the stuff I've seen didn't help the issue. SOLUTION for UBUNTU and MySQL 5.1: Added mysqld : ALL to /etc/hosts.allow
So I have this Java piece of code where I need to do some work on a bunch of items. I decided to parallelize this to get some extra boost and I though to use a ThreadPoolExecutor. The problem is that the work I need to do can throw an exception... Now I would like to shutdown the entire job to stop as soon as an error is encountered and report it back so I can handle it. Looking online, I found that the normal way this should be done is via ExecutorCompletionService and analyzing the Future results. However, this won't let me shut everything down when the first error comes by, as there is no way to loop over based on which task finishes first... So I did something that I thought was rather hacky and I'm curious if there is a better way to handle this. What I did was: 1) Have each Runnable that I will execute have a field for the Throwable that it might execute. 2) Override the TPE's "afterExecute" method and check if any checked exception got thrown (which gets recorded in the Runnable) or any unchecked one gets thrown (which should be reported in the second parameter of this method). If any did, then I issue a shutdownNow() on the TPE. Again, this seems a bit hacky and I am wondering if there is something I am missing. Thanks in advance!
I'm developing a multithreaded webserver applet and have been dealing with system.out.println's for the past week or so as my "debugging" tool. As far as I understand it, the .jar I build is split by a builder and put into .html files and then spit out when I access the web server. I am wondering if there is some way that I would be able to attach a debugger (plugin?) to Java's virtual machine that would allow me to step through the code as I operate the webserver- there are some critical exceptions that are very frustrating to track down. I believe they're timing issues related to the multithreading which makes them even more unreliable when attempting to locate, and may mean that the debugger won't process appropriately. I don't think it matters, but the IDE I'm building in is Netbeans. I've taken over a previous developer's hastily-not-quite-finished project and am in well over my head. =/ Thanks in advance for any possible solutions, I appreciate it.

i'm testing the android license verification library (LVL) in my app. my implementation is currently bone-stock. i haven't modified the library, and i'm using the ServerManagedPolicy. i have my developer account set to return LICENSED all the time. i'm testing on my physical device, and am signed in on the device with my developer account. a version of my app exists on the android market, but it does not have the LVL in it yet. my app checks the license at startup. so far, it seems to work fine, with one exception. when the app attempts to check the license when there is no network connectivity (airplane mode), the license check always fails. my understanding is that with the ServerManagedPolicy, the license response is supposed to be cached, so that one license check failure isn't going to disable the app. is this incorrect? i know i could check for network connectivity before checking the license, and then decide for myself how many failures to tolerate, but i thought that the ServerManagedPolicy is supposed to handle all that automatically.
I downloaded the examples of latest version for chapter 09 of “Mahout in Action”. I can successfully run several examples, but for three files, NewsKMeansClustering.java, ReutersToSparseVectors.java, and NewsFuzzyKMeansClusteing.java.

I have a java thread A that continously polls a folder RESULTFOLDER and checks if there are some new files present in it. Now the files are posted by some other program running on another machine into RESULTFOLDER.Now the files posted are all xml files (only xml).so at any point RESULTFOLDEr can hold only xml files. Now my thread A continiously polls the RESULTFOLDER and parses the xml files one at a time and then deletes it. Now sometimes what happenes is that if thread A tries to read and parse the file A at the time the other program is posting the file A .In this case i get exception in parsing file.Saying pre mature end of file. How can i resolve the problem? One way i think is to check date time of file creation and ensure that file is presnt at least for 1 minute or so.But i dont think java provides such API.How can i go about solving this problem?
I work on a application 100% automatically transcoded from Cobol to Java. In many places, the COBOL have taken shortcuts to eliminate some codes: they code a which generates a return statement while there are other statements after the return. The problem is the following: those "return" in Java means "unreachable statement" errors for all what's coming after the return in the same method. I am fine with those errors, but my question: the compiler (OpenJDK) stops at the 1st one (while there many of those + others...). So, it's painful because I have to remove those errors one after the other and rerun the compile each time. Pretty painful ! Is there a way to tell to the compiler "don't stop at 1st error but discover them all" ? PS: I run it via the ant . Does it make any difference than running the bare compiler from com Thanks a lot in advance ! didier
I am trying to refresh a Lucene index in incremental mode that is updating documents that have changed and keeping other unchanged documents as they are. For updating changed documents, I am deleting those documents using IndexWriter.deleteDocuments(Query) and then adding updated documents using IndexWriter.addDocument(). The Query object used in the IndexWriter.deleteDocuments contains approx 12-15 terms. In the process of refreshing the index I also sometimes need to do a FULL refresh by deleting all the documents using IndexWriter.deleteDocuments and then adding the new documents. The problem is when I called IndexWriter.flush() after say approx 100000 docs deletions, it takes a long time to execute and throws an OutOfMemoryError. If I disable flushing, the indexing goes fast upto say 2000000 docs deletions and then it throws an OutOfMemoryError. I have tried to set the IndexWriter.setRAMBufferSizeMB to 500 to avoid the out of memory error, but with no luck. The index size is 1.8 GB.
I'm trying to export my Android app in Eclipse with the newest versions of Eclipse, the Android SDK, the ADT, and ProGuard. If I add the ProGuard cfg file to the default.properties file (no modifications to the cfg file) and try to export a signed apk, the exporter fails, saying that it couldn't convert to dex bytecode with error 1. Commenting out the ProGuard file makes it export just fine. I've tried starting Eclipse with the -clean flag, disabling obfuscation with the -dontobfuscate flag, cleaning the project many, many times, and fixing Android properties. How do I fix this? EDIT: I had the acra library (jar) referenced and integrated, but have since removed it in an effort to fix this. It didn't help :( so, the only referenced library is the Android 2.1 library, added by the Create Project dialog. I've also tried deleting the project and re-grabbing it from my CVS, to no avail.
I installed the Aptana plugin (http://download.aptana.com/studio3/plugin/install) in my existing Eclipse installation on my Mac OSX Lion. Now my workspace has an error that freezes up Eclipse for about 20 seconds or so with an error as follows: Screenshot of error I confirmed that it was the plugin by uninstalling, which completely removes the error. Reinstallation and the same error returns. When I click ok, occasionally Eclipse returns but more often I have to restart it. Multiple windows of the error appear, as though it is a loop. Part of the log is listed below. Many of these similar chunks appear throughout the log. Any help would be appreciated. Am I missing a required library for this plugin to work? Something with the apache IOReactorException? Possibly an incompatibility issue with Lion? !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui.workbench 4 2 2011-08-06 11:32:42.982 !MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: "org.eclipse.ui.workbench". !STACK

I'm trying to do some simple FTP stuff in Android. After researching a little bit, I decided to go with the apache-commons-net. Here are the steps I took to get it working under Eclipse. Downloaded the package from here and unpacked it locally. In Eclipse, to add this new library, I go to (Window >) Preferences > Java > Build Path > User Libraries, click New, name it apache-commons-net, then Add JARs... to it by picking the .jar files that came in the download. For each .jar, I add in the Source attachment as described here. Once this is done, I right-click my project and choose Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries, click Add Library... > User Library > (Next >) choose apache-commons-net > Finish. The library then shows up alongside Android 2.2 in the Libraries tab. I start programming, and code completion works fine for the classes/methods/etc. from this library. Import statements are included, etc. Everything seems to work as it should. The problem is, when I run the app, it force closes and my LogCat in Eclipse shows the following error: Could not find class 'org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPClient', referenced from method <...> ... Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPClient It seems like I've set everything up correctly, so why is the execution complaining that it can't find the class??? Any ideas or help is greatly appreciated. Ian
So, nothing has changed with my setup over the past week. I have recently upgraded to Lion, but I have run this application several times since I have done that. Today, I click the "Run Main Project" arrow in NetBeans 6.8, and I get a dialog box I have never seen before... I have absolutely no idea what to do. I can find no reference to this error in Google. Steps I have taken: Reviewed the logs (nothing unusual up to the point where NetBeans freaks out. Reverted to a backup Netbeans installation (no change in behavior) Attempted to change the username/login information to the administrative Glassfish panel (no change in behavior) Removed the .netbeans directory from my home, and restored to a known good offsite backup. I have absolutely no idea what "8228 8228 8228" means. One thing important to note is that Glassfish is running and the creds that I have supplied to NetBeans do work. I can log into the running Glassfish admin panel with them. Any suggestions at all?
I'm trying to use ActiveMQ in my application. In order to test it, I wrote two small Java applications, one acting as a Message Broker (server) and one application acting as a client. The client is able to publish messages to the server and they are supposed to be sent back to all clients (similar to a chat room chat client). It works all well between a few machines even across a VPN network, but a few clients act up funny. Especially one computer connects properly to the client and message sent from it will be sent to all clients, but it just does not receive message sent from other clients. I am now wondering on how could I possibly debug this behaviour. I disabled the firewall on that machine, but I am still not able to resolve the issue. Is there anything I can do to debug this in a convenient way? Cheers, Max
Is there any method to prevent a Java EE application from starting if an exception occurs during application initialization? I'm basically looking for a way to cause the application to enter a "j2ee.state.failed" state (per JSR-77) following an unhandled exception thrown from a ServletContextListener or a Singleton Startup bean during application initialization. The EJB specification seems to indicate that if an exception occurs during initialization of a Singleton bean, the application will continue to start and run without error; however, only the bean itself may be in a state where it cannot be invoked. Unfortunately, this is not the behavior that I'm looking for. 4.8.4 Singleton Error Handling Errors occurring during Singleton initialization are considered fatal and must result in the discarding of the Singleton instance. Possible initialization errors include injection failure, a system exception thrown from a PostConstruct method, or the failure of a PostConstruct method container-managed transaction to successfully commit. If a singleton fails to initialize, attempted invocations on the Singleton result in an exception as defined by Section 3.4.3 and Section 3.4.4. The Servlet specification is a bit more ambiguous in its requirements, seemingly not requiring a container to behave in any particular way, but merely suggesting (through the use of the term "may") that the web module continue to start, but any requests should result in an internal server error. Again, this is unfortunately not the behavior I'm looking for. Why should the web application continue to start and appear to be running if it cannot handle any requests? 11.6 Listener Exceptions The container may respond to all subsequent requests to the Web application with an HTTP status code 500 to indicate an application error. In my experience, I've seen application servers handle this requirement differently. Some containers will in fact prevent the application from starting in these cases, whereas others will merely suppress the exception and respond to requests with 500 errors, as suggested in the specification. Am I overlooking any part of the specification that would prevent an application from starting if an exception occurs during initialization?
Let's say I have 20 classes open and I am debugging the app. I step the debugger thro its breakpoints. At a certain line, I get distracted and started scrolling thro the current source (which is like 2000 lines long). Then I started wading thro the other 19 source files. After ten minutes wading, I wish to return to the current debug line. I had even forgotten what class it was. What is the best way? Here are my worst practices: click on the step into icon and then step out click on the step over hoping I don't miss out on anything important. Search for the highlighted line in the long stack of debug trace. Fiddle around to change display to high contrast and then change it back when I locate the line. All the above is not good practice. If I am not wrong, when I used Visual Studio writing C#, we had a button that brought us right back to the current debug line. Is there such a button in Eclipse? Why not? If not, has someone a plugin to do that? Do you have an alternative convenient practice? A plugin would be great.
Is there a way to get some details regarding exception safety aspects of Java's standard classes? Mainly working with C++ and C#, I'm confused with Java exception specifications, so I need to understand the proper way of working with exceptions. To be more specific, let's consider ServerSocket. It starts listening for incoming connections as soon as its object is constructed. Then, you should use accept() to accept the connection (if someone tries to connect). In case you've previously configured your server socket with setSoTimeout(), there's a change that accept() will throw SocketTimeoutException because nobody tried to connect in a specified period of time. That's fine, server socket is still usable, so you just call accept() once again. But SocketTimeoutException is not the only thing that accept() may throw. What does all the other exceptions mean? If I wrap call to accept() with 2 catch clauses: for SocketTimeoutException and IOException, can I still safely use the related ServerSocket instance after I got into IOException clause? I'd really appreciate both Java-wide and ServerSocket-specific answers.
The documentation says that Socket's setSoTimeout(int) method throws SocketException - if there is an error in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error Have you ever caught this exception? When using TCP sockets, what kind of TCP error could make this method throw the exception? EDIT: Let me try to be a bit more specific and deeper. I'm not looking for the trivial (eg, a closed socket will throw this exception) that can be easily found elsewhere. Suppose the Socket (representing a TCP connection) has just been created, is connected, and not yet closed. I've not yet performed any reads/writes on it. I'm running on Linux (Ubuntu Server 11.04), so we can forget the case in which the TCP implementation doesn't support read timeouts. Now, can this exception be thrown in this situation? If so, what does it mean? Is it something specific to the current Socket instance? If I simply close() it and somehow obtain a new one, should it work? Is it a bigger problem I cannot recover from (such as a problem in the operating system), and should better shutdown my application?
So I'm trying to write a Java program that attempts to compile another Java project, and using any potential errors that come out of the compiler(in this case Javac) the program would attempt to repair the broken code. This is an extremely simplified view of what I'm trying to do, but my real problem is that I can't find any concrete list of errors that may come out of Javac. I don't want to turn this into a giant language war, but C#(of course) has an exact example of what I'm looking for http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228296%28v=vs.80%29.aspx I have already found http://mindprod.com/jgloss/compileerrormessages.html, but as stated somewhere else on this site, this list includes errors from Jikes and other compilers. If anyone has any info, I would certainly appreciate it. Edit: If anyone else has ever wondered about this I eventually tore open the tools.jar file located in jdk(version_here)/lib. From there your going to sun/tools/javac/javac.properties if you want to actually read the messages. You will need to extract this folder/file. Hopefully this is hidden somewhere in documentation because I hate for solutions to be this manual. Thank you everyone who posted answers, I'm going to look through everything to get a better approach to this.
I'm trying to automate a task through selenium that deletes a set of database tables. The corresponding code is WebElement element=null; while((element = driver.findElement(By.name("db__button"))) != null){ driver.findElement(By.name("db__button")).click(); driver.findElement(By.name("ConfirmButton")).click(); } However I'm getting the following error:- org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element: {"method":"name","selector":"db_vaults__button"} For documentation on this error, please visit: http://seleniumhq.org/exceptions/no_such_element.html This runs fine as long as there are tables in the database but when there are no tables left then the GUI doesn't show any list (rightly so) and db__button is not present on the page and therefore By.name("db__button") is failing. I guess there is something missing in this code which is trying to delete some tables in a loop. The suggested link in the stack trace doesn't has any information. Any Ideas? Thanks.
I'm migrating a JBoss AS5 app to AS7. I was running into NoClassDefFoundErrors due to AS7's redesigned modular class loading design. I was following the JBoss developer guide on how to resolve class loading exceptions https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Developer+Guide#DeveloperGuide-Resolveclassloadingexceptionsandothererrors , which has you doing things such as adding modules as dependencies in your app's MANIFEST.MF file, but I had a lot of trouble with this. None of my attempts to resolve my class loading errors using MANIFEST.MF or manually copying jars to my app's WEB-INF/lib/ directory seemed to work. In Eclipse, I tried right clicking on my project and manually adding classes specified by my class loading errors to my project's JAVA BUILD PATH. I was able to eliminate all of the class loading errors using this method. My question is - how is Eclipse storing the build path information and making it available to my maven build? Is it creating a MANIFEST.MF or jboss-deployment-structure.xml somewhere on the file system using the JAVA BUILD PATH information? I'd like to find whatever file Eclipse is using to store JAVA BUILD PATH so that I can deploy my application without having to manually add dependencies via Eclipse to my JAVA BUILD PATH. Thanks.
I successfully ran v1 migration with a create table DDL. I copied same to v2 file and ran - got the expected validation error message: Migrating to version 1.0.002 com.googlecode.flyway.core.exception.FlywayException: Error executing statement at line 1: create table people(id number(10) primary key, name varchar2(301)) Caused by java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-00955: name is already used by a n existing object MigrationException: Migration to version 1.0.002 failed! Please restore backups and roll back database and code I corrected the v2 file and ran flyway migrate again. Giving back the error message Current schema version: 1.0.002 MigrationException: Migration to version 1.0.002 failed! Please restore backups and roll back database and code I am not in a stage where a database backup is taken - simple trying to execute a fixed DDL. I don't currently see a solution short of flyway clean. Why cannot flyway try to execute FAILED versions again (if the checksum has changed)? Or shouldn't there be a flyway rollback command? I know I can very well modify the code to make it that way, but was there any reason why you chose it to behave this way?
I have to design a DAO that makes a call to a REST WS. This WS must return the user Credentials from the given username and password. Case 1 : the user was found => the REST WS sends http code 200 and a credentials response. Case 2 : the user was not found => the REST WS sends http code 400 and an error object with the cause. Case 3 : the user was found but his account is disabled => the REST WS sends http code 400 and and error object with the cause. Case 4 : the REST WS is not available What is the best way in my DAO to map the REST WS response ? 1 - I throw funtionnal checked exceptions in my DAO to treat the error objects cases and i return credentials response objects in normal cases. When REST WS is unavailable, i throw an unchecked exception 2 - I don't throw any functionnal exception in my DAO, as it is the Service layer's job. I return what the REST WS is returning, ie credentials responses and error responses in a wrapped object for example and i let the Service layer check for these objects to do the right job. When REST WS is unavailable, i throw an unchecked exception 3 - I only throw unchecked exceptions for error cases and i let the service layer decide what to do with it. And i return only Credentials response. Thank you very much in advance.
I am newbie in develloping with JOnAs platform, also in Spring and more genrally in web devellopments. After having somte troubles with JBoss 5.1.GA and tomcat 6.x,7.x i decided to move to jonas. I 'm now facing an issue in the deployment of my web application. The given stack trace is the following : 2011-08-25 04:56:04,467 : JPersistenceUnitInfoLoader.loadPersistenceUnitInfoImplList : No SharedCacheMode defined.

A common scenario in web applications: application has lots of classes that need to be stored in Session and are Serializable developer gets a bunch of warnings about "Serializable class does not implement serialVersionUID" developer shrugs and clicks on IDE's "add serialversionUID" and problem is solved? I don't like automatically adding serialVersionUID in principle since the solution essentially means that most importantly developer states "I know when my changes break serialization and when they do not, and want to control that instead of JVM", when in fact he does not know those things and does not want to control them adding serialVersionUID = 6266256561409620894L is confusing and ugly (ok, you can use 1L) I understand adding serialVersionUID in an application where class compatibility is an issue and developers actively take that into consideration and understand related issues. In a typical web application it's not very important when the serialization of classes breaks or not. When a new version is deployed, some extraneous serialized sessions may be broken but this is usually not a problem (and few applications actually properly handle version-compatibility of serialized sessios). Bottom line: isn't advice "Always define the serialVersionUID explicitly in your source files" simplistic?
My Java application has started to crash regularly with a SIGSEGV and a dump of stack data and a load of information in a text file. I have debugged C programs in gdb and I have debugged Java code from my IDE. I'm not sure how to approach C-like crashes in a running Java program. I'm assuming I'm not looking at a JVM bug here. Other Java programs run just fine, and the JVM from Sun is probably more stable than my code. However, I have no idea how I could even cause segfaults with Java code. There definitely is enough memory available, and when I last checked in the profiler, heap usage was around 50% with occasional spikes around 80%. Are there any startup parameters I could investigate? What is a good checklist when approaching a bug like this? Though I'm not so far able to reliably reproduce the event, it does not seem to occur entirely at random either, so testing is not completely impossible. ETA: Some of the gory details (I'm looking for a general approach, since the actual problem might be very specific. Still, there's some info I already collected and that may be of some value.) A while ago, I had similar-looking trouble after upgrading my CI server (see here for more details), but that fix (setting -XX:MaxPermSize) did not help this time. Further investigation revealed that in the crash log files the thread marked as "current thread" is never one of mine, but either one called "VMThread" or one called "GCTaskThread"- I f it's the latter, it is additionally marked with the comment "(exited)", if it's the former, the GCTaskThread is not in the list. This makes me suppose that the problem might be around the end of a GC operation.
So Im using NetBeans as my IDE for developing Android. However, when I get an exception, Netbeans does not break on the exception as I expect it to. I have checked the box "Stop on uncaught exceptions" that can be found in Options --> Java Debugger --> Stop on uncaught exceptions but that doesn't help. Furthermore, where can I see the actual exception message? I dont see anything. Right now I have no clue where and when an exception occurs, just that it does occur. I've read some on the netbeans.org (cached, the site seems to be down) about a bug in 6.9.1 that was fixed, but it doesnt seem to be fixed in 7.0 that I have. The debugging window doesnt say anything useful at all, gives some form av stacktrace that is pointless as it doesnt specify any of my own code. I switched from Eclipse cause that IDE sucks, NetBeans is much leaner, but the debugging needs to be fixed to be useful...
I think I understand what this error refers to. Basically as I understand it the cursor is empty. Which means the query is not finding any rows that equal its where statement. The query is basically SELECT * FROM questions WHERE _id=2 Now the thing I don't understand is that if I user a database with 7 records it is fine then when I change it over to one with 100 it runs this exception. The odd thing is that from other parts of the app I output the entire databases contents referring to specific columns. All the columns in both db's are called the same and when outputting everything from a table you can refer to everything. The problem seems to be when you query the large db specifically looking for one row. It returns empty. Is there anything that would be doing this, like special characters or anything else I have over looked?
I have a large program, that i modified in java. I used the intelliJ idea (community edition) IDE for compiling. When i go to run the program, it starts up the GUI and then proceeds to do everthing i want from it, with very few problems (of which are unrelated to the exceptions). But the code always generates class not found exceptions (even the original unmodified code does this once you extract it from the .jar file. Despite these errors, it executes within the IDE perfectly, while still noting the errors, but they don't appear to have an effect on the program. However, when i execute them from within the virtual machine (with java filename) the exceptions which are usually ignored prevent the ultimate execution of the program. The errors are exactly the same as the ones that the iDE shows, but the IDE ignores them! How could i get a virtual machine to ignore the errors and execute the program (is there an option to pass to java - for example java -ignoreerrors filename). Is this possible, or will i have to alter the code?
I am trying to write a unit test for a method which takes a string as a para- meter and throws an exception if it is malformed (AND NONE if it is okay). I want to write a parameterized test which feeds in several strings and the expected exception (INCLUDING the case that none is thrown if the input string is well-formed!). If trying to use the @Test(expect=SomeException.class) annotation, I encountered two problems: expect=null is not allowed. So how could I test for the expected outcome of NO exception to be thrown (for well-formed input strings)? expect= not possible? I not yet tried it, but I strongly suspect that this is the case after reading this (could you please state whether this is true?): http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/19383 This then seems to be the best solution I found yet. What do you think about it, especially compared to that: How do I test exceptions in a parameterized test? Thank you in advance for any help, I look forward the discussion :)
We have a production web application that appears to be having a thread stuck doing a bunch of work, and running up the CPU and load average. I know pretty much what the issue is - our DWR service is converting something extremely large to a Javascript object response. The problem is I don't know which service call is producing this large amount of data, because the thread is outside any of my code (it is in the DWR servlet converting my return value to the outbound javascript object... otherwise I could see my service method in the thread dump). You don't need to know about DWR to help me though, because my question is this: Is this any way for me to look into a deployed web application (Tomcat 6) and see what kind of state a thread is in, such as variable values, etc.? It would be perfect if I could take basically a "debug snapshot" of the thread, as if I had a breakpoint in debug mode during local development, but any solution that let's me see into or print out the value of something would be useful. Thanks! UPDATE If it is possible to not restart the server, that would be best, because this issue only comes up every once in awhile, and restarting makes the issue go away. Looks like JProfiler requires adding the -agentpath option to the JVM, so I would need to restart it.

I am getting these errors... Severe: JRE 1.3 or higher must be installed! Severe: JDK 1.3 or higher must be installed! ...when installing JAI (Java Advanced Imaging) 1.1.3 on Windows 7 (x64), with JRE 7 (1.7) installed at "C:\Program Files\Java\jre7" and JDK 7 (1.7) installed at "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0". Following http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/INSTALL.html#Windows, specifically this is what I did: Visited: http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/ http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/ (latest version) Downloaded: http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586-jdk.exe http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586-jre.exe http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586.exe http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586.jar.zip EDIT (QUESTION): It would be great if someone could break down the difference between these files. The instructions at http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/INSTALL.html#Windows do not go into enough detail and assume you already know what's what. EDIT: As noted in the comments below, the .exe are exclusive installs, but I wished to install them to all three locations (to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Sun Microsystems\Java Advanced Imaging 1.1.3" as well as to my JDK and JRE locations), as I was not sure which I would need at my work as a Java developer. As far as I know, I just need to install the JDK version, and the .zip is a manual install of the same thing. I am not sure though! Unverified. Installed: jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586.exe (installed fine) jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586-jre.exe <---- this is what causes one of the errors. jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586-jdk.exe <---- this is what causes one of the errors. The errors appear to be the same issue of not finding where Java (JRE and JDK) is installed. I have the following environment variables set: JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0 Path = ...;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin EDIT: This makes me think the problem is something deeper than environment variables, as there's no environment variables for JRE like there is for JDK (i.e., JAVA_HOME), right? Fixes I have tried (to no avail): Re-installing*. Re-downloading and re-installing*. Adding "C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin" to "Path" and re-installing*. Adding "C:\Program Files\Java\jre7" to "Path", without removing the above Path addition, and re-installing*. Adding "C:\PROGRA~1\Java\jre7" to "Path", and verified it was the proper folder, and re-installing*. Changing JAVA_HOME from "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0" to "C:\PROGRA~1\Java\JDK17~1.0", and verified it properly forwards back to the original folder in Windows, and re-installing*. Re-installing Java to a non-space folder, "C:\xxx\xxx\jdk1.7.0", where the x's are letters not spaces, and verified it works properly with "java -version" command line, and re-installing**. *Downloading and installing jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586-jre.exe **Downloading and installing jai-1_1_3-lib-windows-i586-jdk.exe None of this worked. :( I have not tried: Using an older JRE than 7 (1.7) Any help would be great. POSSIBLE (HACK) SOLUTION: What about manual installation? It's what we've opted to do at work. Is it possible to figure out what files are installed (without installing it since I cannot)? EDIT: I have also verified that "JAI (Java Advanced Imaging) Image I/O" has the same problems on my system.
I got very common thread hang condition although I don't understand why it happens. I have 2 threads: main() and errorStreamReaderThread In the main thread: - execute external process via Runtime.exec() - create new errorStreamReaderThread to consume error output stream - perform manipulations on input and output streams of external process( execute commands and read output of the commands) - send exit command to external process - set interrupt flag for errorStreamReaderThread - waitFor() for external process to terminate - return rc of the external process In the errorStreamReaderThread: - perform Buffered readLine on error stream while !interruptedFlag &&(line=br.readLine())!=null (errorStream is passed from external process from main) - perform log error stream I expect that even though readLine() block on stream - as soon as originator of this stream is finished (external process in this case) this readLine should be interrupted. Observed behavior - everything works fine 95% of the time - no hangs, both threads: main and error threads are finished and program finished. - about 5% it hangs - main thread is finished (waitFor is returned) - errorStreamReaderThread is blocked on BufferedReader.readLine (in fact the error stream for this buffered reader is no longer exists, since external process is finished) Additional environment factor is that this java class is executed as oracle java function (it is wrapped in the oracle) Please let me know what I'm missing here and why I got this readLine hangs on the non existing errorStream thank you
Ok, this is a doubt I always have when I'm writing any API, a.k.a., code reusable. What do you do with exceptions? There are different possibilities: Always throw them to the client. The exceptions are acumulative, so if method A uses the private method B and method B throws an exception and method A throws another exception, the client sees 2 exceptions and only should see the latest because is the method that he is invoking. We can acumulate a lot of exceptions. Only throw the exceptions produced on the method that the client invokes. What do we do with the internal exceptions? Just print the exception (printStackTrace())? Convert this checked exceptions to unckecked exceptions so we only have to throw them? Implement an interface that the client can use to set his prefered Log. I simply refuse do this. Extend a RuntimeException and always throw your customized unchecked exception. All the methods published to the client are well explained and says that the methods can throw the exception if the contract is fulfilled. I like this technique.
Trying to figure out my way around Sphinx 4 (the CMU speech recognition engine in Java), I tried to use a demo included with the distribution by altering it to what I wanted it to do (the name of the demo is Aligner). I am running into problems and want to use jdb from the command line for debugging the same. I read the documentation given here, but it is limited and does not have a solution to my problem, which in brief is as follows: I invoke jdb like so: jdb Aligner (name of the main class of the project). Set a breakpoint like so: stop at Aligner:33 The output I get (on the command line): Deferring breakpoint Aligner:33. It will be set after the class is loaded. In the file demo.xml (which is the makefile equivalent for this Project), javac debug=true is mentioned. My questions: 1. Where should I invoke jdb from? Should it be invoked from anywhere in the entire sphinx directory or should I invoke it from the same directory as Aligner.java? 2. How can I use jdb with the jar for this project? P.S: I know I can use Eclipse with this, but I am not sure I know how to do that. My first priority is to get this up and running. P.P.S: I am a Java newbie and do not know much about the language. My preference for the command line comes from my background of C/C++ programming on the command line. Any help is most welcome, Thanks!
Consider some code that can throw a checked exception (an exception of type Exception). Your code catches the exception, of course. You don't just swallow the exception either, your code reports it in some way to the user through your user interface. In a log file, perhaps, or using a GUI pop-up. Should the text you report to the user include the message text of the exception. That is, the text provided by Throwable.getMessage() or Throwable.getLocalizedMessage()? I think not, but it seems many disagree with me. So what have I got wrong? My argument is as follows. The message was created when the exception was thrown. It therefore at best can provide only very low level information, which can be inappropriate for reporting to a user. Philosophically, using the message seems to me against the whole point of exceptions, which is to separate the detection and initiation of error handling (the throw part) from completion of handling and reporting (the catch part). Using the message means the message must be good for reporting, which moves responsibility for reporting to the location that should be responsible for only detection and initiation. That is, I'd argue that the getMessage() part of the design of Throwable was a mistake. The message is not localised. Despite its name, getLocalizedMessage() is not much good because you might not know what locale you want to use until you catch the exception (is the report to go to a system log read by your English system administrators, or is it to pop up in a window for the French user of the GUI?). I hear that Java 7 has a much improved exception hierarchy for IOException, enabling you to handle different kinds of I/O erors in diffferent catch clauses, making the getMessage() text less important. That implies even the Java designers are somewhat uncomfortable with getMessage(). I'm not asking whether reporting the stack-trace is useful. A stack-trace is only ever going to be useful for an exception that suggests a bug. That is, for an unchecked exception. I think in such circumstances providing the low-level detail of the exception message is not just useful but mandatory. But my question deals with checked exceptions, such as file-not-found.
I'm trying to create a simple .jar file out of my project. The project is made of two .class files - the main class which uses the secondary class to generate a GUI. The main class is the actual "main" class that runs while the second class is just a class file with it's methods and it's also an extension of JFrame and imports javax.swing and java.awt.event.*. I use Jar to bundle it all up. I add a manifest file (with a new line character) which points to the primary file with the main method. The Jar file thus has two .class files and a folder with the manifest.txt in it. When I use javaw.exe to run it, nothing happens at all. So I try to run it in the command line and I get a NoClassDefFroundError about the secondary class. I noticed I get the same kind of error when I try to compile and run the second class in JCreator - no wonder, it doesn't have a main method, it's just a class file. When I run the main file from JCreator, everything works fine. Any ideas?
Possible Duplicate: Catching java.lang.OutOfMemoryError OutOfMemoryError are: Thrown when the Java Virtual Machine cannot allocate an object because it is out of memory, and no more memory could be made available by the garbage collector Java says: An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions. This feels like hearing: If you are drowning, be reasonable: you should not try to swim upwards to keep your head above water. Death is typically resulting from abnormal conditions. Let's imagine a scenario where one is running a service. For some reason, another application on the same server is eating a lot of memory, causing an unexpected OOM in your service. Is it such a bad idea to try to reduce this service's memory consumption in order to remain available to user? Or is there something more fundamental happening at the JVM level preventing the implementation of such a solution after the OOM has been thrown?
There is a lot of material out there which suggests that printing the stack trace of an exception is bad practice. E.g. from the RegexpSingleline check in Checkstyle: This check can be used [...] to find common bad practice such as calling ex.printStacktrace() However, I'm struggling to find anywhere which gives a valid reason why since surely the stack trace is very useful in tracking down what caused the exception. Things that I am aware of: A stack trace should never be visible to end users (for user experience and security purposes) Generating a stack trace is a relatively expensive process (though unlikely to be an issue in most 'exceptional' circumstances) Many logging frameworks will print the stack trace for you (ours does not and no, we can't change it easily) Printing the stack trace does not constitute error handling. It should be combined with other information logging and exception handling. What other reasons are there for avoiding printing a stack trace in your code?
I have seen a similar problem here for example , but i am not trying to acces to Java SE features.. I have a .jar file with the code of a bluetooth functionality.. I try to make a .jar package that works with Blackberry and Windows.. In both cases i use the javax.bluetooth.BluetoothConnectionException class. This class comes in the Blackberry SDK and in the BlueCove package to use Bluetooth in Windows... so the BlueCove package is included in the jar file.. When i try to use the .jar file with the Blackberry, i have the error mentioned in the title: Error!: Duplicate definition for 'javax.bluetooth.BluetoothConnectionException'.. My problem here is that i want to use a feature that comes in the Standard SDK from RIM, but there is another class with the same name and in the same package in the .jar file, and therefore, i get this error... Is there some way to make the BlackBerry application to look for this class in its own SDK instead of the .jar file? I think that i cannot / should not modify the package of any of the classes. Any ideas here? I would appreciate any. Thanks PS: I use the Eclipse plug-in for Blackberrry, in case that is usefull.

Also when I tried to recover data using the Recover Tool from the corrupt database, I was only able to recover 10% of it. The original DB size was 1.6 GB while the recovered database size was only 81 MB. I exported all the data from the corrupt database to a .sql file using the Recover Tool and then recreated database out of it by running this script against an H2 database. Is there something else that I am missing?
I am creating a Java service which will run within a web servlet container (probably Tomcat). One portion of the server will run on its own and will not be initiated by HTTP. I know that when an HTTP call causes an exception, the web container can call it again. I want to be sure that the part of the server which runs continuously will continue to run, even if it fails. I will handle whichever failures I can manually, but if it all fails I want something to restart it all. Are there any tools that can accomplish this easily? I am already using Spring and Tomcat, so if those can provide it, that is ideal. If not, then how about a good design pattern? Edit: To clarify, I have a web service which will run in Tomcat. I want to run a separate thread within that service and set it up such that when the thread ends or an un-handled exception occurs, Tomcat (or something else) detects the failure and restarts the web service. I know that typically web containers have threads start from some external call and thus handle failures from those threads. What I want is something which handles a background worker thread.
If an exception occurs in the service or controller, it is handled by spring's HandlerExceptionResolvers. However, if there is an exception in a .jsp processing (for example - PropertyNotFoundException, happens even with JSTL), then spring does not pass this through its exception handling mechanism. Further more, it is not considered an error 500, so the <error-page> configuration is not taken into account Instead, the exception is propagated to the servlet container. Which is fine, but I can't actually get the behaviour I want: show a (500) error page log the exception My current setup: the 500.jsp has isErrorPage=true all jsps include a common file, which has <%@ page errorPage="500.jsp" %> What happens is - the exception is not recorded anywhere. And the error page is not shown. Instead, the requested page is shown half-rendered. If I increase the buffer size (enough to reach the problematic piece of code), only then the error page is shown. (again, no logging) So, how do I achieve what I want? Without changing the buffer size, without using <c:catch>, and without ex.printStackTrace() in the error page)
We hit an extremely surprising exception today. Inside of a synchronized block, we call wait() and it throws IllegalMonitorStateException. What can cause this? This is happening in well-tested open source code: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/river/jtsk/trunk/src/com/sun/jini/jeri/internal/mux/Mux.java?view=markup#l222 We eliminated the obvious causes: are we synchronized on the right variable? Yes, it's muxLock is it a mutable variable? No, muxLock is final are we using any weird "-XX:" JVM flags that might affect monitor behavior? No, but we are launching the JVM embedded inside a C++ app via JNI. is this a strange JVM? No, it's Sun's 1.6.0_25 win/x64 JRE is this a known JVM bug? Can't find anything relevant at http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase So, I'm trying to think of more far-fetched explanations. could an uncaught out-of-memory error cause the monitor state to be screwed up? We're looking at this, but we're seeing no evidence of memory errors yet. UPDATE: (based on comment) I've also verified from the stacktrace and breakpoint that the thread is indeed inside the synchronized block when the exception is thrown. It's not the case that some other unrelated code is emitting the exception (unless something is REALLY confusing Eclipse!)
I appologise in advance for this question possibly being hard to interpret, but I'm trying to include the minimum information necessary (I doubt you want to be reading through 10 different classes looking for the error) I have been making a simple(ish) application in java, using swing for the GUI. Currently I have a JTable, JList and a JButton. When a row is double clicked in the table, it is added to the list. When the button is clicked, a customised fileVisitor walks through a (currently hard-coded) directory and populates the table with the files it was finding. The list does nothing so far. This all worked as expected. However, when the button is clicked, the whole application locks up for the ~15s it takes the fileVisitor to run. This is fine if a bit irritating. When the file tree walk ends, the application responds again (and the table updates all rows at once). So I decided to put the Files.walkFileTree call in its own thread. At first this appeared to be effective, as each file was added to the table model it was reflected in the table (that was set to call revalidate on a model change). However, if I double clicked an item while the file tree walk was in progess, it would hang with the message: java.lang.NullPointerException thrown from the UncaughtExceptionHandler in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" After reading up on swing a bit, I assumed it was due to my editing the table model from a thread that was not the AWT dispatch thread, and promptly put the lines that edit the table model in a SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable) block. However, this did not fix the issue. Weirdly (or possibly not, it seems weird to me), sometimes a double-click works, and it's only after 2 or 3 attempts that I cause the crash. My question is: what can be causing this? I can't see anything else obviously wrong, and all my googling points to Swings lack of thread-safety, and using the AWT dispatch thread (which I thought was what invokeLater does). Anyone know what's wrong? P.S. sorry again if anything's unclear, and that it's so long :P
So I've got a brand new PC with win7 64 bit on it. I'm trying to get up and running with android SDK and eclipse. I've done this before on other win7 32 bit machines and never had issues. But now on this new machine, I have installed JDK 1.7.0 (64 bit), I have installed eclipse indigo 64 bit, and I've installed r13 of the sdk from here. http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html But every time I try to launch the sdk manager (yes, I did get it installed with the "back" and "next" trick to make sure it found java) it fails to download the repository.xml file. The error I get 4 times is: Failed to fetch URL http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/repository.xml, reason: Invalid argument: connect Note that I did shut off mcafee firewall so I don't think that's the issue. I also tried the tricks mentioned many many places about trying with and without https://... I have a direct connection, so I don't believe I need a proxy at all. And I've verified that URL can load the xml into chrome. So I'm totally out of ideas now!!! Please help!
I am trying to setup my Service provider using OpenSAML2 libraries. I am trying to set up a servlet which would accept HttpRequest from user's browser and based on the request parameters I want to create a SAML Authentication request packet. I am able to create the SAML packet, however I want to Base64 encode the SAML so that I can redirect the user browser to the Identity provider server. In order to do that I am trying to marshall the SAML Authentication Request using 'org.opensaml.saml2.core.impl.AuthnRequestMarshaller#marshall(AuthnRequest)'. This works fine when I try it outside of the web server environment (standalone JAVA application). However when I run it as a servlet component I get an error saying "No marshaller available for {urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion}Issuer, child of {urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol}AuthnRequest", where Issuer is a component of the AuthnRequest object. I am using Tomcat 5.5.34 webserver. It would be nice if someone can help me figure out whats happening here. It would help others trying to write their own Service Providers as well. Surprisingly very less documentation is available for this. Thanks, Kaustubh
Hi guys : Whats the best way to debug the "classnotfound" Error in eclipse ? I have a standard setup .... Ant, eclipse, etc... and every once in a while, I do something to muck my build up . I've never quite come up with a system for figuring out exactly where it is that eclipse "looks" for class files --- and how to make sure that my builds work properly. Usually, on this project, I toggle the "builders" on and off (there is a Java builder, and an Ant builder checkbox in Properties->Builders), and build from the commandline using ant a few times --- eventually, eclipse gets synced back up and sees my class files.... So in general - my real question is - what is the right way to inspect and debug a java build in eclipse ? When you click "Run As-> Junit test" ... how and where does eclipse look for / execute the classes ?
I am running a Linux 2.6.38-10-server #46-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux and I have the following problem: 1) I log in ssh 2) I start a screen (using the screen command) 3) I start a java program " java -jar ../mlJar.jar > eval1" and pipe the output to eval1 4) I detach the screen (Ctrl+A, Crtl+D) 5) The program will run correctly unless I log-off 6) After logging off and when the java app tries to open a file it throws the following exception java.io.FileNotFoundException: /path/to/my/file.arff (No such file or directory) at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method) at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:120) at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:79) at java.io.FileReader.<init>(FileReader.java:41) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.utilities.InstancesUtility.openInstance(InstancesUtility.java:74) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.data.representations.complex.ComplexRepresentation.<init>(ComplexRepresentation.java:834) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.data.representations.complex.StrictMultiLabelRepresentation.<init>(StrictMultiLabelRepresentation.java:456) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.implementations.SequentialUCS.<init>(SequentialUCS.java:165) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.implementations.SequentialUCS.createNew(SequentialUCS.java:196) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.FoldEvaluator.evaluate(FoldEvaluator.java:153) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.implementations.global.AllMlTypes.main(AllMlTypes.java:69) Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException at gr.auth.ee.lcs.FoldEvaluator.loadFold(FoldEvaluator.java:211) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.FoldEvaluator.evaluate(FoldEvaluator.java:155) at gr.auth.ee.lcs.implementations.global.AllMlTypes.main(AllMlTypes.java:69) Which probably means that this happens because the JVM has "lost" it's access rights to the folder. Can anyone help with how to solve the problem. In other versions of linux this doesn't happen. Is there any configuration in Linux that can sort this out? Thanks!
I am having an error which I cannot figure out. Basically, NOTHING has changed on the web app that is running (apart from maybe an influx of data). And it has suddenly died. When going to the site, I see a HTTP Status 500 error, with a NullPointerException.

(I've accidentally deleted the gist that I'm referring to in this question; sorry for the inconvenience.) The Question I'm trying to use the Servlet 3.0 API to deploy Jersey root resources (those annotated with the @Path annotation) following the Jersey's user guide. I've created a gist at GitHub containing two classes: Foo.java which is a subclass of Application that exposes Bar.java (the resource class) through its getClasses() method. (There is a pom.xml too, so anyone can try this out for herself/himself easily.) However, when I try to deploy the packaged war to a Jetty 8.0.x instance I get the output available here at pastebin. Foo.java gets called, its getClasses() method gets called too while Bar.java is never invoked. I can reach Jetty's welcome page at http://localhost:8080/, however I neither can reach http://localhost:8080/foo or http://localhost:8080/foo/bar. The latter two results in the following error: Not Found ERROR custom 404 page What could be the problem? Am I doing something wrong here? The Answer Given the WAR I've used (test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war) my application path became http://localhost:8080/test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/foo/bar instead of http://localhost:8080/foo/bar. See what I did there? Good. Engrave this in your mind people or lose 3-to-5 precious hours of your life!

In recent years I have been working on web applications written in Java using the Spring MVC framework. The projects have good test coverage with JUnit & Selenium. However on two occasions errors in the Spring Configuration have got through the testing process. In one case a change was made to a parent bean in controllerContext.xml which also required a change to the two inheriting beans. But the required change was only made to one of the two inheriting beans. The error was only visible in a small, but critical, part of the Web application. Selenium UA tests were later extended to check this directly in the Web App. prior to deployment, but the damage had already been done as the error made it into the live environment. In another case a property required to set the data format was not being injected properly via the applicationContext.xml. The only visible error was in the date format of a generated report downloaded from the web app. Difficult to test with Selenium. One of the advantages of using Spring MVC is the ability to set the injected objects in your JUnit tests (i.e. a mock object), but this doesn't tell you what you are actually going to get injected when the Application is running in the live environment. The answer may be integration testing, however setting up & running integration testing has proved to be difficult in the past ... but that's another question ... So, I'd be really interested in learning how people have tried to catching possible errors introduced into Spring configuration files. So my question is: What is the best way to test for errors in the Spring Configuration?
I am downloading long files from Amazon S3 server. I log excpetions to my server DB if any occure. What I see is large number of exceptions is java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out I thought this is occur when user is in bad/poor internet coverage but I wonder if user is in bad coverage area then why that is logging on server?(As this also done via internet). Any body know reason? The line at which this exception occurs every time is while ((numRead = inputStream.read(mBuffer)) >= 0) How I can handle that exception? I am thinking that when exception occur then I should again make a try about no of time e.g 5 time by calling inputStream.read(mBuffer); Is I am thinking correct? Is after read time out exception occur the inputstream will be valid to use again? Will calling inputStream.read(mBuffer); will be resume from the last stream readed? Thanks
I am beginning to learn Java and writing my first utility classes in java which are supposed to go in production. I am somewhat lost when it is coming to dealing with exceptions. Is there some ballpark figure on how many try statements are there in a given lines of code? How much fraction of code is supposed to deal with exceptions..any plugin for Eclipse? Is it best practice to include 3-4 statements in a try block and catch exception or include 10-12 lines in a try block and afterwards include 2-3 catch statements catching different kind of exceptions say ones throws by File related or by my own classes or some other 3rd party classes..? The former is a bit displeasing to eyes and it is bloating code so much.. Is this common practice to only and only surround that code in try block which can throw exception or it's fine to tag along surrounding code as well inside try say how the file handle is being used etc.. Any pointers..?
So, we use Netbeans 6.9.1, push our code to a SVN server (dev) and run local webservers (Tomcat) that connect to MySQL on a DEV machine. We can run in debug mode and step through our code. However, we then take our WAR file, push to a production machine (on a production database). This machine is completely separate from dev. But we run into constant problems. Things like null id in Hibernate when we have triple-checked all columns, etc. What we need is a way to attach a debugger to a PRODUCTION user and step through the code. What are our options? Thanks for any advice. EDIT I wanted to post a little more information. Thanks for those that have offered suggestions. First, our production server hosts 3 apps (along with the prod db). The app we are having the most problems with just has one user and the data is almost identical to what we have in dev. We are having transaction problems with JDBC and can't find out where they are coming from.
First off, here is what is working, and then I'll describe what is not: Using SWIG, we have taken some third party code, and created the Java and C wrapper source. A jar file of the Java classes, and a shared library of the C wrapper code was created. We have a Java codebase that loads the shared library, and is able to invoke the native code as needed. This is running on Sun HostSpot JVM 1.5.0.14. No worries here. Now, this is not working: Using the same JVM, jar file with of the Java wrapper code, and same shared library described above, I am trying to use Jython to do some scripting. The CLASSPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment vars are set correctly. From Jython, I am able to run java.lang.System.loadLibrary(...), and load the shared library without error. However, when the first native method from this library that is invoked for a Java object in my Jython script, I get an UnsatisfiedLinkError from the JVM. I ran nm on the shared library, and I see that the method in question is present in the library (with the name mangling for native methods as described in the JNI spec). So, the question is, what could be stopping the JVM from resolving the method name? I've been through the JNI spec, and I see that a library can be unloaded by the GC. Could that be happening before I invoke the method? What else can cause this to fail?
When I restart my app after its been killed (after an hour or so by android or if I kill it via task killer), the app crashes with the following message: 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): FATAL EXCEPTION: main 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{ com.test.testapp /com.test.testapp.TestingActivity}: java.lang.NullPointerException 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2663) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2679) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.app.ActivityThread.access$2300(ActivityThread.java:125) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:2033) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:123) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4627) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:521) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:868) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:626) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at com.test.testapp.TestingActivity.onCreate(TestingActivity.java:178) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1047) 10-23 09:07:41.120: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(647): at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2627) I have a timer in that activity and I thought maybe it had something to do with that thread but even if I remove the timer it still crashes.

Question about the m2 eclipse plugin. Currently I have "Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers", the most recent update. I have the m2 eclipse plugin installed, and have started a normal java project. I then converted this to a maven project via "right click->configure->convert to to maven project" This appears to work, a pom.xml is created, the project converts, and everything is well and good. The issue starts when I do anything to this project. In the maven settings for the project "Right client on project -> maven" there are several options that are behaving strangely, updating maven configuration will change the default JDK for the project (JDK7) to j2SE-1.5..., which was never installed on the machine, and of course is not found. Also code completion, and and error checking is not working in the editor. Example: params.put("some_string", ); This should render "red" for compilation errors because there is no second argument to put(), however this checks out as okay according to the eclipse editor. I have some done some research on this issue, and from what I can gather from Google, it appears that there are some issues with m2eclipse and this distro of eclipse however there is nothing to resolve this. Is anybody else having similar problems, or does anybody have any idea how to resolve this? Please let me know if the is any other information I can provide, I didn't want to just paste my settings.xml into stack overflow. Note: I have my settings.xml configured in Eclipse, and have specifies which jdk to use (7) System information: Maven version: 3.0.3 Eclipse Version: Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers Version All eclipse plugins have the most recent versions installed as of this post date, and there are no XML integrity errors, or anything of the sort.
I've got a database that is mirrored using SQL 2008 Mirroring. I have a java application, running on Linux, using the Microsoft SQL type 4 JDBC drivers. I have this setup duplicated as a QA environment. On my QA environment, when I manually fail over the database, providing a successful connection had already been made, the failover was completely transparent. I did not have to implement anything in order to get the application to talk to the new Principle (Old mirror). In the live environment however, the connections stop working once I have manually failed over. There are quite a few things different between the live and QA environments, but not anything I'd consider fundamental to this process, communication between databases is all very localised in both situations and there are no firewalls (Except the ones built into Windows Server 2008) between my java app and the Windows boxes running SQL 2008. Does anyone have any ideas about how I can go about diagnosing this issue? Or can anyone tell me how this failover transparency occurs so I can work out how to diagnose this myself?
i'm trying to see an old EJB3 project that i did at school but the only thing i can see is the index.jsp on the browser. The error i get is: SEVERE: Class [ Lse/ernesto/databaseStuff/DbManagerLocal; ] not found. Error while loading [ class se.ernesto.client.UpdateEventServlet ] The DBManagerLocal is an interface for a stateless session bean. The UpdateEventServlet is a servlet in the Dynamic Web Project. Note that i have added the EJB Project to the WEB Project's build path. The other jsp files are in the WEB-INF folder in my Dynamic Web Project. But it seems it doesn't find the servlets which are responsible for loading these jsp files. This is weird because the project was working before (1 year ago) Since then i updated to OSX Lion, i don't know if there's an issue with the new OS and EJB3. The project is composed by a Dynamic Web Project, a EJB3 Project and an EAR Project, all of those are deployed via Eclipse in a Glassfish server. Has anyone run into this problem? Thanks a lot in advance.
I am attempting to get SimpleARToolKit in the Processing.org IDE on my Mac. I have downloaded the SimpleARToolKit and JMyron files. I was getting some JMyron errors, but I moved the Library files and now those errors have gone away. The problem I am having now is when I try to run demo01.pde from the SimpleARToolKit, I get an error that says: UnsatisfiedLinkError: no JARToolKit in java.library.path Exception in thread "Animation Thread" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no JARToolKit in java.library.path at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1754) at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:823) at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:1045) at net.sourceforge.jartoolkit.core.JARToolKit.(JARToolKit.java:40) at pARToolKit.SimpleARToolKit.(SimpleARToolKit.java:36) at demo01.setup(demo01.java:44) at processing.core.PApplet.handleDraw(PApplet.java:1608) at processing.core.PApplet.run(PApplet.java:1530) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:680) The demo is crashing on this line: ar = new SimpleARToolKit(this, capWidth, capHeight); I have found a few other websites that seem to be asking the same question, but none of them are in English and through using Google Translate, none of them seem to resolve the issue. Update: This is not yet resolved but I have an update: I found jARToolKit on SourceForge.net Inside the jARToolKit.zip folder I found jARToolKit.jar file and copied it to my Mac/Library/Java/Extensions/ folder Now when I run the code, the error says "no jartoolkit in java.library.path" (note the lowercase "jartoolkit") - as opposed to the original "no JARToolKit in java.library.path". If I remove the .jar file from the Extensions folder, the original error appears again, so this makes me think that I am on the right track, but still missing something.
I am using several threads to do some heavy (and error-prone) processing on a large data set. I require all threads to finish execution, regardless of whether they throw an exception or terminate normally (no value is returned), before the program can continue. I am using a CountDownLatch to achieve this, and an ExecutorService to actually run the jobs. I want the worker threads (let's call them JobManager-s for the sake of argument) to notify the latch even if they throw an exception. A JobManager can take anywhere between a second and an hour to complete, and may fail at any time. The idea is to invoke the "finalizer" method of JobManager if an exception is thrown. Now, the ExecutorService likes to catch exceptions or to conceal the true origin of the ones it does not. I have though of a few ways around this, neither of which is satisfactory: Use ExecutorService#execute(Runnable r) rather than submit(Runnable r). I can do that since I do not care about the return value of the JobManager. I have provided a custom ThreadFactory, which attaches an UncaughtExceptionHandler to each newly created thread. The problem with this approach is that when UncaughtExceptionHandler#uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e) is invoked, t's Runnable is of type ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker, and not of type JobManager, which prevents me from invoking the "finalizer" method. Use a custom ExecutorService and override the afterExecute(Runnable r, Throwable t) method. This suffers from the same problem as 1. Wrap the whole JobManager#doWork() in a catch statement and use the return value to indicate if an exception was thrown. I can then submit the jobs and use FutureTask#get() to decide if an exception was thrown. I do not like this solution because I feel return codes the wrong tool when you have an elaborate exception mechanism. Moreover, get() will wait (unless interrupted), which means I cannot handle errors in other threads immediately. Get rid of the CountDownLatch. Store all Futures in a list and repeatedly poke in until I am satisfied with the states. This might work, but feels like a dirty hack. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

My Java version: java version "1.6.0_20" OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.9.10) (rhel-1.23.1.9.10.el5_7-x86_64) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0-b09, mixed mode) I just downloaded Weka today from the link on their downloads page, so there shouldn't be anything wrong with it. Now I know that this would normally be because it can't find weka.jar, but I promise you that it is right there at: /weka/weka.jar. And I can also promise that both the /weka directory and weka.jar have execute permissions. Please help!
I have seen & read over 10 similar questions but am still unable to figure it out. I am using windows7 / Eclipse Helios Service Release 1 / mysql-connector-java-5.1.13-bin.jar. Everything worked until yesterday, and noW I get this error. I am not aware of anything I did that could have caused this (but maybe still...). There are no duplicates of this file on my system (nor any other mysql-connector-*). I am not sure where eclipse is looking for this file, it is sitting under my projects \WebContent\WEB-INF\lib folder with several other .jarS. looking at the "project" menu -> properties and then "Java Build Path" on the left I see it as one of the libraries under "Web App Libraries" inside the "Libraries" tab. Do I need to add it to the CLASSPATH system environment variable ? (and if so - what would be . in that context ?) is there a way for me to see (by way of debug) what is the actual path being searched by the class loader? -=-=- More info following comments by @javagirl Q: where did you get the exception? compilation, building, running as java app, under tomcat/etc running? A: its a runtime exception I get on the eclipse console running tomcat6. Q: which build tool are you using, ant? A: AFAIK none. just press play or debug on eclipse. and connect to tomcat from a browser. Q: is this jar located in the final built package? A: I don't know how to answer this, but if you can tell me where to look I will. that said I guess the answer is no because search only finds the single instance of the JAR I mentioned. Q: if you running it under the servlet container like tomcat you probably need to put it in the tomcat/lib folder A: I am running under tomcat - but not sure where I should actually find this lib folder. -=-=- can someone please guide me step by step with resolving this ?
When invoking a method in server side I can get a list of errors or warnings if something is wrong with some of the parameters, or a correct answer if everything is ok. For example, I send an object defined at client side to the server, where I have the logic to validate if that object is ok, so I can return a list of errors and warnings related to the object definition to the client so he can correct them properly, or, if the validation goes through, something saying that everything was ok. Possible solution: I could return a List of Errors, so, when everything goes ok the list is empty, and when I have some errors or warnings I can handle them and show them to the user. Is this approach correct? Is there any design pattern to do this in a better way? My background is a client-server architecture and I will be using EJBs invoked from client side using Business Delegate pattern to design the communication.
I'm trying to write a program that solves for the reduced row echelon form when given a matrix. Basically what I'm doing is writing a program that solves systems of equations. However, due to the fact that there are times when I need to do division to result in repeating digits (such as 2/3 which is .66666...) and java rounds off to a certain digit, there are times when a pivot should be 0 (meaning no pivot) is something like .0000001 and it messes up my whole program. My first question is if I were to have some sort of if statement, what is the best way to write something like "if this number is less than .00001 away from being an integer, then round to that closest integer". My second question is does anyone have any ideas on more optimal ways of handling this situation rather than just put if statements rounding numbers all over the place. Thank you very much.
I have a (REST) application that handles CRUD operations initiated by a 3rd party, and basically my problem is in returning an easily understood error message in the case of a constraint violation. I'm using Hibernate (though JPA solutions would be better) and the ConstraintViolationException it throws is not terribly useful, it doesn't even have the name of the constraint that has been violated. I've so far been returning constraintViolation.getSQLException().getMessage() which returns a half decent message along the lines of Duplicate entry '<value>' for key 2. The problem is a new requirement to improve the error returned to include which entity failed to commit as well as the value (and what kind of failure it was as a custom error code; DUPLICATE_VALUE, MISSING_FOREIGN_KEY, or something like that). Since the above string comes from the SQLException I assume it depends on the DB/driver, so while I could pick out '' from that string and search through every field in every object I just committed to try to find the right one it doesn't exactly seem the robust option (especially as we need to support multiple databases). So is there any way I can find this information based on the information at hand? (Which is basically just the ConstraintViolationException w/SQLException and the object I tried to persist).
I have (java) code that creates and populates tables in a derby database, using text files as source data. I'm currently running it out of eclipse indigo, on Win7, and it works fine. I have other code in that program that, based on user choice, creates the database into which that data is to go. I can't get that part to work. It uses 'jdbc:derby:x\y;create=true' as its connection string; it throws an exception from DriverManager.getConnection(connectionString, properties) saying "The database directory blah\blah\x\y exists; however, the it does not contain the expected 'service.properties' file. Perhaps...' and some more irrelevant stuff. Before I run this, I delete the directories x and y, and then perform a refresh on the eclipse project that my code is in. These directories currently live in the same directory as my eclipse project. After I run my code, directories x and y have both been created, but not my database. If I delete the directories, open a command prompt, set my default to the directory that is to contain x, start ij, and use the connect statement with the same connection string given above, it creates the directories and the database. THEN my program will populate the database as expected, no errors. I have also tried creating the database directly in the workspace directory that my project is in (i.e., y without a parent directory of x), with the same result, so I don't think it's the slash in the database name spec. So I would like to know what I might be doing wrong that prevents that program from creating the database, just like the 'connect' statement in ij will do.
I am getting DeadObjectException in my code. Below, I describe my setup, and what I have tried to fix the issue. A Service S is started from Application A. Activity B (from another application) communicates with that service using Messenger and IBinder interfaces. This activity is also started from the same service. On a button press inside this activity, I am supposed to send a message back to the service. I frequently get DeadObjectException on button press. I understand that the most likely cause for this is - system killed and restarted the service, and the activity has old reference to it. Beyond this, I haven't found much information online. This is what I have tried: I used a startForeground() in service, and I could see that the service was running (notification in notification area) continuously. I still got the exception. On a system reboot, I do not get this exception for a while. The exception is intermittent. I do not have a 100% repro. However, in the following scenario, I always get the exception: Start app A (thi also start the service S). Start activity B, everything works fine. Restart the service by redeploying app A. Navigate to activity B. The exception happens. At this point, if I restart activity B, the exception disappears. This led me to conclude that if I made sure that the activity B is fresh every time the service starts, this exception would disappear. I then tried to deliver a murdering intent to activity B, prior to starting it. (Activity has a BroadcastReceiver, and calls finish() in onReceive()). The problem is, if the activity pauses, Intents are not delivered to it. Also, I see onDestroy() being hit in a nutshell, because Android manages activity life cycle, intents are not guaranteed to be delivered to it. I also tried extending a BaseActivity as mentioned in this stackoverflow question. I also tried setting FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK (in addition to usual FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK), with no better results. Now, I feel as if I am out of options. Has anyone faced similar problems? Is there something I can try? Is it possible to catch the exception and then rebind the service?
Note: This question refers to Jsoup 1.6.1 I need to parse several documents using Jsoup, but I have noticed the memory builds up after some time. Using heap dumps and a memory analyzer, I have tracked down the problem to Jsoup's Tokeniser class, which stores an ArrayList of ParseError's. In the heap dump, there were over 5 million of ParseError objects stored, at 56 bytes each. Looking at the source code, I noticed a variable in org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser which allows error tracking to be turned off. Following the flow of the calls, I can not see any call to turn it off, despite there being a method to do so. The class not being public, I am forced to modify the source code and build it from source. Is there a method I can call or a property I can set to effectively disable error tracking in the Tokeniser without having to modify the source code?
I have been developing a Web Service for some time now on my Eclipse IDE and after I finished it I exported it to a Server running Windows server 2008 R2. After deploying it successfully I run into runtime errors : 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] java.lang.ClassCastException: org.jboss.ws.core.jaxrpc.client.ServiceFactoryImpl cannot be cast to javax.xml.rpc.ServiceFactory 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at javax.xml.rpc.ServiceFactory.newInstance(ServiceFactory.java:63) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.jsp.GetDocuments_jsp._jspService(GetDocuments_jsp.java:86) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase.service(HttpJspBase.java:70) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:717) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service(JspServletWrapper.java:369) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile(JspServlet.java:322) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service(JspServlet.java:249) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:717) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:290) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.jboss.web.tomcat.filters.ReplyHeaderFilter.doFilter(ReplyHeaderFilter.java:96) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:235) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke(StandardWrapperValve.java:235) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invoke(StandardContextValve.java:191) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.jboss.web.tomcat.security.SecurityAssociationValve.invoke(SecurityAssociationValve.java:183) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.jboss.web.tomcat.security.JaccContextValve.invoke(JaccContextValve.java:95) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.jboss.web.tomcat.security.SecurityContextEstablishmentValve.process(SecurityContextEstablishmentValve.java:126) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.jboss.web.tomcat.security.SecurityContextEstablishmentValve.invoke(SecurityContextEstablishmentValve.java:70) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHostValve.invoke(StandardHostValve.java:127) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:102) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.jboss.web.tomcat.service.jca.CachedConnectionValve.invoke(CachedConnectionValve.java:158) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngineValve.invoke(StandardEngineValve.java:109) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:330) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor.process(Http11Processor.java:829) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol$Http11ConnectionHandler.process(Http11Protocol.java:599) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.JIoEndpoint$Worker.run(JIoEndpoint.java:451) 16:03:39,358 ERROR [STDERR] at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) This happens when I try to access the Web Methods, in this example GetDocuments is the Web Method. The client is using JSP to create Binding Stubs to communication with the Service. These stubs are automatic generate by the Eclipse IDE. I don't know too much else about Web Services or how look into these problem further as it the errors do not point to any real class in my project. My big question would be why I received no errors until I exported the project. I was thinking that it might be an issue with THe JRE or compiler but they are the same on both platforms. I would appreciate any help.
My problem is somewhat like the question here and here, but none of those answer can apply to my situation. I am running tomcat inside Eclipse, and my project has some quartz job that run by schedule. Those quartz job meets null pointer exception very often (since they must parse documents from an untrusted source) and surely the team who are working with those jobs can't fix them right away. The result is that Eclipse pop up debug tab every now and then, usually take up focus so that I can't look what happen in console. Moreover, when Eclipse meet the exception, it pop out to take focus out of the program I currently work in (browser, email,...). It is very annoying. Can I simply skip all the null pointer exceptions (since the fail of the jobs doesn't affect my program anyway) or is there a way to keep the focus on the console tab, and keep Eclipse doesn't complain everytime an exception pop out? I'm very thankful for any possible solution. UPDATE: I'm using Eclipse Helios with few plugins.
I'm trying to deploy Liferay 6.0.6 on an already existing Glassfish 3.1.1 installation. I have followed the Liferay Administration Guide perfectly and while I can deploy the war, it doesn't do it right.

The ViewExpiredException is being handled by a redirect to the login screen. The problem is that the exception is still logged, and the customer would strongly like to have the server.log exception-free. While it may be a questionable requirement in this case, I still have to make it happen. We use Mojarra and deploy on JBoss EAP 5.1 The MyFaces approach does not help as I obviously cannot wrap the MyFacesServlet using Mojarra I could not apply the advice given in the JBoss JSF guide to wrap the Faces servlet as I cannot find the jsf-integration-deployer-jboss-beans.xml anywhere. I cannot get the approach proposed by Ed Burns to work either. I guess the reason is that it is targeted at JSF2 for I cannot find the javax.faces.context.ExceptionHandlerFactory in my jars. Making the matter worse, I am quite new to JSF, so I have to rely on detailed guidance, in search of which I have found the above approaches but failed to apply them. Thank you
Eclipse is giving me a few problems. After a cold start and the loading of android libs, Eclipse underline the import statements or says that java.lang.Object couldn't be found. Closing it and reopening often fix the problem. If it doesn't, another close-open fix it definitely. But it shows at each cold-start. It also gives "The type java.lang.Enum cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files" "The project cannot be build until build path errors are resolved" But if i restart the build path errors and the enum problem are not show any more(sometimes the enum proble got fixed some time after eclipse's loading finished) "Project 'xxx' is missing required source folder: 'gen' " that should be generated automatically generated while building, and still restarting will fix them In addition, in many projects, while building or cleaning, eclipse says that it couldn't delete the bin/. directory. I noticed that that directory is read-only, and if i try to remove the attribute(even from dos), it immediately return to read-only. This problems aren't show-stoppers, i still can code and i still can get my apps exported, but it is quite annoying to have to restart eclipse a few times before being able to use it(and eclipse isn't that fast at opening), and i would really know how to fix it. I searched in the net a bit, but i dind't found nothing useful or that worked. Is there a way to fix them? I didn't "unistalled"(it is just stored in a directory) Eclipse, since i should then reinstall android sdk, mercurial plugin, and re download and set up a few libraries i use in quite all my project, and i really hope there is another way. final notes: everything works when this problems doesn't show: the app works, logcat too, the right device is used to install the app, so i think java and android sdks are installed just right
What exception to throw when a property or a method being accessed is temporarily unavailable (as it makes no sense in the current state of the object)? Following is a semi-illustrative example coming into my mind, don't take it too serious, try to consider the question itself if you get it. A fraction class having numerator and denominator read-and-write properties and quotient read-only property. If denominator does not equal 0 then quotient is to return numerator/denominator else it is to throw an exception saying that the property value is not defined/available for the current state of the object (please don't offer ArithmeticException or DivideByZeroException, the question is not about arithmetics, it is closer to the finite state machines subject). Another example can be an object of a class doing some complex calculations in a parallel thread and providing the result as a field - it can throw the exception if the calculations are not complete yet. I am interested in answers for Java and .Net platforms.
I am attempting to run a tomcat application, but when I try to go to the application I get: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class ysl.util.Utils ysl.util.Utils.executeQuery(Utils.java:186) ysl.util.Utils.getProperty(Utils.java:395) ysl.util.Utils.getProperty(Utils.java:383) ysl.util.YslMachineProperties.init(YslMachineProperties.java:76) ysl.util.YslMachineProperties.getTomcatImagesDirectory(YslMachineProperties.java:109) org.apache.jsp.YSLLogin_jsp._jspService(YSLLogin_jsp.java:70) org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase.service(HttpJspBase.java:98) org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service(JspServletWrapper.java:328) org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile(JspServlet.java:315) org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service(JspServlet.java:265) javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:803) I have found many references to this problem on the web - most say there was a class available when the application was compiled that is not available at run time and that I need to add something to the java classpath to find it. But how can I determine what class is missing? The error message says that the Utils class could not be initialized, yet the stacktrace shows that we are into the second method in the class, so I would think that the class was already initialized. And certainly that is not the class whose definition can't be found, since we have line number information in the stacktrace. The method which is triggering the error looks like this: static public ResultSet executeQuery(String queryString) throws SQLException { return dbConnPool.executeQuery(queryString); Any suggestions?
So, to explain this, I'll start out by going through the application stack. The system is running JSP with jQuery on top, talking through a controller layer with a service layer, which in turn utilizes a persistence layer implemented in Hibernate. Now, traditionally, errors like having overlapping contracts has been handled through throwing exceptions up through the layers until they're translated into an error message for the user. Now I have an object that at any given time can only be tied to one contract. At the moment, when I save a contract, I look at all of these objects and check if they're already covered by an existing contract. However, since multiple clients can be saving at any given time, this introduces the risk of getting past the check on two separate contracts, leading to one object being tied to two contracts at the same time. To combat this, the idea was to use a queue, put objects into the queue from the main thread, and then have a separate thread take them out one by one, saving them. However, here's the problem. For one, I would like the user to know that the saving is currently happening, for another, if by accident the scenario before happens, and two contracts with the same object covering the same time is in the queue, the second one will fail, and this needs to be sent back to the user. My initial attempt was to keep data fields on the object put into the queue, and then check against those in a blocking wait, and then throw an exception or report success based on what happens. That deadlocked the system completely. Anyone able to point me in the right direction with regards to techniques and patterns I should be using for this?
I have a webapp built using spring framework. I'm trying to deploy this to Tomcat6 using Eclipse. Everytime i make a change to jsp file, I had to clean the build, publish it & then start the server. I believe, we don't have to do all these steps for JSP changes. If i just publish the files, when the server is running, i get the below exceptions SEVERE: Exception sending context destroyed event to listener instance of class org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/springframework/web/context/ContextCleanupListener SEVERE: Exception sending context destroyed event to listener instance of class org.springframework.web.util.Log4jConfigListener java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/springframework/util/Log4jConfigurer And the war file is not getting deployed in server. If I make a change to JSP file & then click restart in eclipse, it sometimes publish the files & then start the server. But in some cases, it restarts the server & then publishes the files (in which case i got the above mentioned exceptions & the war file was not getting deployed). Ideal way that it works is, Stop the server, publish the contents & then start the server. I hate to do this every time i make a simple jsp change. Is there any alternate one click process to do this?

I'm building a web app that chunk outputs back to the client in Java netty. I've read and searched the internet and found the following resources: HTTP Made Really Easy Error code redirect when returning a response with chunked encoding? HTTP 1.1 RFC 2616 and to summarize, I am lead to believe that trailer-headers with "Location" should be respected regardless of the http response and or prior headers. However after some blackbox testing on Firefox and Chrome. Neither browser respects the trailing header. So my question is first of all have I missed something? Secondly, what would be the ideal solution to deal with errors in chunked response? I am only currently aware of using javascripts in the middle of a response. and finally, am I wrong in believing HTTP Location headers should be respected regardless of http response code? The specification as I linked above made no mention it must be 3xx headers and in fact mentioned 201 headers as a possible case for Location as well but none of the major browsers respect it.

I'm following this guide trying to get a database for my chrome packaged app: http://code.google.com/p/gwt-mobile-webkit/wiki/DataServiceUserGuide I have added gwt-html5-database.jar to my classpath (it shows up under Referenced Libraries), I put <inherits name="com.google.code.gwt.database.Html5Database" /> in my gwt.xml. I created MyDataService.java in the .client package, it contains: package com.example.myproject.client; import com.google.code.gwt.database.client.service.*; @Connection(name = "myDatabase", version = "1.0", description = "My Database", maxsize = 10000) public interface MyDataService extends DataService { @Update("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS testtable (" + "id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, " + "adate INTEGER") void initDatabase(VoidCallback callback); } In my main class Test.java (in client package), I have package com.example.myproject.client; import com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint; import com.google.gwt.core.client.GWT; public class Levels implements EntryPoint { MyDataService dbService = GWT.create(MyDataService.class); public void onModuleLoad() { } } I believe I followed the instructions exactly, yet every time I run my app it doesn't work and says [ERROR] [Test] Failed to create an instance of 'com.example.myproject.client.Test' via deferred binding If I remove the MyDataService dbService = GWT.create(MyDataService.class);, it loads, so I think the problem is there. Any ideas?
I deployed a new version of one of my apps yesterday. I had a couple of ClassCastExceptions reported on the market dashboard this morning. The exceptions were happening because my java code was using findViewById to retrieve an element which I was casting to a Button. This was raising an exception as the element retrieved was in fact a LinearLayout. To troubleshoot this I took a copy of my latest generated R file from eclipse and saved it in a text file. I cleaned the project and took a new copy of R and compared them. The ids associated with some of the widgets were indeed different. The id of the button had been the id of the LinearLayout. I assume that deploying this cleaned project to production will now fix this issue. My question is how did my code run locally with this disconnect between the R file and the xml? I will make sure to run a clean in future before I deploy, but this seems like a bug.
Is there a way to have an JUnit Rule or something similar that gives every failing test a second chance, just by trying to run it once again. Background: I have a large Set of Selenium2-WebDriver tests written with JUnit. Due to a very aggressive timing (only short wait periods after the clicks) some tests (1 out of 100, and always a different one) can fail because the server sometimes responds a bit slower. But I can not make the wait period so long that it is definitely long enough, because then the tests will take for ever.) -- So I think it is acceptable for this use case that a test is green even if it needs a second try. Of course it would be better to have a 2 out of 3 majority (repeat a failing test 3 times, and take them as correct, if two of the tests are correct), but this would be a future improvement.
I'm working in a Java ear application with a web application module. In this module there is a class that calls other web application (hosted in the same application server - Glassfish 2.1), through a HttpUrlConnection. The problem is... When I click on the button which calls the method to invoke the other web application, it works fine. But, when I open too many tags on browser, and click fast on the same button. This is, when I call the method often (to invoke the other web application). The method hangs on the line HttpUrlConnection.getStatusCode(). I searched about this on Google... I has tried put the property setRequestProperty("Connection", "Close"), and the property setReadTimeout(5000). But it does not work. I tried to put a semaphore control on the method (which calls the other web application), so each call is independent of the others calls (I broke the simultaneity). I do not know what is the problem exactly. But when I call the HttpUrlConnection.getStatusCode() too many times the method hangs forever (it does not return, and it does not throw any exception). I'm doing a POST HTTP call. And I'm using JDK 6.

Explicitly adding any combination of JPA libraries (EclipseLink, Persistence, etc.) does nothing to stop the error.

In Netbeans->Project properties->Libraries->Processor(tab) it listed eclipselink (JPA2.0) and EclipseLink-ModelGen(JPA 2.0). Once I removed those it worked. Netbeans adds them automatically when you create an entity. I'm running Netbeans 7.0.1. Thanks for everybody's help.

I have a maven project in netbeans 6.9.1, in there a junit 4.4 test class. In netbeans context menu I can "clean and build" my project and in output I can see, that my test class was found and run by surefire.

I just can't figure it out, why i get this error. It is not always shown, but once it appears, my application refuses to accept connections (can't create new Socket-Threads, and also other threads i create in my JAVA-application for some of them i use ThreadPool). top and htop shows me, there is ~ 900 MB of 2048MB used. and there is also enough heap memory, about 200MB free. cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max outputs: 1196032 and also, everything worked fine few days ago, it's a multiplayer-online game, and we had over 200 users online(~500 threads in total). But now even with 80 users online(~200 threads) after 10 min or few hours my application gets somehow broken with this OutOfMemoryError. In this case i do restart my application and again it works only for this short period of time. I am very curious about, what if JVM act strangely on VPS, since other VPS on the same physical machine do also use JVM. Is that even possible? Is there some sort of limit by provider what is not visible to me? Or is there some sort of server attack? I should also mention, by the time this error occours, sometimes munin fails to log the data for about only 10 min. Looking at graph-images, there is just white-space, like munin is not working at all. And again there is about 1 GB memory free as htop tells me by that time. It might be also we case, i somehow produced a bug in my application. And start getting this error after I've done update. But even so, where do i begin the debugging ?
I'm using Spring (3.0.5.RELEASE) to create & manage some beans and am getting some very bizarre runtime errors. The first time I ran the code, I was using slf4j-api-1.5.11, and I got the error that is shown below. I did a quick perusing online, and it looks like the MessageFormatter.format(String,Object,Object) method was not added to SLF4J until version 1.6. So it was obvious to me that somewhere in my dependency graph I had some component (Spring, Camel, or a dozen other possibilities) depending on 1.6+ version of SLF4J. I removed 1.5.11 from my build path and replaced it with 1.6.2, and re-built. Still getting the same error. I've check the class file in the 1.6.2 Jar and it definitely contains that method. I've checked my class path settings, my Ivy setting (which I am using for dependency management), and I've even try cleaning the project (Eclipse) and running from a clean state. I was beginning to think that this might be an "Eclipse thing". But I'm packaging this into a WAR and deploying to Tomcat; Eclipse has nothing to do with it. SEVERE: Exception sending context initialized event to listener instance of class org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'messagehandler' defined in ServletContext resource [/WEB-INF/spring-config.xml]: Instantiation of bean failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException: Could not instantiate bean class [com.tms.relay.web.RelayWebIngestMessageHandler]: Constructor threw exception; nested exception is java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.slf4j.helpers.MessageFormatter.format(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/slf4j/helpers/FormattingTuple Any ideas? Online searching hasn't turned up any recommendations except the obvious (update the Jar). Thanks in advance!
I was able to make my project work with Maven, GWT (with mojo plugin), GWTP, Hibernate and everything else, however, it appears that Eclipse goings crazy. Randomly, sometimes it simply stop to recognize the classes, I try to run a class called "Test", for example, and he accuses error in the console, saying that this class was not found. Also, happens sometimes the classes are outdated, for some reason. Has anyone faced this kind of problem? Thanks in advance. [EDIT] look like it happens when I do a mvn clean install, and after a lot of refreshes, close and reopen eclipse, clean project and all that stuff, it works again.. [EDIT2] The problem occurs when I use mvn command externally and the Maven plugin for eclipse, the "target" directory becomes full of trash, and everything goings crazy. So, the solution is the answer from @icfantv. I do what he said and everything works. Another tip is to put attention in Java compile version that eclipse use... sometimes the maven set the project settings to use java 1.5 standart, and things like annotations stop working. Hope this edit make question better explained.
i'm migrating an application from jDev 10.3.1.4 (Using Equivalent version of OC4J and Toplink 3.0) to the latest to jDev 11.2.1. I'm encountering a lot of problems. First of all a general question, are there some in depth migration guides?This looks like is gonna be a total pain in the ass (Sorry for the expression) Now some more precise question. i have errors in offline database files. I get the message: WARNING: Offline Database file does not exist for file "TIPO_STAG.table" for every single offline database file. I have configured my database connection, but i don't know what is happening. i have the following exception shown when i open the Toplink Map: Local Exception Stack: Exception [TOPLINK-6044] (Oracle TopLink - 11g Release 1 (11.1.1.5.0) (Build 110305)): oracle.toplink.exceptions.QueryException Exception Description: The primary key read from the row [DatabaseRecord()] during the execution of the query was detected to be null.

I am currently using activemq failover uir for client reconnecting to the broker, and I also don't want "send" operation to be blocked when it disconnect, so I am using URI likefailover:(tcp://192.168.193.177:61616)?timeout=1, while the problem is if I can't get connection for the first time, the connecting will time out and the reconnecting doesn't work, the exception I got: Dec 7, 2011 3:39:28 PM org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport oneway INFO: Failover timed out after 2ms Dec 7, 2011 3:39:28 PM org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport doReconnect INFO: Successfully connected to tcp://127.0.0.1:61616 Exception in thread "pool-1-thread-2" java.lang.NullPointerException at com.cicc.mdf.dataserver.messaging.JMSMessagePublisher.publish(JMSMessagePublisher.java:197) at com.cicc.mdf.dataserver.messaging.JMSMessagePublisher.publishRealTimeData(JMSMessagePublisher.java:270) at com.cicc.mdf.dataserver.service.MarketDataService.process(MarketDataService.java:984) at com.cicc.mdf.message.parser.BroadcastMessageParser.parseElement(BroadcastMessageParser.java:219) at com.cicc.mdf.connectivity.RawDataParser.slice(RawDataParser.java:433) at com.cicc.mdf.connectivity.RawDataParser.run(RawDataParser.java:110) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.runTask(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:886) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:908) I thought the timeout parameter only works on send operation without interfere with reconnecting, but the first connecting? EDIT: if the java client connected to the broker successfully for the first time, then if connection got disconnected, send operation will time out when connection don't established, and java client will reconnect to the broker, that what i am expected. while if java client can't connect to the broker successfully for the first time, the connecting will time out, not trying to reconnect till successfully that what i am unexpected, am I some place wrong? EDIT: Activemq version: 5.3.0 EDIT: Sorry, the URI is valid, it's my mistake, I was confused by another exception any idea? Thanks ps: this is my first time on Stackoverflow, any unconventional behalve, pls correct it
I am running rsync through my java application.(Solaris Evn) The Java application will sync the files with remote machine. During our connection failure testing we noticed an issue running rsync through java program. The java application which is running at source side is not receiving any error message if there are any connection issues during the sync process. Brief details about the test scenario: We run the Java Program The java program starts the rsync command and sync the large number of files from source to remote destination During the sync process we run the ps -ef | grep rsync to check whether the processes are running or not at both(source and dest) side. Both side rsync processes are running. We identify the rsync process id at target machine and kill the process with kill -9 <pid> The java code didn't receive any error message and didn't exit. It just hung. And also noticed that the rsync process is still running at source side and rsync process is also not printing any log message in the log file. Note : If we run the rsync command directly (not through java program) , then everything is working fine. When we stop the rsync process at target the source process will be stopped. When RSYNC terminated at target, the Java program and RSYNC is not detecting that the target has issues. No log files written , Java program will hang and becomes unresponsive. Through perl its working fine. Not sure what the problem with java...!!! I don’t have any clues to debug this issue. Please share your thoughts and pointer to debug.

There a quite a few questions in SO related to the "OutOfMemoryError: Java Heap" error, but reading over them, most seem to discuss how to increase the heap size or profiling the app and detecting memory leaks. I'm working on a project, that invovles analyzing the cost of a branch and bound algorithm. For input small input sizes, the potential number of solutions to search grows at O(n!). At a certain input size, n, I've encountered the "OutOfMemoryError" because the parial solutions are kept in a priority queue until ready to be treated, and the huge number of partial solutions in the queue fills up the memory. So, I know I don't have a memory leak, and I don't necessarily want to increase the heap size. What I'd like to do is simply detect when the memory is nearly full, then give the user a message that tells them what's going on and why the program is exiting (it's not necessary the program keep functioning at this point). Is there a way to do this? I have looked at the java.lang.management package, but it doesn't make much sense to me, and I've had difficulty finding decent example code. Any explanation or example code is appreciated.
This is basically the picture: I have a server and a client (operating through localhost). Server creates a clientthread for each connection. this new thread blocks on read waiting for messages from client. At will, i can deactivate the server through the GUI, which sends (from a main thread) "disconnect" to the client, and then closes the output stream, to wake up the blocked clientthread, which in turn finishes up by closing the socket (I believe this closing is unnecessary after closing outputstream but anyway). Client side: After connection request, it sleeps 10 seconds, writes a disconnect message and reads the answer char by char. The problem: After deactivating the server within that 10 second client sleep time, client reads the "disconnect" message correctly from the server. However, If I just add a dummy print for each char read (inside the while loop), the result of the final read is varying. Sometimes it will read the server's "disconnect" correctly, sometimes it will read "disco", or a similar variation, and throw this exception: "Java exception : "Software caused connection abort: recv failed" Any suggestions as to why adding a few prints creates this result? I would assume having a closed socket on the other end wouldn't have an effect on reading the message. The other threads I found about recv errors mentioned timeouts, which I'm guessing shouldn't really be happening when using localhost?
I use eclipse debugger to step through debug points. My problem is that when i update the java code for server, the eclipse doesnt take the updated code. Also the break points seem to appear from previous code. The break points do not work...Example, sometimes, the debugger steps through an empty white line, instead of going to next statement. Seems to me like an update issue for java cache. I am not sure as to how to avoid it. I usually go with clean and build. But, is there a easier way to just hot deploy the code and make all of it work properly without rebuilding the entire project? OR another quick question, can we atleast automate java cache clean mechanism to run everytime in windows? # My question was, even when I refresh the project/ when I clean & build, sometimes in Eclipse the old code is taken instead of a new code. I am not sure why this happens, only when I clear the java cache, this issue dissapers and I have to redeploy my jboss. My question to you guys was, is there a way to avoid this?? I am using Flex builder( built on eclipse) for development.
For a class project, I'm working with the Sphinx open source speech recognition framework produced by Carnegie Mellon University. This is my first exposure to using ant to build applications, and its been an interesting time. I've written an application whose goal is to take in audio input from either microphone input or a WAV file, transcribe it using one of two available configurations, and output the words as well as the confidence scoring. The code I wrote works, except for the confidence scoring of words. That code was adapted from a demonstration utility included with the svn checkout and that utility works as advertised. However, in my project, it throws a NullPointerException, and I can't figure out why from the code alone. Since this application is built using ant, I know I need to insert some code in the buildscript to allow debugging. This question was helpful in understanding what to do, but I have no idea where to insert that code. I'm assuming its in the header, but the source really shows no place to include JVM arguments. How do I accomplish debugging in this situation?
I am using JCS for caching in my application.Recently some errors are occuring where concurrent access to data in the cache results in null value i.e one thread writes to the cache and one thread reads to the cache.I want to know whether JCS inherently supports thread safe implementations when writing and reading from the cache. I also want to know how to make my implementation thread safe.Because I have multiple classes writing to the cache,say PutData which implements Runnable is used for writing to the cache and GetData which also implements Runnable for reading from the cache,so making the method synchronized has no meaning and also making them atomic also is not meaningful since the data is not shared among the classes and I pass around the data object to the individual classes.BTW I am using a POJO serialiazed class. Is there anyway to overcome this,or do I have to change my implementation in such a way that it forcefully completes writing and then reading,which is foolish I think. This is more of like a producer-consumer problem except in the fact that my consumer thread here is not consuming data,but just reading data. So synchronizing does guarantee that only one thread writes to the cache,but that does not solve my problem because the other thread accesses objects of different key. Expecting your answers, Thanks, Madhu.
I'm importing a class which has been deprecated, which I'm forced to use. I want to suppress the deprecated error using the @SuppressWarnings("deprecation") annotation. As per the comment on that annotation: As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation on the most deeply nested element where it is effective. If you want to suppress a warning in a particular method, you should annotate that method rather than its class. So I clearly don't want to annotate the class and thus suppress deprecation warnings on any type my class uses, but I also would like to use the import statement to avoid typing out the fully qualified type name, which spans my entire monitor, on each use of the deprecated class. I think I want to do something like annotating the import statement with @SuppressWarnings (NOT POSSIBLE) or specifying in the @SuppressWarnings annotation which type to ignore warnings for (e.g. @SuppressWarnings("deprecation", "fully.qualified.type.name"). I want to indicate to the compiler "it's okay if I use this one, and only this one, deprecated class, referenced by its Simple Name, anywhere within this other class, and any other deprecated classes I reference you should let me know about". Is there anything like this available?
Eclipse bug 286808 adds warning messages for including certain files (like .classpath, .project, plugin.xml) in the src.includes for a plugin. Those files seem pretty important for a source release, assuming that you want someone who receives the release to be able to not only code against your plugin but potentially change it. (I guess you could do a source release purely so people can debug against it, but then why would you discourage modification of the plugin by removing these files that are important for development?) I'm struggling to understand why this change was made. Can anyone provide a reasonable explanation for it? Edit: Example of the warning message: "'plugin.xml' should not be added to src.includes list as it is not required in source build" Edit 2: As can be seen from the answers, I think I asked the wrong question. Should have been: what is the intended purpose of an RCP plugin "Source Build"...
This is a question about garbage collection in java: if one allocates a large block of memory (using new int[BIG_NUMBER] or however), is there any guarantee that a garbage collector will collect the garbage before an OutOfMemoryError is thrown? Is this behaviour of garbage collector a part of the Java spec by now? I have learnt that a garbage collector itself might throw such exception in case it takes too long to collect the garbage, at least in the case of Sun Hotspot Java Virtual Machine «The parallel / concurrent collector will throw an OutOfMemoryError if too much time is being spent in garbage collection: if more than 98% of the total time is spent in garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered, an OutOfMemoryError will be thrown. This feature is designed to prevent applications from running for an extended period of time while making little or no progress because the heap is too small. If necessary, this feature can be disabled by adding the option -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit to the command line. » but this may be disabled, according to the citation, by adding an option to the command line.
I am using jconn2.jar(5.5) jdbc driver for Sybase to connect to a sybase database from a standalone java application. My java application will read thousands of records from a text file and insert in to the table in the sybase database. I have a select query with IN clause.This IN clause will have more than 10,000 values. while executing this query, the application is returning the below error: Caused by: com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybSQLException: Too many parameters -- symbol table overflow. at com.sybase.jdbc2.tds.Tds.processEed(Tds.java:3281) at com.sybase.jdbc2.tds.Tds.nextResult(Tds.java:2548) at com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.ResultGetter.nextResult(ResultGetter.java:69) at com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybStatement.nextResult(SybStatement.java:220) at com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybStatement.nextResult(SybStatement.java:203) at com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybStatement.queryLoop(SybStatement.java:1614) at com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybStatement.executeQuery(SybStatement.java:1599) at com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybPreparedStatement.executeQuery(SybPreparedStatement.java:96) at org.apache.commons.dbcp.DelegatingPreparedStatement.executeQuery(DelegatingPreparedStatement.java:93) at org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate$1.doInPreparedStatement(JdbcTemplate.java:648) at org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate.execute(JdbcTemplate.java:591) ... 10 more The same query is working well for values in IN clause with up to 10,000 values.

I was wondering if there was a way to use Windows Error Reporting from "inside" a Java program? In other words, use the mechanism to report exceptions back to a central location without having the actual JVM crash (which to my understanding is what triggers this in the first place). The idea here is to make it easier to collect bug reports from Windows users. I'd like to hear too if it can be part of a controlled shutdown. I.e. not a JVM crash but a normal, controlled exit from a Java program. After thinking it over, I think that it would be sufficient for our purposes to create a set of text files (or perhaps just pipe in a single text stream) to a tiny Windows application located inside our part of the file system. Said Windows application then crashes prominently and cause a report to be sent including the text provided by us. Would that work?
It seems like whenever I try to use XML-related classes in my Dynamic Web Projects in Eclipse and I try to run a class with a main method just for testing, I'm getting errors like AbstractMethodError and NoSuchMethodError. It seems like some kind of classpath issue since I had identical versions of these projects running fine on my machine before it was formatted. An example that tries to use XMLBeans: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.ecw.adapterservice.schema.p2p.impl.ReferralRequestTypeImpl.generatedSetterHelperImpl(Lorg/apache/xmlbeans/XmlObject;Ljavax/xml/namespace/QName;IS)Lorg/apache/xmlbeans/XmlObject; An example that tries to use a simple DOM parser: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AbstractMethodError: org.apache.xerces.dom.ElementImpl.setTextContent(Ljava/lang/String;)V One interesting thing I noticed is that when I try to launch my executable class from within my project, Eclipse pops up a window that searches my entire project for 'main types'. I don't think I've ever seen it do this before and I suspect it may be related to the problems I'm having. Again, please note that identical copies of the source/libs for these projects used to be able to run the same individual classes without issue. Does anyone have any insight into this issue? This is driving me nuts.

I project to build my own bytecodes debugger to view: the currents "objects" in the operands stack; to have a visual representation of frames; to have a list of declared objects in the Java heap (of the running program); to have a list of constant pools, etc The problem is I want to set up in place a breakpoint options to my program and to see the application in real. I looked on the internet the way to do a debugger, and I found JDPA wich could probably help me doing my project. But, I am not sure its the good thing, cause I don't want a Java debugger, I really need a Bytecode debugger. How can I insert bytecodes break points in a project ? I see on the internet that "0xca is reserved as a breakpoint instruction for debuggers and is not used by the language". Is it the good way ?
I am developing a web service client using Apache CXF 2.5.0 , JDK 7 and Eclipse Helios EE. I am getting the folllowing error when I execute the web service client in eclipse. Exception in thread "main" javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException: Reference to policy #AddressingPolicy could not be resolved.. I have followed the below steps so far to deploy the client. Created a java project in eclipse helios EE and added CXF runtime to the project. Using Apache CXF 2.5.0 WSDL2Java generated the java classes for the client ( included -exsh true option to process the headers). The classes were generated in the eclipse src dir. Implemented the main method in the client class to invoke the web service. When I execute the client I get the above exception. I have checked the WSDL and it has one Policy Reference element with xml id = #AddressingPolicy and another Policy Reference element with xml id = #TlsPolicy within the binding element. The respective policies are given in the WSDL at the end of the WSDl using wsp:Policy elements. I cannot modify the WSDL as it has been already deployed as a external service and provided to me to develop the client. Has anyone faced similar issue with Apache CXF 2.5.0 before. Also I feel it could be an issue with the version of CXF I am using. Does Apache CXF 2.5.0 support local policy references within the WSDL. Appreciate your responses.
I searched for similar questions on this issue but found none related to Mac OSX. Situation: Trying to test android apps on a Galaxy S (Details below) but Mac is not detecting the device. Tried all the things below and have wondered whether this might be a driver issue (which I've heard things about for Samsung USB debugging). Questions: 1) Are samsung drivers required for android USB debugging? 2) And are they available for Mac OSX? 3) Any other reasons OSX might not detect device for usb debugging? Things I tried: Enabled USB Debugging @ Settings >> Applications >> Development >> USB Debugging Enabled Tethering @ Settings >> Wireless and network >> Tethering >> USB Tethering Set Tethered mode @ Settings >> USB connection >> Tethered mode Attempt to detect devices via ./adb devices (from platform tools dir) Verified that "Unknown Sources" is checked @ Settings >> Applications >> Unknown Sources Verified that device is connected to Mac Restarted phone Restarted mac Added various device / product ids to adb_usb.ini Did ./android update adb (which does adb kill-server / start-server) Using: Samsung Galaxy S (4G) with Sprint Mac OSX 10.6.8 Eclipse Classic 3.7.1
I have a Java program that is communicating with other programs on a network using UDP packets. I noticed that on my Windows XP machine, I could not receive in-bound packets, and after some research, I figured out that it was the firewall causing the trouble. Is there a way to add a firewall exception for a Java program? Googling doesn't reveal anything for this. Is there a DOS shell command I can run at install time that will add the exception? (Also can't find anything on Google for that.) Is there a way to work around it in a way that lets Windows know the in-bound packets are solicited? For instance, I'm sending out a broadcast packet, and then other systems respond. Anything I can do with regard to which ports I use for the broadcast that will allow the response packet? Is there an entirely different way I could go about receiving the response? I still need to broadcast, because this will be run on networks that don't necessarily even have DNS, so I can't rely on things like Zeroconf (not to mention the fact that there's no good Zeroconf support available for Java) to discover the other machines on the network. Thanks.
I've just tried to deploy my test app to GAE but the error dialog opens as " An error occurred while trying to sign in 400.

I am developing an Android Application for a client and have run into a problem with the tablet that he wants it to run on. Long story short, I don't think I have the right USB drivers and can't find any applicable ones. I have tried to contact the manufacturer but no luck. The tablet is a WM6850 tablet running Android 2.2, I believe. I have switched it to debugging mode and hit the switches that I needed to hit to allow foreign applications but I still can't see it under adb devices. If I switch it to use as a mass storage device, I can see it from Windows Explorer. Does anyone know where I could find USB drivers for this device OR if there is something I have missed to get this device recognized? Thanks for your help, if there is any more clarification needed I would be happy to provide. -Iain
I've come to Java from C++. In the C++ world we pay attention to exception safety, and note that mutators can provide different guarantees in the face of exceptions thrown by the mutator itself or a method it delegates to (minimum, strong, no-throw). Implementing a method that has a strong exception guarantee requires that some basic operations are guaranteed never to throw an exception. The JLS makes statements about which operations can throw which kinds of exceptions, but the VirtualMachineError error presents a problem. Quoth the JLS: an internal error or resource limitation prevents the Java virtual machine from implementing the semantics of the Java programming language; in this case, an instance of a subclass of VirtualMachineError is thrown. The JLS says no more about VirtualMachineError. An "internal error" means a bug in the JVM, so I'm not interested in that case: in the face of bugs in the JVM, all bets are off. But what about the "resource limitation" case? Are there any operations that are guaranteed never to fail because of a resource limitation?
I have an apache proxy between browser and my custom web server. So after starting the webserver, I can access my web application for like 4-5 hours. After that I get this error Proxy Error The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server. The proxy server could not handle the request GET /. Reason: Error reading from remote server To access the web application again, I have to restart the web server. I tried to check the log I got from my web server and only error in that log , I am finding is this com.mysql.jdbc.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure due to underlying exception: ** BEGIN NESTED EXCEPTION ** java.net.SocketException MESSAGE: Connection timed out STACKTRACE: java.net.SocketException: Connection timed out at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method) at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:146) at com.mysql.jdbc.util.ReadAheadInputStream.fill(ReadAheadInputStream.java:113) at com.mysql.jdbc.util.ReadAheadInputStream.readFromUnderlyingStreamIfNecessary(ReadAheadInputStream.java:160) at com.mysql.jdbc.util.ReadAheadInputStream.read(ReadAheadInputStream.java:188) at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.readFully(MysqlIO.java:1910) at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.reuseAndReadPacket(MysqlIO.java:2304) at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.checkErrorPacket(MysqlIO.java:2803) at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sendCommand(MysqlIO.java:1573) at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sqlQueryDirect(MysqlIO.java:1665) at com.mysql.jdbc.Connection.execSQL(Connection.java:3170) at com.mysql.jdbc.Connection.execSQL(Connection.java:3099) at com.mysql.jdbc.Statement.execute(Statement.java:695) at hra.database.Pool.getConnection(Pool.java:62) ** END NESTED EXCEPTION ** Last packet sent to the server was 925624 ms ago. And I tried to fix this database error, but I still get the above mentioned proxy error, so definitely the log information is not useful. This is what I am getting from Apache Proxy log (70007)The timeout specified has expired: proxy: error reading status line from remote server Does anyone know what can be the issue or any helpful pointers to fix this issue?
I know, this sounds like an old question, which has been asked before(*). But it is a little bit different. I installed a clean system with the newest versions of JDK (7u2) and eclipse (and also AndroidSDK). When I import old projects, I get an error "The method methodName(Parameter) of type Class must override a superclass method". The @override-tag was there (correctly), because the method overrides a method of an INTERFACE of the superclass. somehow compiler thinks that this tag is just for superclass directly. As far as i know @override is not changed in Java 7 and my project was working properly on 6. Is it a possible bug or compability problem or I am missing something? (*)Similar problem used to happen, when compiling on JDK5, simply because @override was yet implemented in Java 5. Solution was, of course changing compiler compliance level to 6. But what is it with JDK 7 now?
I'm using Eclipse Helios Service Release 2, Java 6 and JUnit 4. I've got a test case that passes when I debug it by itself and fails when I run it by itself. The failure is coming from the line FileUtils.deleteDirectory(target); with the error ERROR [main] (MyRequestHandler.java:56) - An unexpected error occurred when processing MyRequestHandler java.io.IOException: Unable to delete file: \apps\Codes\MP2\LandingStrips\inprocess\12345\testTarDir\myfile.txt In both cases the call File.canWrite(); is coming back true before the proram attempts to delete it. The only other things I know is that the runtime arguments during debug are [-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,address=localhost:2914, -Dfile.encoding=Cp1252] and during run are [-Dfile.encoding=Cp1252] I'm not sure what that means or if it matters, but for the sake of providing as much background as possible there it is.

I have a crawler Java application which is supposed to connect to some HTTP servers, download the HTML content of their pages, then move on to other HTTP servers. For this task, I've used the Apache HTTP library. At the first few hours of the run, things seem to work rather smoothly (there are some connection-related exceptions thrown around from time to time, but that's to be expected). Yet after a while, it seems like I keep getting SocketTimeoutException on every request I send out. The exception does not occur on the HttpClient class's "execute" method, but rather when I try to get the content of the Entity (which I retrieve from the HttpResponse object), or when I try to write that content to a file. Then, if I stop the application, and start it over again, things seem to go back to working fine - even though it picks up from where it stopped at, meaning it's interacting with the same servers which I received the SocketTimeoutException when trying to interact with before. I tried looking for all kinds of possible clean-ups that I might be missing and might be essential when using this library, but couldn't find anything. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
I have written two little hello world applications using Grails (V2.0.0.RC1), and I want to deploy them using Glassfish (v3.1). If I deploy it either one of the applications all by itself on Glassfish the application works just fine, and I can access it either at http://t1-0.1 or at http://t2-0.1. If instead, however, I deploy one of the applications, and then deploy the other (so that both are available to people visiting my web site), then the second deployment command gives me the following error message: c:>asadmin deploy t2-0.1.war remote failure: Error occurred during deployment: Exception while loading the app : java.lang.IllegalStateException: ContainerBase.addChild: start: org.apache.catalina.LifecycleException: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'transactionManagerPostProcessor': Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'transactionManager': Cannot resolve reference to bean 'sessionFactory' while setting bean property 'sessionFactory'; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'sessionFactory': Cannot resolve reference to bean 'hibernateProperties' while setting bean property 'hibernateProperties'; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Errorcreating bean with name 'hibernateProperties': Cannot resolve reference to bean'dialectDetector' while setting bean property 'properties' with key [hibernate.dialect]; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'dialectDetector': Invocation of init methodfailed; nested exception is org.springframework.jdbc.support.MetaDataAccessException: Error while extracting DatabaseMetaData; nested exception is org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create PoolableConnectionFactory (Database may be already in use: "Locked by another process".

What's going on here? I presume that there is something peculiar about Grails and its use of Hibernate (since otherwise Glassfish wouldn't complain about allowing me to have two applications that work together). But maybe I'm misreading the error message? Does anybody have any recommendations?
Recently a new concept of Theories was added to JUnit (since v4.4). In a nutshell, you can mark your test method with @Theory annotation (instead of @Test), make your test method parametrized and declare an array of parameters, marked with @DataPoints annotation somewhere in the same class. JUnit will sequentially run your parametrized test method passing parameters retrieved from @DataPoints one after another. But only until the first such invocation fails (due to any reason). The concept seems to be very similar to @DataProviders from TestNG, but when we use data providers, all the scenarios are run inspite of their execution results. And it's useful because you can see how many scenarious work/don't work and you can fix your program more effectively. So, I wonder what's the reason not to execute @Theory-marked method for every @DataPoint? (It appears not so difficult to inherit from Theories runner and make a custom runner which will ignore failures but why don't we have such behaviour out of the box?) UPD: I have created a fault-tolerant version of Theories runner and made it available for a public access: https://github.com/rgorodischer/fault-tolerant-theories In order to compare it with the standard Theories runner run StandardTheoriesBehaviorDemo then FaultTolerantTheoriesBehaviorDemo which are placed under src/test/... folder.
I have a Java applet that runs on visiting a site, whereupon it receives, parses and displays streamed data. Unfortunately said applet isn't particularly well designed and I would like to extract the streamed data to make it more useful for myself. In order to do this, I need to get insight into the connections made, data being exchanged, the state of variables in use and so on, so that I can replicate the log in and streaming. So far I've been using Wireshark for network traffic, Java Debug Console and eyeballing the applet source installed on my system but still without success- primarily because there is a series of connections being made to the remote server and I am unsure the exact nature of the requests (and responses) and the variables contained. Does a suitable app exist that can provide such insight? I should add that I have no experience developing with Java, my knowledge is in Python, mainly.

I'm making a Java program based on an Access 2003 database to keep all the data of clients, contacts, artists, works, exhibitions, etc for an art gallery. I have several fields in the DB where I need to store dates, so I've set the format (in the DB fields) as "date/time". The fields are "not required", and they are not the primary (or secondary, or foreign) key in the table. When I run the program everything else works fine, but for same reason if I leave the "date" field in the form blank it doesn't save anything in the whole form and throws an error (it jumps to the "catch exception" line without saving anything). If I write a valid date, it works fine, it doesn't matter the format I use (i.e. it accepts 2/5/2010, 02/05/2010, 2/5/10, 2-5-2010). Also, If I change the format in the DB to "text" the problem disappears, and I can leave the field blank if I want to. The thing is I need to be able to do searches by date, so the format is important. Any suggestions? I'm a beginner in both Java and Access, so it's probably something stupid I'm doing wrong, but it's really annoying, because it doesn't seem to have any logic.
I have a Java Web Application where my clients connect to the Web Service to update a MySQL database (using JDBC) with their data. What i want to do is to check wether the requested table exists without using MetaData every time a client connects and uses an operation of the Web Service. I thought of just executing INSERT every time and the first client that connects to the web service will cause an SQLException that i will catch, look at its ErrorCode to decide wether it is caused by nonexistant table and if that's the case it will (inside the catch clause) create the table, insert the data that couldn't be inserted earlier because of the Exception and then create a thread to handle that particular client (e.g. check that it will refresh its entry in the database every x seconds). Will this implementation do the job? Is the thread going to run properly and everything, even though it will be started inside the catch clause of an Exception?
In a program I am using two external jar libraries. There is a class in the external library X invoking a method m of a class in the library Y. The library X was compiled with version 1.0 of library Y. However, since I am using library Y for other purposes in my code, I preferred to use its last version (let's say 5.0). My problem is that when I execute the code, library X complains that the method m is not there anymore (throwing a NoSuchMethod error). However, the method is there. The problem could be related to the fact that I am using a newer version of the library Y than the one that was present at compilation time ? (although backward compatible, with different bytecode?). If that is the case then I will be a bit puzzled since I thought that java method calls were expressed in byte code as symbolic references (e.g., method signatures), and not as direct references (e.g., offsets), but I could have misunderstood something. Thanks for any clarification !
I encounter a problem " 'publishing to tomcat v7.0 server at localhost' has encountered a problem" while starting my tomcat server from eclipse. This problem arised after i tried to solve the 404 error by selecting the 'use tomcat installation' option in the setting of the server. The server seems to be running but it actually isn't. Publishing the configuration...

I know the question is a bit simplistic, but I feel like I'm missing something big and obvious. I am following the tutorial for graphics handling in android from ( http://www.droidnova.com/playing-with-graphics-in-android-part-vi,209.html ). When I look at logcat, it tells me a line number where it thinks the null pointer exception came from) When I replace the numbers that are pulled from classes there with constants, the null pointer exception just moves somewhere else in the program. Is there some way in the eclipse debugger to identify what specific pointer it views as the one that is null when it shouldn't be? I get the null pointer exception, and that's all it will say, that there's an exception, but no information on what pointer is supposedly null. Also, when I try to put in breakpoints for testing, while I can get the debugger to come up and stop at the breakpoint, logcat shows that a null pointer exception has still been thrown, even though the breakpoint should be hit before the part causing the exception comes up. Why are breakpoints being ignored?
I am going through a Spring book to learn Spring. Having gone through sections about the JDBCTemplate i was surprised to find that Spring handles most of the SQLException exceptions differently. For example, all checked exceptions are converted to unchecked exceptions. What exactly is the benefit of this? In my experience, the majority of SQL exceptions should be handled. For example, we have an application that talks to an Oracle PL/SQL procedure. The call to the PL/SQL procedure can return an ORA-01403: no data found exception. This kind of exception is one that you usually recover from by displaying an error message to the user. e.g. A search result did not return anything. How would this kind of a checked exception be handled in Spring if all exceptions are unchecked i.e. Spring wont force you to handle them? I know that you can catch RuntimeExceptions but i quite liked the idea that you are forced to handle checked exceptions. What benefit does converting some of the checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions provide?
I have a project A that depends on project B that depends on project C. Project C depends on Hibernate (more precisely org.hibernate:hibernate-core:3.6.8.Final). Project B doesn't depend on the hibernate artifact. But, project A depends on this artifact but only for unit tests, so I use test scope. When I try to build A, projects C and B are correctly built and installed but I get the following error during A compilation: Failure executing javac, but could not parse the error: myPackage\MyClass.class(myPackage:MyClass.class): warning: Cannot find annotation method 'value()' in type 'org.hibernate.annotations.Cascade': class file for org.hibernate.annotations.Cascade not found An exception has occurred in the compiler (1.6.0_27). Please file a bug at the Java Developer Connection (http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport) after checking the Bug Parade for duplicates. Include your program and the following diagnostic in your report. Thank you. com.sun.tools.javac.code.Symbol$CompletionFailure: class file for org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType not found I precise that MyClass belongs to project C and imports org.hibernate.annotations.Cascade. And C compiles successfully so it can find the said class. But here, it seems that the class file cannot be found during A compilation. I thought that maybe the test-scoped dependency on Hibernate may cancel the Hibernate dependency of C? But, I have no idea. Also, if I change the scope of the dependency in project A from test to compile, the problem disappears. Thanks for your help
I have a Java client that consumes SharePoint 2010 standard web services (sitedata.asmx, permissions.asmx, etc) written with JAX-WS implementation from the JDK 6. So far, authentication is done with NTLM using a custom Authenticator implementation and Authenticator.setDefault(...) approach. When running on my test environment which has only one SharePoint server, it works fine. I can see all the NTLM negotiation using WireShark. But, if running on a costumer which has multiple servers, hardware load balancing and multiple SharePoint alternate access mappings I get Error 401 Unauthorized from the web service calls. I haven't had a chance to use WireShark to debug on that environment. I run my client from a Windows machine (on the costumer setup), so according to Java documentation it should be fine for NTLM. Also, I used the default URL from SharePoint to access the web services (not the load balanced URLs). The machine running the client application, is not a SharePoint server. It has Windows Integrated Authentication with NTLM configured. Also, due SharePoint administration policies, I´m unable to access SharePoint Central Administration or do any change to the configuration (nor IIS). I want to ask if anyone knows what the issue may be? And hopefully if anyone knows how to fix it? Thanks in advance. EDIT: It´s important to mention, that the same permission levels were granted on both environments.
You see, I have an applet that decrypts some info based on the RSA private key that is found in a pkcs11 token. In Brazil, there are now, some new certificates that contains a 2048 bit privatekey. There are old models with regular 1024 bit, as well. Until now, my app was working fine. I was using 1024bit certificates, so no bother. But now that I have some new certificates to test, it crashes with the title error: PKCS11Exception: CKR_KEY_FUNCTION_NOT_PERMITTED btw: it is still working for the 1024 bits. at sun.applet.AppletPanel.run(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) Caused by: sun.security.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11Exception: CKR_KEY_FUNCTION_NOT_PERMITTED at sun.security.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11.C_DecryptInit(Native Method) at sun.security.pkcs11.P11RSACipher.initialize(P11RSACipher.java:260) at sun.security.pkcs11.P11RSACipher.implInit(P11RSACipher.java:193) I use the standart java security namespace. I've read somewhere that Java comes with a limitation, on the policies, something related to how US treat security, I don't know... Is there any relation? I am aware that I must use the bouncyCastle provider, but I am just wondering... For all that matters, BC cannot use a P11PrivateKey, as it uses the hardware to sign or encrypt. Conclusion: As I`ve found out, thanks to owlstead, in the etoken properties, the key was not made for that porpouse... god... The one that does not work: Serial number: (...) Issued to: (...)

Key specification: AT_KEYEXCHANGE Default Key Container: Yes Auxiliary Key Container: Yes I know that AT_KEYEXCHANGE by itself does not mean that can decrypt, but having AT_KEYSIGNATURE means that can only be used for that porpouse. And as i've tested that one works for signatures...
I got could not initialize proxy no Session exception on my JSP pages. Here is what I do; There are DAOs for Hibernate. These are not special classes. They just have autowired instances of Hibernate SessionFactory. Yes I use pure Hibernate to do my DB access. The functions on DAO classes are annotated with @Transactional(rollBackFor=Exception.class) and My spring configurations prepared accordingly. Also my entities/controllers are also configured with Annotations etc. I dont have a seperate Service classes layer. My Services and DAOs are overlapped. they are same. If a Service class need to access DB they are just annotated with @Repository rather than @Service Until this error, everything was working perfectly. (I have hundreds of classes/DAOs/entities etc) Now, I need to call two DAO/Service functions at one of my controllers. I only call second DAO function when the first one throws an exception. I need to throw exceptions based on some conditions to rollback the changes made with first DAO call. The second call just to show some information from DB to the user who entered wrong input. I dont know why but the second DAO call is working, its gets classes from DB. then I forward this classes on to my Model attribute on my controllers so my JSPs can displays them. But when my JSP pages tries to access attributes of these classes I got the could not initialize proxy no Session exception. So here is my question, what should I do to avoid this errors. Should I do something with hibernate transaction/session on the first DAO call? Because I do nothing. I just get a session and do get/save/update etc on it. I think @Transactional attribute will handle the transaction issues and @Repository attribute handles the session issues. I have already tried lazy/eager loading issue. I have already put OpenSessionInViewFilter filter on my configurations. But none of them solved my problem. Any advises/thoughts?
I'm working on an enormous applet, loads over 100 jars, 50 of which are third-party. All of them are signed and trusted. Unfortunately, one, openmap, loads binary files (shape and layer files). I cannot sign these files (AFAIK), because they aren't jars, don't have manifests, etc. Since the jar loads binary files, I get the mixed code warning when running. The only thing I've figured out to avoid this is to mark EVERY .jar as "Trusted-Library: true". Changing the manifest on all the .jars means that all the .jars have to be re-signed, which is a political problem. I know the dialog can be disabled in the java control panel. I'm looking for another workaround. Naively, I would like to be able to somehow mark openmap or my jar that uses it to be trusted (or whatever it takes) to load those files without the warning. I tried making openmap a trusted-library, that doesn't eliminate the error. If I try making my jar that uses openmap a trusted library, then I run into issues because my jar depends on yet other jars and the class definitions in my jar can't be loaded because those dependent classes are in another classloader. Edit: This appears to trigger the dialog (Clicked "Yes, block potentially unsafe" to get this logging statement) security: resource name "http://localhost:8080/maps/politicalWorld/vmap_political_world/vmap_area_thin.shp" in http://localhost:8080/app/client-lib/ : java.lang.SecurityException: trusted loader attempted to load sandboxed resource from http://localhost:8080/app/client-lib/
We have a situation where our Spring wires up some beans that include ActiveMQ classes built with Java 6. Our application runs on customer's servers, so we can't guarantee that they have Java 6 or later installed. If they happen to have Java 5, the application can't start because of BeanCreationExceptions with the classes that depend on ActiveMQ (root cause being a UnsupportedClassVersionError). So my question is, is there any way to ignore a BeanCreationException and still start the application? I want to be able to display an error message saying that they need to install Java 6 or later, but since the application can't even start, I never have a chance to do this. My hunch is that there is no way to do this, because Spring needs to be able to guarantee that my application is built properly after initialization, but I thought I would ask anyway. Any other suggestions for how to accomplish my end goal would also be helpful and appreciated. We are using Spring 3.0.6 Thanks!
For a project for school I have to program different kind of algorithms. The problem is, I got a working algorithm. But I have to run it several times and after some time it gives me the following errors: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space I know what the error means, but is it possible to let Java search for empty space during the run? I know it uses a lot of space which isn't used at some point. It sets a lot of object to null during the application run and create a lot of new ones, because of this it runs out of memory. So concrete: is it possible to let the JVM free some space that is set to null? Or free some space in the time the program is running? I know I can set the JVM to more space, but sooner or later I will run to the same problem. If you need my IDE (in case it is IDE specific) it is Eclipse.
We have a web application which sometimes (quite rarely, several times a day) gives an error in production. It is deployed on Tomcat, uses Spring+Hibernate, the error is caused by a Hibernate exception which is hard to understand without actually logging the parameters passed to the method of the Hibernate class. It is not possible to replace the Hibernate library with a modified version which logs the parameters, and spring-aop cannot be used since the "beans" are not managed. I have seen an example of byte code instrumentation using javassist, on http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2008/04/24/add-logging-at-class-load-time-with-instrumentation.html, however trying to run it under tomcat, the instrumented code does not seem to run, probably due to classloader problems which I currently don't understand. What I am asking then, is this: does anyone know of a more or less simple way to instrument the byte code under tomcat for such a task as logging the parameters of methods in external libraries? is there some further insight you may give on this problem?
On AIX 6.1 ppc64, in order to load libm.a, our application uses the System.loadLibrary("m"). Or it fails with an error message the module has invalid magic number According to IBM documentation, this can happen when there is a mismatch between 32 bits and 64 bits binaries. Or this happens whether we use Java6 (32 bits) or Java6_64 (64 bits) JVM. So it is NOT the case. Another possible causes is /usr/lib/libm.a is NOT a shared library. But we just can't find a shared mode libm.a on the platform to use! Acccdoring to Javadoc, in System.loadLibrary("name") , the mapping of "name" on to a real library is system dependent. On most Unix system, it is mapped to lib.so, while on AIX, it is mapped on to lib.a ; Note that on AIX, .a can be hybrid, ie. it can contain both static and shared object, 32 bits as well as 64 bits object. My problem is find a shared mode libm.a on AIX. Does anybody know how to use System.loadLibrary("m") to load a libm.a? P.S System.loadLibrary("m") works fine on most UNIX platforms we have tested.
Good afternoon all. I am aware that if we close() an java.io.OutputStream, it may throw an IOException when there are hard disk errors. As for java.io.InputStream, Javamex states that: A normal closure of a network socket actually involves a closure request (TCP/IP FIN packet) being sent over the connection and waiting for the other end to acknowledge this closure request. (In fact, the other end of the connection then in turn sends a closure request, which the closing end acknowledges.) So in the case of a socket input stream, a closure operation actually involves sending traffic over the connection and the closure can thus fail with an error. Now I was wondering exactly under what circumstances will a java.io.InputStream (or sub class) for a local file (network access not needed) ever throw an exception when we call close() ?
I have an app, built on GWT (google web toolkit) and JPA (eclipselink 2.3). it's not using GAE (app engine). when I finished application, I ran 'google->gwt compile' menu in eclipse and then uploaded /war content to the tomcat directory... application is running, but when I try to do one specific action in gui, I get an error message and Tomcat log contains this exception: http://paste2.org/p/1879857 (java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError) during development of the application, I encountered this kind of exception several times, it was always caused by absence of library .jar file in the war/WEB-INF/lib/... anytime it has occurred, I stored .jar to the folder and it worked... but not this time... this class is located in gwt-dev.jar (yes, it is there - have searched the archive) and it didn't help me to store archive to the lib/ folder... it is also included in classpath, and compiler had no problem... compilation finished without errors (so compiler can see the class). do you have any idea, how to make tomcat to see the class? thanks
I'm using JNI to access a native C file through my java program. I've created an shared object which eclipse and the project can now see. The problem I'm getting now is Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /opt/sw/libs/xda_core/.1.24.1-1/lib/lib_xda_core_java.so: /opt/sw/libs/xda_core/.1.24.1-1/lib/libxda_core_java.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64 (Possible cause: architecture word width mismatch) The so is a binary which was made for 64bit architecture. It sounds like there is a mismatch in the JVM and the so. I checked my JVM and it is a 64 bit runtime. However when I used System.Property("sun.arch.data.model") it returned "32" I think eclipse is running in a 32 bit JVM and this is why my JNI Native library won't link correctly and I'm getting that error. Any suggestions? Is this because I have a 32 bit version of eclipse? or is there a way I can force eclipse to use the 64 bit JVM that is installed. Edit: I have tried everyone's suggestions and nothing is working. I've changed the execution, and enviroment variables to point to the newst JDK I have which is 1.6_30. when I run the program from a command line I get 64 and amd64 as the value when I run the same program in eclise I get 32 and i386. Something is wrong in eclipse that is causing it to try and run it on a 32 bit JVM. when I try java -d32 -version it says that a 32 bit enviroment isn't installed but Eclipse doesn't know that. I've modified the Eclipse.ini file and still nothing is working. I've restarted eclipse after these changes...nothing. Can some one who knows eclipse well people help me out here. thanks
I'm using bean validation and extval validation. I've created a properties file called ValidationMessages.properties inside my class path. inside this file i customized the defult messages , for example: javax.validation.constraints.Size.message=this is a test messgae when the fieild is being validated I can see the message I worte, but the problem is that I also see the field and form name before the message ' like this: formName:fieldName this is a test. I want to remove this prefix. when it's a jsf validation I know that i need to add javax.faces.validator.BeanValidator.MESSAGE property, but here it does not work. what do I need to do inorder to remove this prefix and to see only the message itself? UPDATE: How can I override both bean validation and jsf default error messages? (and also to delete the prefix of the form and filed name befor the message) I have ValidationMessages.properties for the bean messages and messages.properties for the jsf validation. what do I need to define inside the config-xml and the web.xml files? and where do I put the javax.faces.validator.BeanValidator.MESSAGE property? this is very very important to me, any help will be appriciated, Thank's In Advance.
I'm new here, so mind me if I become impolite. I'm having problem with my Java JDK installation. I have a Toshiba laptop with 32-bit Windows 7 installed. Recently, I format the C drive and re-installed Win 7. Then, when I install the JDK on my newly installed Win 7 computer, an error pop-up. This is the message: This installation package could not be opened. Verify that the package exists and that you can access it, or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package. Before I format my hard disk, I have JDK 1.4, JRE, NetBeans, Eclipse, Servoy, Visual Studio 2008, MySQL and MS SQL Server. Everything worked fine in Windows 7 back then. And also, I can easily install all of these software after I install Win 7. Only the installation of JDK shows an error. So, if I can't install JDK, I can't install NetBeans, Eclipse and Servoy also. I've tried most websites online and they didn't give me one precise solution. I've also tried Windows UAC settings and other administrative settings. I'm not exaggerating myself, but I have three years experience of working together with Java. I haven't seen error like this. P.S. I've downloaded latest JDK version from Sun website. My old and new JDK installer packages show the same error. Weird!
I have a project on one computer that I need to work on another computer. I followed the tutorial here: http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/SEMaterials/tutorials/import_export/ to import and export the project files and transfer them via USB drive. However when I import the project I get a red exclamation mark icon on the project and an error saying: "The project cannot be built until build path errors are resolved" and "unbound classpath container: 'JRE System Library [BlackBerry JRE 6.0.0] in project 'MyProject'" I am using the blackberry plugin for eclipse, installed altogether from the RIM website. For reference here: http://us.blackberry.com/developers/javaappdev/javaplugin.jsp with version 1.5. I am very new to Java and this is my first time with eclipse so I really don't know what these errors mean even after googling for a while. I have attached a screenshot of the view from the new computer which I need to work on. Any help is appreciated!
I have jersey REST channel deployed on weblogic. All methods are configured to return JSON data. Jersey is using jackson inside. One of this method is working all the time and is returning the correct data, but the other returns 'null'. Literally, this means, 'null' is written on the screen. But the method definitely does not returns null, because I log everything. There seems to be no error, since no error is printed in logs, and I set 'INFO' level for root logger in log4j configuration. So I'm a bit lost - no idea what can be wrong when no error is reported and simply null is returned. Anyone can help? How to at least find out what is wrong? --edit-- In my case it was caused by missing getters/setters on fields of response class. There is a constructor, which was used by GSON, but not jersey/jackson. But the annoying thing is, this tools just returned null and not thrown any exception. So still, the question is, how to debug such errors, is it possible to force jersey/jackson to print the problems they find, and not such childisch behaviour ;)
I have made a library and exported it to a jar file that I am trying to import into my eclipse project and use. Eclipse says there's no problems but when I debug the application, it enters the new thread and goes to instantiate the object but then throws a ClassNotFoundException ClassNotFoundException(Throwable).(String, Throwable) line: 217 ClassNotFoundException(Exception).(String, Throwable) line: not available ClassNotFoundException.(String) line: not available URLClassLoader$1.run() line: not available AccessController.doPrivileged(PrivilegedExceptionAction, AccessControlContext) line: not available [native method] Launcher$ExtClassLoader(URLClassLoader).findClass(String) line: not available Launcher$ExtClassLoader.findClass(String) line: not available Launcher$ExtClassLoader(ClassLoader).loadClass(String, boolean) line: not available Launcher$AppClassLoader(ClassLoader).loadClass(String, boolean) line: not available Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(String, boolean) line: not available Launcher$AppClassLoader(ClassLoader).loadClass(String) line: not available HKServiceListener.run() line: 33 Thread.run() line: not available The class it's not finding is com.snow.IO.SnowTcpServer. I have included the external jar in my class path and have no compile errors. It only throws at runtime. I even have import com.snow.IO.SnowTcpServer at the top of the file like it should. Why is it not recognizing my class and how do I get it to do so?

I am using JBPM 5.1 as a component in a much larger application. Occasionally, for various reasons, exceptions get thrown from inside JBPM. Some of these are business-logic related and therefore something we can investigate (things like null pointers in process variables), but some of them are system related (like Hibernate Stale object exceptions deep in the JBPM execution code). I need to be able to catch these exceptions somehow, along with a small amount of process metadata, so that I can log the error in a way which allows administrative users to resolve the issue manually. Because the JBPM framework operates on IoC, I cannot simply wrap JBPM calls in a try/catch. Often, the stack trace doesn't have any of my classes in it at all. Is there some place in the JBPM framework where I can register a global "exception handler", so that I can write the necessary code to report in a meaningful way on any/all exceptions which occur in the JBPM space?
I have written an app that appears to work faultlessly on android 2.3. I have just been told by email that my app crashes (immediately on startup) on android 3.0 tablets. Unfortunately I do not have access to such a device. To try and make my app as crashproof as possible I have been employing Lint and FindBugs. My program does use more than one thread and Findbug reports several instance of "Inconsistent synchronization" because different threads may be reading certain data at the same time. I beleive this not to be a problem because at the times the data is being read it should not be in the process of being altered. It occurs to me though that perhaps android 3.0 has some built-in detection of such instances? I am interested in any other thoughts on what kind of things would cause a program to work on 2.3 but not on 3.0.
I am currently working on a Java plugin for Netbeans 6.9.1 using the Apache POI api for interfacing with Microsoft documents that has two functions, the first takes data from a properties text file and creates an excel spreadsheet(.xlsx) containing that data, and the second part takes text from a spreadsheet and adds it to a properties text file. When I run the code in the debugger both of the functions work great. The files get created and edited as they are supposed to, but I ran into problems when I created the NBM from the project and installed the plugin. The import (from .xlsx to .txt) does not do change the contents of the text file. I have checked variables at various times in the code to make sure there's nothing wrong with them there and everything was as it should. The export (.txt to .xlsx) works fine in the plugin, so I'm not sure exactly what's going on. When I start the import it goes through the steps, but nothing ever gets changed or written to the final files. I'm pretty new to Netbeans so I'm not sure if there is a major difference from debugger to the actual plugin that is affecting how the program acts. Any help
We have a bunch of pdf report classes which after a mass import of archived data have started occaisonally throwing null pointer exceptions when bits of data are missing e.g. thing.getOtherThing().getText(); will not have an OtherThing and the report will fall over. As I see it we have a few options Fix the data - not so clear what the data should be in every case and is a matter of human judgement in some cases Put try/catches everywhere and rethrow a useful exception to bubble up to the user - a lot of work and ugly code but usefull to the users Put null checks everywhere - no thanks Work on the DAO code to do coalesce/nvl in the queries and generate reports with N/A in the missing fields (or banks) - ok but no so usefull Or ... can we do something with AOP here? Is it possible to intercept nullpointers thrown in certain classes/methods? What level of information is available when these are intercepted? Bear in mind that multiple places in a method could throw null pointers :( Thanks.
I have an HTTP client in Java that I getting an SSLHandshakeException with a message of "PKIX path building failed [classname] unable to find valid certification path to requested target" I searched but all suggestions seem to be that the root CA is not in the truststore. Except that... I tried to add the root certificate to the truststore and keytool said "Certificate already exists in system-wide CA keystore under alias" with the alias name. And I got the certificate to try this by going to the site I am trying to hit in a browser (Chrome - but no browsers are complaining of any problems) and I exported the root certificate in the chain. Which I then tried to import with results above (I aborted the import at that time). I'm not sure how to fix this at this point. I note that the browser in the certificate chain shows a second certificate for the CA (so CA certificate 1 -> CA certificate 2 -> target certificate) and I guess I can try and import that one but I feel I am shooting in the dark here. Is there something else I am missing?
I have developed an application with Spring. I've a bean to create a thread, but during the execution of this thread, at runtime, the JVM throws the OutOfMemoryError - Java Heap Space. What I would ask is whether the following solution might be suitable to solve the problem: Once thrown the thread dies and frees the memory previously occupied by the thread, then I through another thread (which I call RestartThread), I realize that the thread is dead (without catching the error), then: 1) call Garbage Collector, that effectively frees the memory of the dead thread; 2) call back function run() of died Thread, that restart the previous instance (including private variables used by the died Thread, which remain in memory even after the generation of 'OutOfMemoryError') of the died Thread. What do you think of this thing, it could create problems? Is a correct solution to restart previous istance of died Thread? Thanks in advance, --Alucard
I'm using a Jetty based servlet to do RPC and I'm having an issue where a request that takes a long time throws the following exception on the server: 2012-02-11 21:07:07,673 [btpool0-4] DEBUG org.mortbay.log - EXCEPTION java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method) at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(Unknown Source) at org.mortbay.io.ByteArrayBuffer.readFrom(ByteArrayBuffer.java:168) at org.mortbay.io.bio.StreamEndPoint.fill(StreamEndPoint.java:99) at org.mortbay.jetty.bio.SocketConnector$Connection.fill(SocketConnector .java:190) at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpParser.parseNext(HttpParser.java:277) at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpParser.parseAvailable(HttpParser.java:203) at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpConnection.handle(HttpConnection.java:357) at org.mortbay.jetty.bio.SocketConnector$Connection.run(SocketConnector. java:217) at org.mortbay.thread.BoundedThreadPool$PoolThread.run(BoundedThreadPool .java:475) 2012-02-11 21:07:07,674 [btpool0-4] DEBUG org.mortbay.log - EOF I tried setting the Connection,Keep-Alive http request property but that had no effect and from what I can gather, http 1.1 (which I'm pretty sure I'm using) is persistent by default. So I think there are 2 ways I can try to address this: figure out how to prevent the timeout exception from being thrown at all Have the client issue the initial request without waiting for a response, and then ping with separate requests to check when the server is done. Update (2/12/2012): I set the maxIdleTime as Tim suggested and that did extend the time before the timeout occurred, but then I started getting a new exception: 2012-02-11 23:24:01,187 [btpool0-1] DEBUG org.mortbay.log - EXCEPTION java.io.IOException: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host at sun.nio.ch.SocketDispatcher.read0(Native Method) at sun.nio.ch.SocketDispatcher.read(Unknown Source) at sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.readIntoNativeBuffer(Unknown Source) at sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.read(Unknown Source) at sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.read(Unknown Source) at org.mortbay.io.nio.ChannelEndPoint.fill(ChannelEndPoint.java:129) at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpParser.parseNext(HttpParser.java:277) at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpParser.parseAvailable(HttpParser.java:203) at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpConnection.handle(HttpConnection.java:357) at org.mortbay.io.nio.SelectChannelEndPoint.run(SelectChannelEndPoint.java:329) at org.mortbay.thread.BoundedThreadPool$PoolThread.run(BoundedThreadPool.java:475) So something outside of Jetty was killing the connection, I suspect most likely a firewall. So what I ended up doing was making the server process the request with multiple threads; the original thread would immediately respond to the http request and a second thread would be kicked off to perform the action that was taking a long time. The client would then poll with http requests to check when the action on the server was complete.
I'm connecting to a web service over HTTPS. I've done all that I think is required to make it work, but in the end I get a handshake failure. I found out that as a new user I can't post more than 2 links due to "spam protection" - thanx a lot stackoverflow...anyway here's a link to a pastebin post with all the links spelled out...so when I write "link#1" here it's a reference to these links: http://pastebin.com/y4zGNRC7 I verified the same behavior using HttpClient (GET on the service URL) and actually calling the web service via a CXF proxy I'm setting both the keystore and truststore - I tried both the "in code" way ( link#1 ) and setting the system properties - i.e. System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore", "mykeystore.jks"); SSL debug is on ( javax.net.debug=all ) SSL debug blurts out the contents of both keystore and truststore (i.e. looks like java "knows about them") - link#2 seems like there's some client-server communication going on, but then it crashes for some reason link#3 I successfully connected to the server using the client and CA certificates both in a browser (Chrome) and using openssl s_client wireshark shows less client-server talk from java ( link#4 ) then for example from Chrome ( link#5 ) Another strange thing is, that I seem to be getting the same behavior when I set the keystore and when I don't (the only difference is that when I do the keystore contents get printed in the console, but that's it). I tried googling the problem and I saw numerous similar posts here on stackoverflow, but nothing helped. I tried changing the protocol version ("TLSv1", "SSLv3", even the weird v2 Hello). Any help would be appreciated - maybe there's some fundamental thing I might have overlooked...I'm getting desperate here... Thanx PS I'm running java 1.6 update 30 on Fedora Core 15 (64bit)
Sometimes when I examine a code I didn’t write, I launch eclipse in debug mode and use figures to understand a program. For example, if they are n items retrieved from the DB, it can be interesting to know that there’re n processed items in a service, etc. When loops are used, things get more complicated: if we’re in a “while” loop, the number of execution is not defined and if there are alternatives, the flow of execution can greatly change. For this purpose, I sometimes set a breakpoint in a portion of code and count how many times we reach it. Of course, it’s not very convenient and I wonder if there is a way to count the number of breakpoint hits. I know that Eclipse can suspend execution after a fixed number of hits but I just want Eclipse to count them in a normal flow of execution. I’d be glad to hear your opinions about it. Thanks!
I've actually got two questions. I'm work on a map application that will display the users position with a marker. Around the marker their will be an accuracy circle, and a text field. I can't get the program to launch on my emulator. I'm getting the following error: I have a copy of the logcat files if anybody is interested. The second question I have is about the approach of how I should go about making the custom marker. The marker is built from three components: Custom Pinpoint: an image in the resource folder Accuracy circle: A circle drawn around the image Text on Path: An Arc around the circle for text. I'm going to use the ItemizedOverlay class. Here are the questions: How should I draw this? I can create a drawable from the pinpoint, and then draw on it, or I can create a canvas and draw the elements on that. Should I be getting the canvas from a context? If anybody has access to any tutorials that are relevant let me know
Our development team hosts many different applications both .Net and Java based. Currently, we handle our error logging with Log4J and use emails to alert the development team when problems arise. Currently, we get thousands of alerts a day and it's becoming a little tedious to maintain. We've been discussing creating a central dashboard for all our apps. The ideal tool would track errors, warnings, info etc. over the life of an application (it doesn't necessarily need to be db driven). The idea is that the data can be viewed on a dashboard, drillable to specific errors with the capability of alerting via emal when triggers and or thresholds are met. Elmah is good for .Net but we need a tool that could also work for Java EE? What is the best way to go about this? Should we: Just use Elmah for the .Net apps and find something similar for Java and build our own dashboard to create a united look & feel? OR Is there a tool that already exists that we can leverage to do this cross platform? I've tried looking in Sourceforge but it's difficult to describe what I'm looking for.
I am trying out Soot for the first time. I followed the explanation on their website for installing the Eclipse plug-in. It seemed to download just fine. I then tried to create a Java project with a simple Java program so that I could try converting it to Jimple. However, when I try this operation or any of the other Soot operations, I keep getting an error dialog box that says, "The chosen operation is not currently available." Picture below: I am not sure what it causing this to not work. The Java build path (pictured below) seems to contain everything that should be needed: Has anyone worked with Soot before and encountered this issue? Any suggestions for how to mitigate this situation? Edit: also, when I try to create a Soot example project (a simple bodyTransformer), I get a "Problem Opening Wizard" error:
This is really weird to me, but looks like notifyAll()/notify() failed in my program. The code is rather complicated, basically I have three threads A, B, C A sends request to B and wait() on the request with a 10 secs timeout, when B finishes, it calls notify() to wake up A. C in a deadloop feeds a lot of strings to A through a queue, A picks up them and prints out. Each time A print out a string it sends a request to B and wait. So the workflow comes to be: C keeps feeding a in deadloop A prints out string from C A sends request to B and wait(10) B notify() A ...... A prints out string from C .... again and again .... This works in first a few seconds. however, after a while I see when B prints out that it has notify() A, A is still waiting because the queue which C uses to feed A is getting increased quickly, and no string gets printed by A. Finally, after 10 secs, A complains the request timeout. This looks like the notify() failed because B printed out message after it called notify(). Given wait/notify is radical feature of java, I can not believe it will fail. Is it possible?

I'm a final year student learning and trying to build a Java project and I've got a project in Java and MSAccess (jdbc). Th project is basically done but only executing fine under windows XP & jdk1.5. But I use windows7 64bit OS and installed jdk1.7. But I'm not able to login to the project. I've done those odbc - system dsn creation procedure both by *.mdb in Access02-03 & in .mdb,.accdb. but having the same Exception "unable to connect to the database". The login gui is taking the value of UserName and password, but as I press the login button it's throwing the exception. It is created in netbeans, though I have the latest version of netbeans installed in my system.It is throwing the same Exception from the commandline as well from netbeans. I have checked all those codings, dsn name, tablenames, ield names, but we all know that Java is a completely platform independent language. So I think there won't be any issues with the version of OS or JDK installed on the system.
C# is the language I am most comfortable with but do Java when at work. I guess you can say I am very comfortable with using the Visual Studio IDE. One of the things I enjoyed about its debugger is that I can put watch variables ("Expressions" in Eclipse) for any expression. So I could take a peek at values of specific fields public or non-public, call methods, etc. with no problem as I am debugging. It doesn't seem like I can do the same in Eclipse. I have to resort to calling the associated getter method for the field (assuming it has one). If it doesn't have one, I either have to temporarily add one so I can view it and remember to remove it when I'm done or I'm just SOL. How can I put a watch expression for an object on one of its private fields? Or am I just doing it wrong and I have to craft special expressions to view them? (Or is there a better way for me to get the information that I want?) e.g., I have an HttpServletRequest and want to keep an eye on the requestURI. If I just watch the request variable, it lists a lot of its fields and it's just too much information. I'm only interested in one thing in the object so to minimize this, I want to add a watch expression for that one thing. The field name is apparently requestURI so I added the expression: request.requestURI. Eclipse throws an error saying it's not a field (it is, it's just not public). Instead of going directly to the field, I had to go to the getter: request.getRequestURI() and that works fine. But I can't always count on the getter being available. The Variables view The Expressions view
Scenario We deliver a Java EE application as a layer between a legacy database-oriented application and a real-time Java SE application that manages physical devices to block or to grant access (like eletronic doors). The Java EE application is local to the customer. He manages the application server in his local network. Everything the Java SE do is based on it's internal memory. This memory is updated by the Java EE application thru JMS Messages. The Java EE application receives messages from the Java SE applications, these messages are mission-critical, i.e. they can not be lost. Once the Java EE receives these messages it persists it to the database. The major slice of our customers have a single database machine (not clustered, not HA, etc.). Our application should handle database connection failures gracefully, and it does. But this is becoming a really burden to our design. Every new thread (MDB, EJB Timer or WebService) starts by invoking a database check in an ad-hoc Singleton (i.e. not a @Singleton as we are using EJB 3.0). If database connection is down, the Singleton locks up (so all other threads waits until the lock is released), stops all timers running, and keep trying a database connection every five seconds. If a JMS message is delivered during this process, the MDB will be held to the Singleton's lock, so the message will not be consumed nor lost. Once the database connection is back up, the lock is released and the timers are started again. The MDBs are free to continue processing their messages. The architecture of the solutions looks like that [sorry for the poor mspaint drawing]: Why? We are doing this lock-based approach because on every tests we did, throwing an exception or rolling back the transaction at the MDB causes the message to be redelivered immediately. The redelivery count sums up really quick and the message ends up in the dead-message queue (DMQ). We need this message to be processed as soon as the database connection is up, so it can not be redirected to the DMQ. Dream We dream a world where it is possible to stop consuming messages or processing any other requests until the database connection is up. Once we detect the database failure, the entire application shutdown and focus in one little thing: to get to know when the database is back up. Once we have this information, we get the entire application to work again. Question Is it possible to have more control over the Java EE container? Like stopping or starting an annotated MDB at will. Or, is it possible to be database-failure-proof in a more elegant way? (Considering the JMS Messages are mission-critical.)
My application is receiving multi-part content through an HTTP POST, on WebLogic 10gR3. Whenever clients specify the charset attribute before other attributes on the Content-Type header (e.g. Content-Type: multipart/form-data; charset=utf-8; boundary=a_random_boundary), WebLogic is throwing the following exception (caught in my managed server's log): Unsupported encoding: "utf-8; boundary=a_random_boundary" specified. java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException: Unsupported Encoding utf-8; boundary=a_random_boundary at weblogic.servlet.internal.ServletRequestImpl.setCharacterEncoding(ServletRequestImpl.java:428) at weblogic.servlet.internal.ServletRequestImpl.initRequestEncoding(ServletRequestImpl.java:1115) at weblogic.servlet.internal.ServletRequestImpl.getCharacterEncoding(ServletRequestImpl.java:451) at javax.servlet.ServletRequestWrapper.getCharacterEncoding(ServletRequestWrapper.java:115) at com.MyClass.myMethod(MyClass.java:100) Just for information, I am doing a getCharacterEncoding() call to an HttpServletRequest instance at line 100. However, if clients specify the charset at the end of the header (e.g. Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=a_random_boundary; charset=utf-8), the application and WebLogic perform gracefully. According to RFC2045, the order of the parameters is not significant: The Content-Type header field specifies the nature of the data in the body of an entity by giving media type and subtype identifiers, and by providing auxiliary information that may be required for certain media types. After the media type and subtype names, the remainder of the header field is simply a set of parameters, specified in an attribute=value notation. The ordering of parameters is not significant. I have searched around, and the closer I got to a similar problem was the following thread at OTN. I am assuming this is a bug in WebLogic, but I thought I would look for some insight before contacting support and/or making a workaround. Thanks for any insight into this issue.
The requirements of the following java assignment are unclear to me. Does anyone understand what is needed? Assignment: In the previous assignment, you implemented a stack and a list that both inherited from the abstract class ArrayIntCollection. In this next task you are supposed to extend that implementation by making it throw exceptions. If you try to perform operations that are not allowed (for example, if you try to call pop or peek on an empty stack or try to remove an element from a non existing position) you shall create and use the exception class CollectionException of the type UncheckedException. Also write a test program ExceptionMain.java that generates and catches exceptions from your modified methods. The way I understand it, I need to create an exception class called CollectionException. This class needs to extend UncheckedException. (This part is not working, as I cannot find a class called UncheckedException). Also, it is apparent whether I am to use try\catch or throw for this task? Thanks to all!
In my application i am trying to handles Exceptions that can arise from consuming http web services , as i know so far there are 3 types of exceptions that can arise Transport Exception Protocol Exception Timeout Exception i am using HttpClient class in my android application , i don't have to supply login credential as a part of my http request so i think the Protocol Exception is rarely to occur , i know its not the only reason that a protocol exception can occur but its the most commonly one , for the transport exception i read that HttpClient is a robust to handle transport exception so it defects transport exception and retrying requests , so now for the timeout exception ( connections time out and socket time out ) is retrying the request is the proper way to handle these exception ? or there is more robust solution ?
I'm running into a problem with JAXB unmarshalling that I have no clue how to solve. It relates to unmarshalling SOAP headers. In my SOAPHandler, I have a SOAPMessageContext object which has a getHeaders() method. This method takes in a QName and a JAXBContext as parameters and will automatically unmarshal any matching headers. My problem is that I am passing the appropriate headers but the unmarshalled object is returned empty (ie: all the fields are null). I am a little stumped as I cannot control any of the unmarshalling; I cannot set validators (and see if there is a schema problem) or anything else as everything is happening in a "black box". All I can pass is the JAXBContext to the method. Is there anything I can do to figure out why the unmarshalling is failing even though there is no exception being thrown? Thanks, Eric
I'm trying to determine via InvalidAttributeValueException instance, what was the cause for the LDAP error code 19 (password policy error) so I will be able to display an informative error message in the UI. The current LDAP service I'm using is openLDAP (as an embedded LDAP in the application) and it provides a pretty informative message that was good enough to display (i.e. "[LDAP: error code 19 - Password fails quality checking policy]" & "[LDAP: error code 19 - Password is in history of old passwords]") But now I want to support Active Directory & other LDAP providers (that will be external), and from what I've seen in rfc2251 and various other sources - every implementation puts it's own exception message and the only standard thing is the error code 19 mapping to InvalidAttributeValueException and not to a specific issue. Is there a solution (even a partial one) for differentiating between the different causes of an error code 19? Is there a way, given an InvalidAttributeValueException instance, to query the LDAP for an answer to that question? Thanks
I have an extremely strange issue occurring in my application environment. I am using NanoXML on WebLogic 8.1, with jRockit 1.4 (jrockit81sp5_142_08). My first problem was encountering an IllegalAccessError on the class net.n3.nanoxml.XMLUtil. I thought it might be something to do with calling static methods within the package specifier, and it was. By changing this class to public, changing all its method to public, and additionally, moving it to another package I was able to fix the error. But after redeploying I encountered another error with net.n3.nanoxml.ContentReader. I repeated my 'fix' for this class as well and the error disappeared. So at the end I've moved the classes XMLUtil and ContentReader to package net.n3.nanoxml.util and everything is working! But I have absolutely no idea why! This code always worked using Sun's JRE 1.4.2. So my question is, what could cause such strange behaviour and what should I keep in mind while writing/debugging code for WebLogic and jRockit?
There is 3rd Party webservices hosted over HTTPS, while consuming webservice i am facing SSL handshake failure error. For security reasons we do no have access to 3rd party url or service, its only our client can access from there environment. I have done enough hit and trial but still not succeeded. Our application is running on Weblogic 9.2. 3rd party have provided the certificate (.p7b format). I have imported these certificates in the javakeystore (cacerts), even in the weblogic keystores (demotrust.jks), but still same error. I have tried different combination of importing the certificate in keystore, i can see the entry of teh certificate in the keystore as well. Even the stubs we have asked the client to generate in there environment(since we cannot acces from our environment), using HTTP stubs are getting generated but using HTTPS, it gives SSL handshake failure. I think if we resolve this issue, then application will also run. Application runs fine on http, but on https it gives SSL handshake failure error. I have properly converted from (.p7b to .cer format and then imported), even used .p7b to .pem to .der format and then imported in the java keystore, demotrust.jks, but still does not work. Am i missing any steps, please let me know.

The program I'm building seems to freeze at some points on the user's system. When I test the very same steps, I see no problem. Even though Java is supposed to be a platform-independent VM, my guess is it has to do with the systems we're using (I'm on linux, the user on Mac), maybe something with file access. I cannot access the user's system, and the user has no idea what debugging means. In order to test where the problem is, I was thinking of writing the program's progress to a file, and having him send me the file when there's a problem. Therefore my question: Is there some kind of library which allows writing the line by line execution of a program to a file? Ideally, the values of certain variables would also be included. edit: I'm familiar with Logger, but (like one answer says), that would require writing a lot of log statements. Is there some way to do this automatic? Maybe line by line is overkill, but something like log each method entry/exit would definitely work. Thanks a lot!
I am having a problem with Eclipse where I can run my program just fine, but when I try to start the debugger, I get this message The picture is a little hard to make out, but instead of getting the normal debugging window, instead it says it is throwing a ClassNotFoundException, and is trying to dislay the source for Launcher$ExtClassLoader. The thing that really baffles me though is that I can run the code just fine, it is only when I click the debug button that I have the problem. I have also tried debugging at the command line with JDB, and I got the same error. So far, I have tried Reinstalling Eclipse and downloading (what I believe to be) the correct Java Development tools for Mac OS X. I have no idea what else I can try, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if there is any other information I can provide.
I am calling a 3rd party report api to run reports. The api accepts a HttpRequest and Repsonse and writes the report to the response. There are cases where these reports take a long time to run( and a network timeout(5 minutes) occurs causing the browser popup window to stay blank. No "page not found error" or any other type of error is ever displayed. The client has a requirement to detect the network timeout has occured and show an error page in the window. Ive searched through the forum and i see a lot about session timeout. This is not a session timeout. Any ideas how to force my own timeout and redirect to an error page after a time of my choosing? Im using JSF 2/Richfaces 4.0/Webshpere 7 One quick note. I cannot change the requirements. I must call this api and i must display an error. I cannot switch to a solution to keep the connection alive or use any type of push

I have a jsp page which is used to generate multipart data (an xls). I am not getting any data at this jsp page but when i tried to print the data in log, I can see that all the records fetched. How is the request getting processed. Request ---(goes to)---> Webservlet ---(delegate to handler)---> Java Class(ReportHandler.java) Now we call a method of ReportHandler.runReport() which is responsible to get data from database. This method takes a long time (almost 12 min) to fetch the records. Once we get the data in result set, we pass it to jsp page and using the result set to generate report. 1> while(rs.next()) {system.out.println("<tr><td>"+partnerId+"</td></tr>")} I can see the partnerId - it is getting printed on console. But the jsp is not rendering the data on the browser. After 12-14 min, the browser show an error message (without status code), request times out and connection was reset. Now my question is if the connection was timed out at server then data would not be getting printed on console and if the connection is getting timed out at client end then how to fix it, I tried to fix the time out at client end by setting network.http.connection.timeout property to long but no effect. 2> I am using out.print(<table><tr><td>"+rs.getInt(partnerId)+"</td></tr></table>") to generate report but it is not generating any data on jsp though the data(out.flush()) is forcefully flushed. I am sure we are getting data at jsp page but it is not rendering because System.out.println() above is printing records in while loop. Please help as it has been a long since I am searching for a solution but could not get any clue to resolve it.
I expected this to be a simple task, but I'm surprised to find no answers for this. Let me clarify: I do not want to call adb logcat -c manually. In fact, I'm not even using the command line to view LogCat, so I don't think this is possible (edit: actually, it is, by running the command in a separate command line...but I don't want to do that). I'm using Eclipse to view LogCat. I do not want to click button Clear Log each time. That's what I'm doing now. I do, programatically or through Eclipse's Run/Debug configurations or however, want a way to automatically clear LogCat each time I hit Ctrl+F11 to run my Android project. My LogCat is getting cluttered. Ctrl+F11 isn't important - it's just my shortcut to Debug. I'd like to clear LogCat on Debug/Run. I'm using Eclipse on Windows 7 and debugging with a Nexus One (not an emulator). I've tried: Modifying Debug/Run configurations. (Project -> Properties -> Run/Debug Settings -> Edit Launch Configurations) Running from the emulator is the only way to add Additional Emulator Command Line Options. But I'm running from the actual Android device, so I can't access those options. Builders? I wasn't sure how to use this. (Project -> Properties -> Builders). How would I use this to clear LogCat each time I run? I'm beginning to think I have to write a macro program to hook Ctrl+F11 when the active foreground process is eclipse.exe to move my cursor to the Clear Log button and click it. I guess clearing LogCat automatically is too much to ask for.
Followed the instructions here and recreated certificates that I previously incorrectly created. Something has changed as I am now seeing javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: no cipher suites in common on the server and javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure on the client. Instead of the errors this question The server is ClassFileServer.java and the respective client SSLSocketClientWithClientAuth.java Any tips on getting the two ends to play nicely, note that I am using localhost so I would assume the cipher capabilities are the same. Update: Here are the steps I have used to generate the files, I may be confusing the key and truststore.: On the server (following by this guide): $ keytool -genkey -alias serverkey -keyalg RSA -keypass p@ssw0rd -storepass p@ssw0rd -keystore keystore.jks $ keytool -export -alias serverkey -storepass p@ssw0rd -file server.cer -keystore keystore.jks $ keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias clientkey -file ../client/client.cer -keystore cacerts.jks -keypass p@ssw0rd -storepass p@ssw0rd On the client-side (by this guide): $ keytool -genkey -alias clientkey -keyalg RSA -keypass changeit -storepass changeit -keystore keystore.jks $ keytool -export -alias clientkey -storepass changeit -file client.cer -keystore keystore.jks $ keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias serverkey -file ../server/server.cer -keystore cacerts.jks -keypass changeit -storepass changeit Had to use another medium as the debugging exceeded the body limit of this site: Client debug error: http://pastebin.com/mHCmEqAk Server debug error: http://pastebin.com/YZbh7H8f

I have an application i made using java and flex, that communicate with json. I have tested it many times and it all work well, but after some test it just stop working. in the debug process I notice that when i send httpservice request to my server via chrome I'm getting the HttpService post error 2032. I tried to look up for this problem and came across this: http://old.nabble.com/HttpService-post-error-2032:iostream-error-td16533829.html they say there that this error may occurs when the response body is too large. I made the response size smaller and it worked fine. this problem occurs only via chrome. in the Network Monitor view in Flex Builder i see the response with an error in the tree view, but when i change to raw view, i see the response body json as a expected and the header is HTTP/1.1 200 OK. but still the HTTPService invoke the fault function, not the result. the response size over 9Kb invoke the error. less than that is working fine. I'm running a Java server Tomcat v7.0 on windows 7 64 bit, and chrome 17.0.963.78 m. this is the error i get: [RPC Fault faultString="HTTP request error" faultCode="Server.Error.Request" faultDetail="Error: [IOErrorEvent type="ioError" bubbles=false cancelable=false eventPhase=2 text="Error #2032"].

We are getting a very weird behavior in our development environment that is consistent with all of our developers, devs are on different operating systems. We have about 20+ maven (3.0.4) projects in the development environment, all of them are open projects in Eclipse (Indigo) with sonatype m2e (0.12.0) handling dependencies as usual. (m2e 1.0 is causing us more problems than solutions) Out of all our 20+ projects there is one project that's acting weird. When performing "mvn clean install" on that project, even though maven passes successfully, it causes 4 java files (in the unit tests, if it makes any difference) to show errors in Eclipse. The errors of a "SomeNameOfClass cannot be resolved to a type" nature although opening the file and pressing F3 (Open declaration) on the erroneous class reference finds the class without a problem. the "mvn clean" is the problem, if we just run "mvn install" this doesn't happen. Eclipse's project->clean clears the errors and everything is ok. This is not an operational problem that actually prevents me from working or anything like that, I can solve it simply by cleaning in Eclipse, I just hate doing that every time and I can't stand red Xs in my projects even if they have no effect. I'm just really really curious why this is happening at all, why specifically those 4 classes? why why why? :) Thanks
My Problems: I can test successfully for CRUD services operation. I was doing an insert on @Before [setUp()] and delete of same data on @After [tearDown()] but going forward I would need to support Transactions rather than writing code for insert and delete. I am successful in fetching single records of my entity but when I fire a search query or try to fetch more than one of my entities I get: com.liferay.portal.kernel.bean.BeanLocatorException: BeanLocator has not been set for servlet context MyCustom-portlet I have followed some of the following links to set-up Junit with Liferay: Liferay wiki - How to use Junit to test Service in Portlets SO - Unit Testing in Liferay SO - Junit Testing DAOs rollback or Delete My Enviroment Liferay 6.0.5 EE bundled with Tomcat Eclipse Helios with Liferay IDE 1.4 using Junit4 I am running my tests with "ant" command in eclipse itself but not through typing Alt+Shift+X, T. It would be really helpful if I can get some idea as to how to go about using Transactions with JUnit (or at least some ideas as to how it works in liferay) and how to resolve the BeanLocatorException (or at least why would it be thrown) Any help will be greatly appreciated.
im learning the google app engine framework and service and for that i built the tutorial google itself provides under "docs" on their google app engine homepage. the tutorial is very simple, build a guestbook web app that uses a datastore to save "greetings" from users. i did everything on the tutorial by hand and everything exacly like they said to. it works just fine when i run it from eclipse, no errors what so ever. so i deployed it (with no errors, "deploy successful") just to see it running before moving on to more difficult examples but i get an error 500. checking the logs i get a: "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: guestbook.SignGuestbookServlet" thats the only servlet from the app, and it runs just fine from my machine why not from app engine? the mapping on the web.xml is right (just like the google one) and appengine-web.xml has the application name. what can it be? thanks in advance. EDIT: ok now i feel dumb. apparently i have to build before deploying, i thought the deply procedure would build everything from scratch for me, guess i was wrong. sorry for wasting anyone time and i hope maybe sometime it will help someone with the same problem.
Solr is giving out of memory exception. Index size is small roughly around 30GB. Full Indexing was completed fine. Later while searching maybe when it tries to load the results in memory it starts giving this exception. Though with the same memory allocated to Tomcat and exactly same solr configuration replica on another server it is working perfectly fine. I am working on 64 bit software's including Java & Tomcat on Windows. With smaller index size it is working perfectly fine. I was thinking of increasing the tomcat heap space allocated but then how come on a different server with exactly same system and solr configuration it is working fine? Any help would be appreciated. Here are the logs: The server encountered an internal error (Severe errors in solr configuration. Check your log files for more detailed information on what may be wrong.

I'm working on a Mac 10.6.8 with NB 7.1 and Java 1.6.0_29. Here's an example scenario: When I hit a break point in my code, there is a boolean member variable called traceEnabled. If I hover over the code with my mouse arrow, I intermittently get a tool tip message that says traceEnabled > No current context <. If I move the mouse away, then hover over it again, the true/false value may or may not show up. It eventually does after a variable number of tries. There is no change in the debugger between subsequent tries: I haven't stepped or ran or opened any watch windows or anything. Note that this scenario also happens with highlighted member functions and local variables. It also happens within the Watch window and the way I get the value to show up there (even though the variable is in scope and has not gone out of scope), is to step a few times. Has anyone else experienced this?
I'm going to be honest and say that I have never deployed an applet, but it seems to be incredibly painful. The <applet code> doesn't work on chrome so im using the jnlp to hopefully get past this nightmare, but it only seems to add to my migrane. Everything runs fine in eclipse, but when it comes to deployment.. I might be needing a new computer if I can't figure this out haha. Started out creating the java jar (jar cvf WebGame.jar bin): Then I created the JNLP file that looks like this (named bounce.jnlp): I thought I was starting to get somewhere when I created my html file (Bounce.html): So I decided to upload everything to test out how it works on chrome: It looked like my game was loading on the browser but I ended up getting this: So after messing around with it for a couple of hours I'm all like this: If anyone could help me out I would DEFINITELY appreciate it, (I can't really afford to buy a new computer at the moment).
Is there a way of debugging JSF + PrimeFaces applications by simply looking at one log file? To be more specific, here is how I personally do it at the moment if something doesn't work as expected: Look for visual indicator on the Web page (e.g. if I receive HTTP 500 obviously something is wrong) I look in the log file of my application server for any warnings, errors or stacktraces I look in the Firebug's network console to see if there were any errors in the HTTP response; this tends to happen from time to time (and it's not shown in the log!) I check if it is a validation error by including a p:message on the form and display it. For me, checking for errors is a 4-step workflow. Is there a better way of doing this? Ideally, it would be great if all these errors could be logged to a single log. Is this DIY or there is some standard way of doing it? Thanks!
I'm facing an issue with HTTP compression when using Glassfish 3.1 through 4.27. In general I have an impression it has never worked yet. Similar to the post here Glassfish 3 - gzip compression does not work for .jsp I enabled the compression in the usual way by setting compression to 'on' and specifying either default types any other possible combinations. I have also tried this solution with 3.1 - no change (I check the results with Firebug's Page Speed and YSlow): http://java.net/jira/browse/GRIZZLY-979?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Aall-tabpanel Does anyone face the same issue? I have been looking for over a for a solution, but nothing helps. These are the steps I already tried: 1) Testing compression with Glassfish 3.0.1, 3.1, 3.1.2 and 4b27 - always the same; 2) Testing with all kinds of combinations of mime type, e.g.: text/html,text/xml,text/plain,text/css,text/javascript,application/javascript 3) The same tests while running Glassfish on java x32 and x64 different version, including the latest one: 1.6 update 31 and 1.7.03; 4) I also tried setting compression to force and setting the compression limit to 1, nothing helps. Do you have any idea what could it be? I'm running Glassfish on Win7 with the latest Java x64 and x32 Bit. Has anyone accomplished any progress with this?
Here is my problem. I work on a synchronization batch using 2 EJB/JPA/Hibernate modules. The first module reads information in the database A and detects changes. Once detected, modified items are sent to the second module through JMS. The second module reads the message and iterates through the modified items and updates information in the database B. Once the update process is finished, a message containing the ID of the items successfully updated is sent to the first module who flags in the database A the successfully updated items. All the process works but I don't know how to manage exception that could occur during the persistence process using the container managed EntityManager. If I wasn't working with a container managed EntityManager I would open a new transaction for each insert and commit it or rollback it depending if any exception occurred. I need to know when an exception occurred in order not to add the id of the item being currently processed, and causing an exception, in the list with the id of the items successfully updated. Also, if I'm processing 10 items and that the first one in the list creates an exception I need to continue with the other 9 items. I thought that using @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW) in front of the persistent methods would solve my issue but it didn't. Is there a way to do what I need to do using a container managed EntityManager? Thank you.
I have a query regarding PLSQL exceptions and how to handle them in Java .I have some Stored procedures which upon some exception uses "dbms_output.put_line" to print the error messages. As I can't get these messages in my java "front-end", How should I modify my Stored procedures to get these exceptions? I can think about two ways but I don't know if these are correct and if they are used in projects. Use an OUT parameter to send this error message to Java, if the SP executes successfully then it will be "null", but in-case some exceptions occurs I will populate this with an error message from my PLSQL EXCEPTION block. RAISE the exception form PLSQL Exception block so I can get the exception using try-catch block of Java as SQLException Maybe there is some better way which I do not know about.. Kindly suggest me how should I proceed in such situations. TLDR : How to code PLSQL Exception block so I can handle it in Java. The actual way used in real projects by professionals.
I'm trying to build a rather longwinded chain of programs and libraries that culminates in using a speech-to-text API to run an mp3 file into human-readable text. I was surprised to find very few APIs that do this online - the only working thing I found was the speech2text project: https://github.com/taf2/speech2text which hooks into Google's unofficial Speech-To-Text API. This actually worked at first. I did a few manual conversions and was pleased with the results. However, since attempting to automate the chain of processes in Java, it's stopped working properly. EDIT - the following error messages are technically sourcing from flac itself, not speech2text. Attempting to convert these files using flac only and not speech2text also results in the id3v2 error message, so the error is not really to do with speech2text (although speech2text might be the source of the erroneous tags) Java reports this as the error (after having called speech2text using a ProcessBuilder and printing out the streams): /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_inspector.rb:50:in initialize': undefined methodfirst' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError) from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_splitter.rb:77:in new' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_splitter.rb:77:ininitialize' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_to_text.rb:15:in new' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_to_text.rb:15:into_text' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/bin/speech2text:11 from /usr/bin/speech2text:19:in `load' from /usr/bin/speech2text:19 However, attempting to run the command manually on the same file actually gives me this: ERROR: input file ./chunk-abortion-test-audio-0.mp3 has an ID3v2 tag /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_splitter.rb:59:in to_flac': failed to convert chunk: ./chunk-abortion-test-audio-0.mp3 with flac ./chunk-abortion-test-audio-0.mp3 (RuntimeError) from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_to_text.rb:18:into_text' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_to_text.rb:17:in each' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/lib/speech/audio_to_text.rb:17:into_text' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/speech2text-0.3.4/bin/speech2text:11 from /usr/bin/speech2text:19:in `load' from /usr/bin/speech2text:19 Of course the irony here is that I've actually cleaned the file of id3v2 tags using id3v2 --delete-all at a Mac terminal. So something screwy is going on. Can anyone suggest what might be happening? Also, given that speech2text hasn't seen an update in a year, I feel like there must be a newer speech-to-text solution that people are using. So if there's something better out there please let me know. Cheers! EDIT - Incidentally, if anyone's interested the mp3 file originated from stripping a .flv file using ffmpeg.
Does the proceed() method of javax.interceptor.InvocationContext ever throw any exceptions other than those from the target method or intervening code? How about InvocationTargetException? Documentation, generally, seems incomplete on this point. [EDIT] I am asking: is the InvocationTargetException what is 'ordinarily' thrown by implementors of InvocationContext? Or is the original exception usually re-thrown? Or something else? The 'throws' declaration allows all exceptions, of course, but I wonder what the 'contract' is? A natural contract would be to leave exceptions from the invoked target method unchanged. This cannot be expressed in the Java type system, of course. And it is not documented or anything. So, in principle, any exception could be thrown. An exception from the target method could in principle be wrapped any which way; not just InvocationTargetException. This definitely has architectural consequences. If there is no 'contract' for the implementations of InvocationContext, the exception system will become nearly useless; essentially, all we will be able to know is that there has been an exception. So I am asking about such a 'contract', i.e. expected behavior of the implementations: is there one?
I get an intermittent error when launching Eclipse with an open GAE project. It prevents me from building my project. I can sometimes get it to clear by deleting the contents of the "war/WEB-INF/classes" folder and then restarting Eclipse. Sometimes I close the project, close eclipse, launch eclipse, open the project and that seems to help. The error has been happening for several months and has persisted through a GAE plugin upgrade. I can usually get Eclipse to work eventually. Once it works it keeps working great until I relaunch it. I am using GAE appengine-java-sdk-1.6.3 GWT 2.4.0 Objectify 3.1 (love it) Eclipse Indigo SR2 Windows 7 64-bit It feels like maybe a race condition when starting Eclipse. Any ideas?

I am trying to run a Java webapp build instance but it stops in the middle of the build with this error: java.net.BindException: Address already in use:8080 It's obviously trying to bind to the 8080 port but another process has already done so and wont share. So, I checked to see what process is using the 8080 (netstat -anp | grep 8080). Apparently the jsvc.exec process is listening to my 8080 port. Upon checking (ps -fp) I find out that this is Tomcat (boostrap.jar). So, to see if the build would at least complete, I killed the process. And yeah!! The Webapp build installed completely. But when I navigated my browser to localhost:8080 it says the service is not running - coz I killed Tomcat! I even tried localhost:8080/manager/list. Still said service not running. So I restart Tomcat, checked localhost:8080 and Tomcat was back up. Checked localhost:8080/manager/list but did not see the Webapp instance I had just built. What I am not getting here! My webapp wont build if I run tomcat (cant share 8080). And If i kill tomcat to complete the build, the webapp obviously cant run coz Tomcat is dead. Please help me. Running Tomcat 5.5 in a LAMP environment on a remote server. NOTE: I am running a pre-built webapp build application (war) which I cant make changes to.
I have a java swing application which has a form that I populate by scanning a barcode containing tab (or $I) delimited data as keyboard input through a USB connection. Intermittently, the form's text fields are incorrectly populated such that it appears the tab is processed too late. For example, if the data set in the barcode is something like 'abc$Idef', the expected output would be 'abc' in the 1st text field and 'def' in the 2nd text field. What we see sometimes instead is 'abcde' in the 1st text field and 'f' in the 2nd or even all data in the 1st text field and nothing in the 2nd. I have seen this issue manifest at different frequencies across different days. Today could be good and I only see it happen 1 out of every 150 attempts. Yesterday it could have been poor, happening 1 out of 10 attempts. The scanner is at or near default factory settings with the exception of me toggling the parameter to implement tab vs $I delimiter. I have also attempted slowing down the transmission speed, and while that does appear to decrease the frequency of events, it does not eliminate them and the the slowed speed is not ideal for user workflow and so, reset it to full speed. I am doubtful that the issue lies within the scanner however. in the application, I've attempted to disable all text field validations and data backups to essentially remove any custom code which might cause some delay, but the intermittent issue still exists. Currently the application is running on a WinXPSP3 using JRE 1.5.0_18. The scanner is a Symbol model ds6707. I could use some guidance in investigating this issue further to determine where the problem may lie.
I realize that there are many similar questions, but most involve scaling down the bitmap, or explicit calls to bitmap.recycle() and System.gc() which doesn't guarantee anything (and in my case failed to prevent the error). Edit: I have also tried using isPurgable = true when creating my bitmap. Edit: Also, I have only tested this with Froyo (2.2.2) on Motorola Droid. Here is the scenario: I am loading one bitmap (width: 1500, height: 2400). This takes up roughly 14 MB. The rest of the app is minuscule with regard to memory consumption (easily less than 2 MB). I am using the bitmap with a transformation matrix to pan and zoom around on a surface view. On first load, this works perfectly. However, when I exit the app and relaunch it, I get the dreaded OutOfMemoryError. On third launch it works, on fourth it crashes ... and so on. I don't need to save state, and so I tried calling finish() in onPause() (as well as the recycle() and gc() methods mentioned above). Finish() seems to stop all threads, but does not clear the memory. I should mention that I am also using a technique which I found in a comment from this question. Also Please check this So, my image is loaded from the web, as an immutable bitmap. Its bytes are then saved to sdcard (very slow) just to be reloaded back to a mutable bitmap. If jumping through all these hoops is laughable, please educate me... For my case, clearing all memory allocated for the app would be acceptable (if it doesn't generate crash messages). Is there anyway to just totally clear the memory allocated to my app so that each restart is as clean as the first launch? Is there any solution involving tiling? Surely I am missing something.. since the image file itself (a png) is only a few kilobytes, and I have viewed larger images in the stock gallery app without this problem. Edit: I have determined the cause of the problem based on insight gleaned from @Jason Lebrun's answer. It turns out that the canvas I had used to draw on this bitmap held a reference too it, so that canvas needed to be set to null for it to be properly garbage collected. Hope this helps someone with a similar issue.
I'm trying to export a small program that I have made in Eclipse Indigo today to an executable, however, every time I do so one of two problems occur. The program uses one resource which I was hoping to put inside of the JAR but Eclipse will not put in the executable jar no matter which option I tick when I export or which folder the resource is in - the first problem! The second problem is that whenever I tell eclipse to "Extract required libraries into generated JAR" I receive the following error when I double click on the executable Jar: Could not find the main class: main.Launcher. Program will exit. I don't suppose that the second problem is too much of an issue at the minute but the first one is extremely frustrating so I would appreciate any help or advice. Thanks in advance. (Strangely, and even more frustrating, if I go through the same process with a project I made a while ago with a previous version of Eclipse it works perfectly.) The folder structure of the project is as follows: In the project folder there are the following directories .settings, bin, src as default. I have put the resource, which is a png in the bin folder but I have also tried it in the src folder.
I have a Tomcat 7 running in Linux that I start via $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh and shutdown via $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh from /etc/init.d All is ok except 1 problem. Sometimes tomcat does not stop. Although I stop it and I see in catalina.out logs that is going down, if I do ps -ef I can still see the process running. What could be the problem? How can I debug this? My feeling is, that this is related to threads. So the parts that are suspicious are the following: 1) I use Log4j's LogManager to detect if the log4j configuration has been changed, but I do Log4jManager.shutdown on a contextDestroyed ServletContextListener 2) I use H2 database and I see on shutdown: SEVERE: The web application [/MyApplication] appears to have started a thread named [H2 Log Writer MYAPPLICATION] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak SEVERE: The web application [/MyApplication] appears to have started a thread named [H2 File Lock Watchdog /opt/myOrg/tomcat/webapps/MyApplication/db/myDatabase.lock.db] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak. Apr 2, 2012 9:08:08 AM org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader clearReferencesThreads SEVERE: The web application [/MyApplication] appears to have started a thread named [FileWatchdog] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak. Any help please? How can I detect the problem here? UPDATE: I did a kill -3 as suggested by @daveb, and in the catalina.out I see: JVMDUMP006I Processing dump event "user", detail "" - please wait.

I would like to serve a status 503 error for any of my java appengine servlets which throw an uncaught exception. Currently they throw 500. More details on why: I have a client application that makes ajax calls to my appengine app. Sometimes appengine itself (not my servlets) will throw 500 errors because something is temporarily wrong with appengine. My application also throws 500 errors when there is an error in my servlet code and and uncaught exception is thrown. I would like for the client to be able to distinguish between the two because for the former it can do a retry where as for the latter it shouldn't. As such, I want my exceptions that are thrown to result in a status code other than 500. I know I can put a try catch in my doGet and doPost in my servlet but I have a bunch of servlets and don't want to put try catches in every single servlet. Can this be configured somehow?
I have just began learning Java programming, I have created a simple game using Net-beans IDE. I wanted to show it to my friends, so I built it into a .jar. As per the readme that Net beans generates, I attempted to run the .jar with java -jar "gameTest.jar" However I get the error: "Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute". And now not only will this jar not run, others that I have previously run without issue are failing in the same way. Fir example I have Minecraft, running off the .jar distribution so I can give it more memory trough a .bat file for HD textures. But it also generates this same error when I open it. And I know that there is nothing wrong with it. All the things I have found online about this error say that there is a problem with the manifest, however this can not be true for all the .jar files on my computer, especially those that I have already used multiple times in the past without issue. There must be something in the OS or java instalation that is wrong. Win7 x64 Java 6 x32 JRE 6
Is it possible to get the error code returned by the operating system to the JVM when a FileNotFoundException is thrown? The issue I've got is when trying to open an input file stream on a file when the file is locked by the OS causes a FileNotFoundException to be thrown even though the file actually does exist. If I try to open the file using some code written in C, the operating system returns ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION as defined in winerror.h. However in JAVA a FileNotFoundException is thrown with the error message "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process." What I'd like to do is add some logic to the try/catch to retry opening the file if certain specific errors are encountered but I can't figure out how to drill into the FileNotFoundException and find the underlying cause of the error. The only other option I've got is checking the error message description but it just doesn't seem the right way to do it.
I've been learning about JAR files and wanted to try and create and run one myself. I carried out the following steps: Created a project folder with a 'source' subfolder and a 'classes' subfolder I wrote 2 source files, one with a main method which creates an instance of the other class and runs a simple method in it. Compiled these to the 'classes' subfolder. I checked to see if they would run. They did I created a manifest.txt file and filled in the Main-Class: xxxx and hit the return key. I saved this in the sources subfolder Created a jar file in the classes subfolder by writing jar -cvmf manifest.txt zzz.jar *.class Tried to execute the jar file by typing java -jar zzz.jar This gives a ClassNotFound exception. If I try to execute the jar by double clicking on it in windows I get an errorbox saying "Could not find the main class xxxx" I've double checked the spelling of the class inside the manifest file and it's correct. Possibly important: I have to compile my programs using java -cp . xyz as there is an issue with my classpath. Does this mean that I need to execute jars in a different way as well? I tried java -cp . -jar zzz.jar but ended up with the same exception. Edit: I ended up starting from scratch and now it runs (with the basic -jar zzz.jar command). Frustrating that I don't know what I was doing wrong but glad that it is working!

I have a client/server applciation that communicates through JNDI/RMI/IIOP using, on client side, some Glassfish client code (NOT packaged as a Glassfish client) and on server side a Glassfish instance. I have some Glassfish multimode scripts that I use to make sure the domains I create on any machines are totally identical and correctly configured. Using that script on local network, I have already made sure I could access a remote Glassfish server instance from client code on my machine (that was quite a reasonable guess, however I tend to test all things I'm not totally sure of). Next step is to have that client/server application working over (I should instead say "through") internet : with my client code in my company LAN (in other words on my machine) and my server code on an Amazon VM running my Glassfish server. For some reasons, the remote Glassfish is running on a Windows VM. Obviously (as I ask that question, you can safely guess the through internet test is NOT working. And you're right. So, to have more guesses, I started SmartSniffer both on my machine and on server. On my machine, I can only see one TCP packet going to that server instance (and nothing coming back). On server instance, I can see one packet entering (the client query) and one packet exiting (the server answer). That server answer looks like this : [4/4/2012 11:47:13 AM:917] GIOP.......(................NameService....._is_a...................NEO................ª.......(IDL:omg.org/SendingContext/CodeBase:1.0............n........172.27.63.145.Ô2....¯«Ë........e........................... ................... ... ...........&...............(IDL:omg.org/CosNaming/NamingContext:1.0.

I have a small system, and I want to offer a product that can analyze errors / exceptions and suggest a possible solution. So I want a way to parse a java Exception (since I have them only in logs [I don't want to affect the actual system]). After parsing it, I want to save it in a DB and compare it to previously saved exceptions (in some format), so that I can find the closest matching exception. I thought about the following idea: "XException at A at B at C at D" will be saved as [XException, A, B, C, D] and I will be somehow searching in my DB: [XException, ?, ?, ?] which is the closest. For example: [XException, A, G, C, D] is quite good. What do you think of these ideas? Any effiecient way to parse Exceptions? Efficient or better ways to define distance between two Exceptions? Know any open sources that can do this - I saure haven't found any. Thank you.
I'm working with a a framework that has a Core application, and secondary applications that all communicate using JMS via ActiveMQ (through Camel). It all seems to work fine on Windows, but the moment I moved it to our CentOS environment it failed. Let me note that our guy who programmed it and who was our ActiveMQ guy has left so I don't know quite how to diagnose the problem. It seems to be establishing a connection but then does nothing else. It is supposed to begin an exchange of messages but it doesn't. When I set logging to DEBUG I get messages saying "urlList connectionList:[]" and "waiting x ms before attempting connection" as though it's not connecting. I've made sure there's no firewall, there's no security policy to block it, ActiveMQ is shown to be running. I've tried everything I can think of but I have no idea what the problem could be. Any recommendations?
I am implementing a 2-phase commit involving distributed resources. How do I simulate the failure of a participating database ? Pulling out the network cable doesn't work as it causes table deadlock. I am currently using hooks in my application code which throw StaleConnectionException at different points like before query execution, after query execution. My concern with this approach is: Is there a better way to simulate the DB failure? What happens to the connection object when DB connection goes bad? Does it retain its value or does it become null? What actually happens when application tries to reconnect to DB?What value does connection object get?Does it use an existing value from the connection pool? I would also like to test at intermediate points like during query execution, during commit (after prepare is sent, etc). Right now I put application into debug mode and step into the function call and pull the plug in between. But this approach is manual and won't work for a scale testing. Is there a simulator/emulator or tool which can help me do this?
I am using java with netbeans IDE and I am trying to debug to the output window. My log prints to the output window in run-order except for exceptions, which tend to print ahead of their order in the running of the code.

I am developing an application and normally portlets, in which a runtime exception occurs (such as null pointer exception), will be replaced (on page render/reload) with a small box with the message "Portlet temporarily disabled". But somehow my application doesn't fails on uncaught errors, but rather renders the page as if nothing was wrong (while spitting huge stack traces into console). You might be wondering why this is bad. I've made an error in a button action method, which resulted in NullPointerException when a certain input field was empty. Further on in this action method some info was inserted into the DB. The web form silently failed, which is why I pressed the button a couple more times. Then I entered data in input field and pressed the button one more time. Now the action handler method doesn't throw the NullPointerException anymore. However what happened is that handler method ran 6 times (once for each failed submit + 1). Obviously, ActionEvents which resulted in NullPointerException didn't get removed from the action queue and they got refired on subsequent request. This is not a problem if application did get disabled as it's supposed to. Can anyone help me with this? I need to either get portlets failing again on uncaught exceptions or some way to clear faces event queues after each render respons phase.
This is my first post here, I have been searching for solution on net for sometime now and so i will ask you experts to help me solve this issue. So i have CNR (Cisco Network Registrar) CNR uses WEBgui as their front-end application. So the issue is i get Access Error: 404 -- Not Found error and i am trying to find out what could have caused this to happen. I looked at all the post on this site and they are related to some sort of codes that needs to be changed in order to work. Yet my situation is different. After the software was installed i have not perform any code changes to the software. The only possible cause of this failure could be the JRE/Java updates. Now,From CNR documents it clearly indicates that the latest JRE would work with CNR software. So at this point i don't know what to do and i turn to you guys. 1.OS: Windows XP 2.CNR Version: 6.3 3.JRE Version: 1.6.031 - Supposed to be latest 4.internet explorer version: 7 5.login address: http://127.0.0.1:8080/login.jsp There has been no changes made to any of the .jsp or XML files. Let me know if you need any files or screen shots. mark
I have a Java app that sends email via Apache Commons Email. The app works just find on my development environment, but when I deploy it to the server, I'm getting an error that Commons couldn't connect to the email server. org.apache.commons.mail.EmailException: Sending the email to the following failed : 255.255.255.255 :587 ...Error authenticating with server. Just to be sure this wasn't my configuration, I've tried on 2 different email providers, 1) Our email company email provider 2) Gmail. Both work on my dev and both fail with the same message on the server. I've tried several ports and IP combinations. I've turned SSL on and off. I've checked with our email provider. I'm left with a configuration of either the server or the network. I work remotely so I'm not on the same network as our servers, but I the app works for me even if I am on VPN. I've used telnet from within the server and I can connect to the email provider on the proper port. Does anyone have anything else I can try? Thanks. Edit The error I'm getting is an authentication error. Could there be a security setting to prevent the credentials from being passed?
I've got a decently complex little game going on in Java (solitaire, essentially like the Windows version), but I have yet to do very much error handling. Almost all of the methods across my classes will end up either getting called by an initial constructor (eventually main()), a paintComponent() method, or a mouse event. So, my question is, is it bad practice to just use "throws Exception" on all of my lower-level methods, and only do a try/catch at my top-level methods to catch ALL the errors at once? (e.g. 3 try/catches - one for the painting, one for mouse events, one for the main method). I realize this prevents me from easily dealing with errors on-the-spot, but I don't really plan on doing that anyways. My error handling is going to consist of writing to a log, telling the user, and killing the program. Keeping this in mind, is there anything bad with doing my error handling this way?
Possible Duplicate: SSL handshake alert: unrecognized_name error since upgrade to Java 1.7.0 My J2SE app uses HttpsUrlConnection to access a secure location. It used to work just fine until I updated my JRE to 1.7. Now I get the "Remote host closed connection during handshake" SSLException. After running the app using -Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake, both under JRE 1.6 and JRE 1.7, my impression is that under 1.7 the cached client session fails to resume. UPDATE: I have come to understand that under JRE 1.6 my client app uses SSLv2Hello encapsulation. However it does not do that under JRE 1.7, which is most probably what causes the exception. My question is now this: how do I enable SSLv2Hello encapsulation for clients running on JRE 1.7? UPDATE #2: SSLv2Hello accomplished on JRE 7 via System.setProperty("https.protocols", "TLSv1,SSLv2Hello"). However this didn't make the handshake exception go away. Turns out that the true reason for the exception is the cipher suite. On JRE 6 the server picks SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 out of the client's options, while on JRE 7 it always goes with TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA. For some reason the server can't resume cached sessions using TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA. Problem patched using System.setProperty("https.cipherSuites", suggestedCipherSuites) where suggestedCipherSuites always starts with SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5. Any downsides with this approach? UPDATE #3: The SNI extension of the client is what bothers the server. See "Server Name Indication (SNI) for JSSE client" at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/enhancements7.html
I have posted recently same question, but not answered. Now I will explain what i want... there is an Audit Failure event in windows id: 4625, it is fired when wrong password is entered in windows log on screen, I want to capture that specific event in my java application. I have googled so many times but not found any answer. I found another way that, in Event Policy setting of windows, I search for Audit Failure Event, than I attach task to that event manually, so whenever that event occurs, schedule task runs my program (which is attached to that Audit Failure Event). I want that, can i catch that event in java OR is it possible to add entry programmatic-ally in schedule task that runs my task whenever Audit Failure Event is occurred. Any help will be appreciated, I am in this situation for 1 year and didn't found any solution.. thanks
I have a problem of debugging samsung tablet device on my ubuntu. in My case I am using: ubuntu 11.04 android-sdk tools version 17.0 android-sdk Platform-tools version 11.0 Samsung tablet 7.0 plus and 7.7 , android-os version is 3.2 when I connect my device to my ubuntu computer the command "adb devices" as show "??????????? device", then i cannot debug or install my application on the device. it was working for Samsung Tablet 8.9 and 10.1. I try to do something as below: restart adb server (adb kill-server && adb start-server) restart adb server as root (sudo adb kill-server && sudo adb start-server) check udev and permission to be "a+rx" then restart udev and restart adb stop adb (adb kill-server) start adb with usb mode (adb usb) Add vendor id to ~/.android/adb_usb.ini All of these solution is not work and I have notice that when the device is turn off and connected to my computer while is charge, the command "adb devices" is list as normal like "2E83E... device" and also the same as when I turn it on while device is in bootloader, after the device ready the command "adb devices" is show above which I cannot do anything with that device. I wonder if there are any trick or something that I have to do with android-sdk or with my ubuntu to solve this problem. Thanks you very much for adviser. Thanks Veasna.
Just to say it explicit, before someone gets me wrong: I´m not talking about a plugin for Eclipse. I´m developing a little project, which is just a plugin for another program, which is also written in Java (and available only as a .jar file). I export my project as a .jar file (NOT as a runnable .jar file!). This other program loads this .jar file. The thing is, the main-project isn´t open-source and the developers won´t change that in the near future :/ Until now, I made messageboxes (JOptionPane) and wrote log-files to debug my project. But right now, I´m at a point, where I would like to use the debugger of eclipse. The developers of the main-programm have no clue how to debugg plugins for their project. So I hope that someone here can help me. Since I can start the main-program via Eclipse (Run as -> Java Application -> main programm), by adding it as an external .jar to the Java Build Path, my first idea was to change the place where the main program saves the plugin .jar files (which can be done by configuration in the program), to the place where eclipse would create it´s "version" of the program (bin folder in the project-path). But then i noticed that it creates only .class files and not the .jar file itself, which brought the sparkle of an idea to an early end... So how can I use the debugger at such a plugin-project? Or better: what are the keywords i would have to look-up to find it out by myself, since I get alot of things about plugins for eclipse, when I search for it :(
When starting a Multicast java socket on windows I get the following error (firewall deactivated): java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.net.SocketPermission 230.0.0.1 connect,accept,resolve) at java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(Unknown Source) at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkPermission(Unknown Source) at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkMulticast(Unknown Source) at java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroup(Unknown Source) at ch.uzh.ifi.group10.client.ServiceBrowser.(ServiceBrowser.java:49) at ch.uzh.ifi.group10.server.RMIServer.startServer(RMIServer.java:176) at ch.uzh.ifi.group10.server.RMIServer.main(RMIServer.java:279) It seems like I am unable to join the multicast group because the programm has no permissions for the socket. The funny thing is that the same code works without any issues on linux (ubuntu 11.10). Also I have tried adding a socket permission to the security.policy file (Permission java.net.SocketPermission "230.0.0.1", "connect, accept, listen, resolve";) This has not helped either. I'm stuck as I can't find any other place where the issue could be or what I'm missing...any ideas?
I'm working with some very old, monolithic software that is basically a heavily customized JBoss deployment. Unfortunately, this means that JBoss can't be started from the "Servers" view in Eclipse, it must be started as a Windows service or via the command line. There are multiple WARs/EARs, but the WAR classloaders are rarely used and most of the actual class files are located in jboss/shared/lib as .jars. We need a way to run a Maven build in Eclipse (via m2e) and deploy the class files in the resulting .jar to C:/product/jboss/shared/lib so that when we start JBoss, we can use Eclipse to debug (as a remote java application). Ideally, the artifact that Maven pushes will not overwrite the existing .jar file that was originally installed. For example, if the Maven project builds an artifact named myjar-1.0.0.jar, we need a way to deploy the classes inside of myjar-1.0.0.jar to C:/product/jboss/shared/lib/classes so that they are picked up by the classloader prior to C:/product/jboss/shared/lib/myjar-1.0.0.jar, which was installed with the product. Currently, our (very hacky) solution is this: Under the project configuration's Java Build Path > Source tab, we use the "symlink" functionality under Advanced to map the Default Output Directory (e.g. project/target/classes) to a class folder (e.g. C:/product/jboss/shared/lib/classFolder). This modifies the .project file, which is checked into source control. We build the project normally with a m2e launcher (e.g. clean install). Assuming the Maven build is successful, we run an Eclipse project build. This pushes the class files to C:/product/jboss/shared/lib/classFolder: We restart JBoss. Since classFolders take precedence over jars, JBoss will load the classes in C:/product/jboss/shared/lib/classFolder, which are identical to the classes in our Eclipse workspace. We attach to JBoss and debug the project as a remote java application. Pros: We're able to push our new classes to JBoss and test them without backing up the original jars and copy/pasting the new ones by hand (jar hell). Cons: We're compiling twice -- once with the maven-compiler-plugin, and once with an Eclipse project build (Java Builder). The symlink functionality is hit or miss in my experience. Sometimes we need to do the refresh project/close project/build project dance to get it to work. Is there a better way to do this? I cannot force them to restructure the project so heavily that all deployables are container-agnostic WARs, but our developers need to be able to make changes and quickly test them without manually copy/pasting .jars.
UPDATE: this is not a homebrew issue, I can confirm this because I get the exact same error when run HBase from the apache source. Been struggling to get HBase on my laptop for testing. Basically I install HBase on my mac by using: brew install hbase but when I go into the hbase shell and issue a command I get this error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/zookeeper/KeeperException I'm tried to install zookeeper(brew install zookeeper) but still no luck. After reading into the message it turns out that hbase has its own class path and needs the included zookeeper jar's in it. I've been struggling with this as I use eclipse and just put all my jars in the build path, I never really deal with the command line. I did a search and the jar is in the directory(/usr/local/Cellar/hbase//0.92.0/libexec/lib/zookeeper-3.4.2.jar) but not sure how to add it. I've been trying every variation of export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/Cellar/hbase/0.92.0/libexec/lib/zookeeper-3.4.2.jar:$CLASSPATH(got the idea [here][1]) that I can think of but still no luck, I keep getting the same error. I'm wondering if I'm assigning the class path correctly? or if HBase has its own of assigning the class path?
My PC is running windows 7. I have three java files on the SAME folder in location C:\Users\L33604\Desktop\Java Files. One of the java file called DataLogger.java calls two other classes as in creating 2 java objects. The 2 other classes are found in CustomWiresharkLogFormatter.java and TextFileReader.java. I managed to compile the CustomWiresharkLogFormatter.java and TextFileReader.java by entering javac CustomWiresharkLogFormatter.java and javac TextFileReader.java through he windows command line interface and the class files for the 2 classes are created in the same folder. However, i cannot compile the DataLogger.java successfully. I saw this error when i attempt to enter javac DataLogger.java on the win cmd cli. I can run these 3 files using the eclipse ide. ERROR seen in the windows command line interface: DataLogger.java :18 error: cannot find symbol. //this is a line in DataLogger.java String [] unLoggedTextLineArr = new TextFileReader().readTsharkTxtFile(); Symbol class : TextFileReader Location class : DataLogger //This is a line in DataLogger.java DataLogger.java :28 error: cannot find symbol. String [] unLoggedTextLineArr = fileHandler.setFormatter(new CustomWiresharkLogFormatter()); Symbol class : CustomWiresharkLogFormatter Location class : DataLogger Symbol : class CustomWiresharkLogFormatter class TextFileReader 2 errors. How to i make sure that i can run the DataLogger java file that creates the 2 java objects from the other 2 java files using the windows command line interface commands??

My application is contained in a war file, built using http://ant-jnlp-war.sourceforge.net/. All of the jar files contained in the war are signed during the build process. I can successfully launch my application via a jnlp with javaws when I have the Java Temporary Internet File Setting "Keep temporary files on my computer" unchecked. However, when I enable (check) this option I get a com.sun.deploy.net.JARSigningException. There are many jar files included in this application which appear to be successfully verified when running the application. The offending jar file that is causing the exception happens to be the jar file containing the main class (has the attribute main="true"). If I remove the inclusion of this jar file from the jnlp launch file then I no longer get the JARSigningException (obviously the application does not run then). I have downloaded the offending jar file from the web server (as deployed) and successfully verified it using "jarsigner -verify". Has anyone experienced the Java cacheing issue? I have searched and found cases where disabling cacheing caused problems, but not enabling cacheing. Does anyone have any suggestions on troubleshooting paths? UPDATE 20120427: The culprit, or at least a contributor, appears to be the use of the Ant zipfileset task when creating the jar that was causing the exception. I was using zipfileset to package the WEB-INF/* directory and contents. As soon as I switched to a fileset task, no more exception. Hopefully I'll have more time to investigate what's really going on in the future.
What is a good way of having an actor try something again on failure, but with growing time intervals between the retries? Let's say I want the actor to try again after 15 seconds, then 30 seconds, then every minute for a limited number of times. Here's what I've come up with: the method of the actor that performs the actual work has an optional RetryInfo parameter that, if present, contains the number of the retry we are currently in on failure, the actor will send itself a new ScheduleRetryMessage with retryCount + 1, then throw a RuntimeException another actor supervises the worker actor, using new OneForOneStrategy(-1, Duration.Inf() returning Resume as its Directive. The actor has no state, so Resume should be OK on receiving the ScheduleRetryMessage, the actor will if retryCount < MAX_RETRIES: use Akka's scheduler to schedule sending a RetryMessage after the desired delay else: finally give up, sending a message to another actor for error reporting Is this a good solution or is there a better approach?

I'm using Eclipse to debug a web application through a local installation of Tomcat. When I start the Tomcat server through Eclipse and watch the catalina.out as the WAR file is unpacked, the Eclipse debugger will suspend and jump to a NoClassDefFoundError in the bootstrap thread multiple times (5-6) during startup. The only reason it's doing this is because I have explicitly set breakpoints on instances of NoClassDefFoundError. The application deploys and runs as expected, but I still want to know what is going on with the NoClassDefFoundError. catalina.out doesn't show anything about these exceptions and I can't find any information about what's causing this other than the fact that the breakpoints are being hit. Anyone know how I can tell Eclipse to show me the specific of the exception being thrown? I have the stack trace, but it's not very helpful since I don't have the source attached for the libraries that it's occurring in.
I am trying to automate some Weka classification using Java code. I'm getting the following error when I try to read my csv file: java.io.IOException: wrong number of values.

As far as I know, the csv file is no different from other csv files that I've successfully used with Weka. Any thoughts about what could be causing this error? I haven't been able to find a satisfactory answer on OldNabble for this - I've tried the one suggestion that I managed to find and it did not work. The one suggestion was to encapsulate the entries in double quotes - that did not change anything. Just for clarity (and because I don't know how to upload things), the csv files look like this: C1V1, C2V1, C3V1, ... Class, 4000.5, 3890.6, 2900.7, ... N, ... ... There are 97 entries per row. In another version, I have double quotes around the strings and chars (in the first row and last column) and, as I previously stated, that doesn't help. Thanks!
I'm using Eclipse to automatically create a WebLogic web service (not client) from a pre-existing WSDL. It receives 3 request parameters (String, String, byte[]) and responds with 1 parameter (byte[]). However the auto-generated class contains code that produces the following error: Endpoint interface method "public byte[] sign(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, byte[])" must be implemented in the Web Service. But the sign method clearly exist in the code. So, I tried creating a really simple WSDL to test the auto-generation of web service. This time the WSDL defined 2 request parameter (int, int) and 1 response (int). This time the error did not show up and worked just fine. Tools I'm using Eclipse - 3.7.1 Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse 11.1.1.8.0 Oracle WebLogic Server 11gR1 (10.3.6) Class auto generation done by Oracle JAX-WS 2.1.5 Windows 7 - 32 bit with 1.6 JDK/JRE Steps to reproduce the error: Launch Eclipse File → New → Web Service Project Import this WSDL to your WEB-INF/wsdl directory. Right click on the WSDL file name and click WebLogic Web Services → Generate Web Service Notice the error in the produced dss_DSSPortImpl class file. Repeat the above step with this WSDL and produced class file works fine. Any help is really appreciated. Thanks! (The namespace on the WSDL files have been changed from my test due to privacy reasons.)
We're developping a big Java application and starting to set up application monitoring, because we're detecting problems too late, and because parsing log files is boring. We already set up a POC on Graphite and JMXTrans. It's working fine and we're starting to have some interesting graphs. But I'm now wondering if we should use graphs for everything we'd like to trace. I think it would be fine to have messages somewhere, and basically, I'd like to go in log file only as a last chance to debug a problem. If I'm getting exceptions in production, I'd like to be warned automatically and know what's the problem is about. I found Sentry which is a webapp that collects traces from clients, and logster, that parses log files and send lines matching some patterns to Graphite. I think the philosophy of the first one is better. Basically, I'd like to dissociate what is traced from how it's going to be traced. We could use a logging facade like SLF4J, and then dispatch traces according to levels or some others rules (patterns in exception for instances) to log files, a NoSQLDB, dedicated tools like Sentry or Graphite, etc. So basically,what are you using for application monitoring?
I'm using Spring 3.1.1 with their OXM stuff, using the RestTemplate to post a request to another server. I'm using a class called ClassTermCollection as both the request and response sides of this, and it's annotated with @XmlRootElement, etc. and has been working fine for this until today. But suddenly we are getting the following error when JAXB is trying to create the request (that is, this error is thrown on the client side, before the http call to the server is ever made). Google reveals next to nothing useful about this particular error, and - even worse - Sun apparently do not ship the source to the class where the exception is being thrown, with the JDK... so I can't even debug all the way down to the root of this to identify exactly what's happening. Any ideas?

That code looks at the Result instance and, if it's StreamResult (as it is in my case) it tries to dereference the outputstream, writer and then systemId fields of the StreamResult, and it uses those values to construct a Writer. IF all of them are null, it falls through into the bottom of the method and throws the "unsupported format" exception, which is happening here. Above that, in the Spring org.springframework.http.converter.xml.AbstractXmlHttpMessageConverter class, we get to this line, which constructs the StreamResult, passing the result of outputMessage.getBody() to the StreamResult constructor. I'm getting null here, and hence the problem bubbling up from below. @Override protected final void writeInternal(T t, HttpOutputMessage outputMessage) throws IOException { writeToResult(t, outputMessage.getHeaders(), new StreamResult(outputMessage.getBody())); } Edit: Got this working... Sorry I took so long to update this, but I got distracted by work. Anyway, I forget all the details of what it turned out to be; but it was basically a crazy situation where a coworker added some code that subclassed one of the HttpClient classes, and his class didn't fulfill the contract of the interface exactly, and when called by my code, it caused this error. It was one of those weird situations where it looks like a JAXB error, but it turns out to have nothing to do with JAXB at all.
Situation I have a (Tomcat) Java web application using jTDS to connect to a MSSQL 2008 database. This Java application executes 99% of its MSSQL stored procedures using user input. Problem The jTDS driver replies sometimes (at different places in the application) with error: Maximum stored procedure, function, trigger, or view nesting level exceeded (limit 32). We can avoid this by adding prepareSQL=0 to the jTDS connection string. Then the error goes away everywhere, but with all other values of prepareSQL, the error stays. I don't know how many stored procedure nesting levels jTDS adds, but apparently it's too much for our application. Questions With only stored procedures to execute, of course using Prepared Statements in the Java code, how much effect does prepareSQL=3 (or prepareSQL=0) have for us? In other words: on every website I find people say "Never use prepareSQL=0 in production environments", is that also applicable to this situation? If prepareSQL=0 is not a recommended solution, a security issue, etc., we should maybe look for another driver. jTDS has not been updated the past 2 years and Microsoft has a driver for JDBC 4.0. I can't find any benchmarks or comparisons between jTDS and Microsoft's JDBC 4.0 driver though. With Microsoft's 2.0 and 3.0 drivers, the general opinion seemed to be that jTDS is faster, better, more efficient. Is that still the case with JDBC 4.0 or has Microsoft passed its competitor in this?
We are seeing this very generic error pop up in some circumstances, but we can't seem to track down what is generating it and I'm hoping someone has some insight into where to begin. We have multiple client machines all running the same version of our software, build with SWT, and all hitting the same server, but not everyone gets this error. Nothing is showing up in our client or server logs and I have no idea what log file this error may be referring to, so it's not an error that we are catching anywhere and we have no details about this. Since it's a pop-up message that leads me to think it may be an SWT error. I've seen people mention this error when using Eclipse, but I haven't found where anyone mentioned it in an application they built. I know this is vague, but I don't have much more to go on. Does anyone have an idea where to start looking for culprits? Thanks
As always, a lengthy problem description. We are currently stress testing our product - and we now we face a strange problem. After one to two hours, heap space begins to grow, the application dies sometime later. Profiling the application shows a very large amount of Finalizer objects, filling the heap. Well, we thought "might be the weird finalizer thread to slow" issue and reviewed for reducing the amount of objects that need to be finalized (JNA native handles in this case). Good idea anyway and reduced thousands of new objects... The next tests showed the same pattern, only one hour later and not so steep. This time the Finalizers originated from the FileInput- and FileOutput streams that are heavily used in the testbed. All resources are closed, but the Finalizers not cleaned up anymore. I have no idea why after 1 or 2 hours (no exceptions) the FinalizerThread seems suddenly to stop working. If we force System.runFinalization() by hand in some of our threads, the profiler shows that the finalizers are cleaned up. Resuming the test immediately causes new heap allocation for Finalizers. The FinalizerThread is still there, asking jConsole he's WAITING. EDIT First, inspecting the heap with HeapAnalyzer revealed nothing new/strange. HeapAnalyzer has some nice features, but i had my difficulties at first. Im using jProfiler, which comes along with nice heap inspection tools and will stay with it. Maybe i'm missing some killer features in HeapAnalyzer? Second, today we set up the tests with a debug connection instead of the profiler - the system is stable for nearly 5 hours now. This seems to be a very strange combination of too much Finalizers (that have been reduced in the first review), the profiler and the VM GC strategies. As everything runs fine at the moment, no real insights... Thanks for the input so far - maybe you stay tuned and interested (now that you may have more reason to believe that we do not talk over a simple programming fault).
I used Eclipse to work through the Google App Engine tutorial to create a guestbook. Everything works fine on my local machine within the Eclipse environment. I successfully deployed the application to Google App Engine. When I visit the URL (http://dcsnetlink-guestbook.appspot.com/) to see my application, I get the following error. Error: Server Error The server encountered an error and could not complete your request. If the problem persists, please report your problem and mention this error message and the query that caused it I did some research on the web to resolve this, but have been thus far unsuccessful. Please help. Here's what's in the log on Google App Engine pertaining to this.

I have a Windows MFC application that: (1) Loads the JVM (JNI_CreateJavaVM()) (2) Attaches the main thread to the JVM (AttachCurrentThread()) (3) Loads some Java classes and methods (FindClass() and GetMethodID() / GetStaticMethodID()) (4) Registers some native callbacks for use by Java code (RegisterNatives()) (5) Detaches the thread from JVM (DetachCurrentThread()) (6) Destroys the JVM (DestroyJavaVM()) All of the above functions succeed every other time I run the application. I know they succeed, because, additionally to the above, I interact with the application and successfully call Java static methods, and these Java methods successfully call my native callbacks. My application exits gracefully, and it is certain that the expected Java functions, and native callbacks, have been executed. However, every other time that I run the application, the call to JNI_CreateJavaVM() fails (not populating the JavaVM *). Absolutely nothing changes between runs of the application. I simply run it once (successfully, even without doing anything except the above 6 steps), quit gracefully, run again, and it fails, back and forth. There are no exceptions to the back-and-forth success/failure - I can run it dozens of times, and it oscillates precisely every other time between success, and failing on the JNI_CreateJavaVM() line. If necessary, I will paste more code. However, I hope somebody has an insight with what I've provided. (Note: this is a BCGSoft MFC property-sheet application, though I strongly doubt that matters.)
When I attempt to upload a form that contains an image and a regular form item, I get the following error : org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUploadBase$IOFileUploadException: Processing of multipart/form-data request failed. /usr/tomcat7/tmp/upload__275a1dac_1371dd097cc__8000_00000001.tmp (No such file or directory) It's failing on ServletFileUpload.parseRequest(request). I get no other information from a regular stacktrace. This seems to only happen for files larger than about 5k (sort of a restrictive limit). I have verified that the directory exists and is readable and writeable. There is plenty of disk space. I have tried changing the tmp directory, but get the same error for the changed directory. I have tried setting maxUploadSize in server.xml - to no effect. I am using JQuery ajaxSubmit on the client side if it's relevant, but I've used it in the past without problem. I'm at a loss and would appreciate pointers on what I can do, or at least what the best way would be to debug the problem. Thanks!

I've got an application which regularly submits tasks to be executed in a dedicated thread. Those tasks are FutureTask<V> and the thread is no more than an infinite loop which executes the jobs as they get into a queue, going to sleep if empty. Sometimes I need to wait for the result of a computation, so I call FutureTask's get() method, which will also throw an exception if something bad happened. But there are cases where I don't care what the result was, if any, but I need to know (log, printStackTrace() or whatever...) if there was some kind of failure during the task execution. Is there any way I could achieve this without having to wait on a get() that I don't need? Thanks in advance! UPDATE: Calling get() on the runner thread after executing the task seemed to be the only way to catch the exception if no one else would wait for the result. Another solution would be extending FutureTask class to provide a method which, via java reflection, exposes sync.exception private field.
Background I'm currently doing a benchmark of solutions to convert java code to c# We have a fast evolving java software and wan't to port some low level (not ui) apis with a tool, because maintaining all changes between versions could prove really tiresome... Anyway, I've been trying to use Sharpen, as I heard it's a pretty wicked tool used by some mono "freaks" to keep some versions of their tools in check. What I did For this purpose, I tried several tutorials I found on internet, the easiest to understand being http://www.pauldb.me/post/14916717048/a-guide-to-sharpen-a-great-tool-for-converting-java As the link he gives for a pre-build sharpen plugin is now broken, I build my own version of the plugin using sources and instructions found here : https://github.com/xamarin/XobotOS/ Result The plugin build perfectly, and is installed in my eclipse folder. But when I try to run the ant script after setting everything up, I get an error : java.lang.RuntimeException: Application "sharpen.core.application" could not be found in the registry. Conclusion Well. I'm lost here. I have no idea what that means. I'm using Windows 7 64bit I'm using Eclipse 3.7 I'm using java 6 sdk 64 bit If anyone ran into this and has a solution... That be helpful. Thanks in advance.
I need to develop some services and expose an API to some third parties. In those services I may need to fetch/insert/update/delete data with some complex calculations involved(not just simple CRUD). I am planning to use Spring and MyBatis. But the real challenge is there will be multiple DB nodes with same data(some external setup will takes care of keeping them in sync). When I got a request for some data I need to randomly pick one DB node and query it and return the results. If the selected DB is unreachable or having some network issues or some unknown problem then I need to try to connect to some other DB node. I am aware of Spring's AbstractRoutingDataSource. But where to inject the DB Connection Retry logic? Will Spring handle transactions properly if I switch the dataSource dynamically? Or should I avoid Spring & MyBatis out-of-the-box integration and do Transaction management by myself using MyBatis? What do you guys suggest?
In case of compilation errors, ant javac task will not compile all classes which can be compiled. It seems that the javac task (or the compiler itself) just stops as soon as the first error is encountered. The failonerror property does not have any impact to this behavior. I'm not setting the compile attribute (hence, the Oracle JDK's compiler is used). Is it possible to compile as most classes as possible in case of compilation errors? (preferably not relying on any specific compiler) One use case for this is during development: Imagine that you're implementing some new functionality but you're not finished and compile errors remain. In the meanwhile you need to fix some other bug and to ensure nothing is broken you want to execute the standard test suites which are invoked by an ant task in the project workspace of your IDE. The ant task tries to compile all classes/test classes but fails due to compile errors in the class you're just developing. It would be very helpful to tell ant/javac to not fail on compile errors in order to be able to execute as most test cases as possible.
I have a question regarding exceptions in a medium-sized Java web application. There is a data access layer implemented using JDBC with the logic concentrated mostly in a servlet (the UI is JSP). What is a conventional exceptions' hierarchy for applications like this? Should I catch the exceptions on data access layer and rethrow another exception for the whole (e.g. DataAccessException) or simply let the highest level handle them (servlet). Additionally, I have a connection pool that is called within data access layer and it has its own type of exceptions. Should these exceptions be caught inside data access layer and be rethrown as DataAccessException, or should be handled by higher levels directly? Would it be a good idea to have a main application exception with the 2 children: LogicException and TechnicalException. Logic will have the subclasses similar to AuthentificationFailedException and so on, while the TechnicalExceptions will be responsible for conveying the information about failures like a data access layer exception, FileNotFound (while it should be) and so on? Thank you!

I've written an eclipse editor for my own DSL. When an editor is opened or saved I check the contents and create problem markers for any syntax errors. The markers show up in my editor as expected, and also in the Problems view. I've got an extension point org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerResolution and provide an implementation of IMarkerResolutionGenerator which creates resolutions for problem markers. This works fine; when I right click a problem in the Problems view the Quick Fix option shows in the context menu and works fine. My editor extends SourceViewerConfiguration and I override getQuickAssistAssistant(), returning an extension of QuickAssistAssistant. This allows me to right click a problem in the editor and see the Quick Fix option in the menu. I'd really like to get the quick fix resolutions to appear when I hover over the problem in the editor, just like in the java editor. Currently just the problem text appears in the tooltip. Is there a seperate hook into this or should it be covered in two quick fix hooks I've already implemented?
I'm looking for some best practice advice here. I have a library that I'd like to add some debug code into (think System.out.println) that only gets executed if a flag is set in a configuration file. This is fairly trivial and will have the desired output for helping debug the program as I go along. That being said it seems heavy handed in that I'll have a lot of if(DEBUG) statements floating around my production code. I'm less worried about the efficiency of the code and more about the readability in terms of the statements that actually do something vs those that are just their for debugging. I understand that with most IDEs I could simply step through the code to effectively give myself a more manual debugging option, but I've found for any code base that is sufficiently iterative that method is more of a pain than just dumping things to the console. I suppose another option could be to use a logging framework that has a DEBUG setting, but I still feel like the extra logging instructions would be just as ugly as just shipping them to the console. Are there any options I'm missing here? Are their debugging frameworks in Java that make this cleaner? For point of reference I'd like to know when some specific methods get called and the string representation of various objects at different points in the execution. Thanks in advance.
I have a Java web application deployed on a remote server. I want to do remote debugging from my local machine from Eclipse. They are of the same version. Does the code need to be compiled by my local mchine for remote debugging to work, or is that not required? My understanding is that code should be compiled by my local tool. What follows is how I believe remote debugging works. Please correct me if I'm wrong. When I put the debugger on some source file at line 250 in Eclipse, it will look for corresponding byte code in the class file and note that point (say it is line 200 in the class file, as it removes all comments and dead code). Also it will put a kind of breakpoint at line 200 in the class file on the remote server. When execution comes to line 200, the debugger will stop, but in Eclipse, for developer convenience, it will stop at line 250 of the source code. (It must be doing an internal calculation to determine the exact line in source code that corresponds to the byte code.)
This issue is in a Spring MVC application deployed on Websphere 6.1. When I trying to access a URL that doesn't exist within the application, I'm getting a 404 error. I have an error Controller class that would log all exception and redirect to the error page. The Throwable instance is retrieved from the request in this Controller and this is an instance of com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebAppErrorReport. I find that the stacktrace elements as null when I try to access through the getStackTrace() method resulting in a NullPointerException in the logback API class during logging. As a result, the screen is not redirected to the error page and the entire stacktrace is displayed on the screen. Its working fine for other exceptions except the 404 error. I noticed that the printStackTrace is not overridden in the WebAppErrorReport and am using it to get the stacktrace written to a String for logging. However, I'm not quite happy with this solution and would like to know if there's any other better way out. Also, I'm curious as to why the stacktrace is null for this error alone?
This is an interview question, it has been done. Which of the following circumstances should throw Exceptions? Explain your reasoning. (1) Someone tries to set the capacity of a PackingBox to a negative value. (2) A syntax error is found in a configuration file that an object uses to set its initial state. (3)A method that searches for a programmer-specified word in a string array cannot find any occurrence of the word. from When and how should I use exception handling? " But if you get some invalid data from inside your very own program - don't throw an exception. If your problem comes from your own bad code, it's better to use ASSERTs to guard against it. Exception handling is needed to identify problems that program cannot handle and tell them about the user, because user can handle them. " I think : (1) should use exception, because the input is from users. The error is not generated from the inside of the program. (2) and (3) should not use exceptions because they are from the the inside of the program. And, the users cannot help that. So, we should use "assert" or "if" branch to handle the errors by the program itself. Right ? Any help is appreciated. thanks !
I wrote some code against the Java Google App Engine 1.6.4.1 API, and to get my code to compile, I had to handle lots of exceptions, such as ConcurrentModificationException. I upgraded to 1.6.5, and now I can just delete most of my exception handlers and my code compiles just fine. What is going on? UPDATE: several classes of exceptions are no longer being thrown; as this may have happened for different reasons for different exceptions, here are the Exceptions that are no longer being thrown by IllegalArgumentException IllegalStateException DatastoreFailureException ConcurrentModificationException Here is an example of someone getting an IllegalArgumentException in GAE: Google App Engine - "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: datastore transaction or write too big." Can this no longer occur? The Transaction Interface documentation says that you can get any one of the last three when performing a commit(): https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/Transaction#commit() Throws: java.lang.IllegalStateException - If the transaction has already been committed, rolled back, a commit or a rollback is in progress (via an async call), or an attempt to commit or roll back has already failed. If there are any outstanding async datastore calls when this method is invoked, this method will block on the completion of those calls before proceeding. DatastoreFailureException - If a datastore error occurs. java.util.ConcurrentModificationException - If some other transaction modified the same entity groups concurrently. And yet I am no longer required to handle them in order to get my code to compile. This seems odd.
I am in a very very upset situation. My program worked 100% fine when it is in netbeans, but when I build it it has some issues. That is, in my program, there is an one interface and 10 implementation classes. Program calls correct correct implementation class based on how the user save the file (eg: if user save it as game.yellow, it will call "YellowImpl.java", if saved as game.red, then "RedImpl.java" likewise). But when it is built, it is calling everything fine, instead YellowImpl!! Which means, if the user saves it as game.red, it will call "RedImpl" correctly and same to all other implementations instead YellowImpl. When the user save the file as game.yellow, the program do nothing!!! But this is not happening when it is inside the netbeans! I tried clean and build too, still not good! What is causing this ? Please help! However, I am unable to provide the code, because it has lot of codings PS: I am using some libs too
I am nearly finished with a program to convert HTML to a PDF format. My issue is more specific than this program though. I have an XSL file that is giving me some grief when I try to use it with my program. When using javax.xml.transform.Transformer.transform(source, result) I am getting the following warning and error messages due to my XSL styleSheet: Compiler Warnings: Attribute 'leader-length' outside of element. ERROR: 'Error(Unknown location): fo:list-item is not a valid child element of fo:block.' The XSL file in question can be found here: http://webcoder.info/downloads/xhtml2fo.html It is recommended by this tutorial: https://blogs.oracle.com/chrisf/entry/converting_html_to_pdf_using Any assistance with what/where these error messages are coming from would be of great help! I am totally unfamiliar with XSL files. Thank you so much. EDIT: I suppose it is possible that something else is at fault. Using other XSL files, I get: "Document is empty (Something might be wrong with your XSLT stylesheet)" However, I am following the Oracle tutorial pretty much to the letter. Does he have a bug in his code? (Within the link above.) EDIT2: I should have posted this in the first place: http://webcoder.info/downloads/xhtml2fo.xsl If that link isn't working, I'll paste in the exact code here. Thanks! EDIT3: This is some of the HTML I am trying to use as an example: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/classpath.html
In my JSF 2 based application I have a form that includes (amongst other UI components) some checkboxes. On the checkboxes I have registered ajax requests that fire when they are checked. The ajax requests will actually just update the value of another checkbox in the backing bean. As a result the other checkbox will also be checked (when it gets re-rendered - as it will take the updated value from the backing bean in the render response phase). This works fine until the whole form gets submitted and validation errors occur. Then the ajax requests still work and change the value on the backing bean but in the phase of re-rendering the updated checkbox the value for it is not taken from the backing bean but from a cached value that is taken from a ComponentStateHelper class. As far as I understand this is used for the new feature of JSF 2 to only store partial changes to the component tree. What I do not understand is: How is this related to the validation phase? Why is there a cached value in the StateHelperclass for my checkbox when the validation found errors?
I'm using the Javamail library to retrieve messages from a Postfix email server. I've run into a problem with some delivery failure notifications. I have tracked the issue down to the header parsing routine, where an exception is thrown when trying to parse the following header: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=----=_IMSS7_NDR_MIME_Boundary Having checked out the source code for the mail.jar library (version 1.4.5) the exception I'm getting is thrown from the javax.mail.internet.ParameterList(String s) constructor - the headers don't seem to get tokenized as I'd expect, it looks like the EQUALS SIGN after the four HYPHENS is causing a problem, since if I remove it and change the boundary to ----_IMSS7_NDR_MIME_Boundary the message parses fine. Is this a bug in Javamail or my mail server? I'm thinking the latter since running the mail through an IETF validator http://tools.ietf.org/tools/msglint/ it tells me there is an error on the Content-Type line. If it is a bug in Postfix, is there any way to fix it?

I have set up an automated deployment script (in shell script) for my web application. It uses java, tomcat, maven and a postgres database. The deployment script does this: builds the deployable application from source repository stops tomcat applies database migration patches deploys the war files in tomcat starts tomcat (by invoking $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh) exits with a success message It's all working and it's pretty neat - but it needs a little improvement. You see, even though it exits with a success message, sometimes the deploy was not successful because the web application did not start correctly. I would like to refactor steps 5 and 6 so that after bring up the tomcat server, the deployment script would "tail -f" in the catalina.out file, looking either for a "server started successfully" message or an exception stack trace. The tail -f output up to that point should be part of the output of the deployment script, and step 6 would "exit 0" or "exit 1" accordingly. I know that should be possible, if not in shell script, maybe with python. The problem is I'm a java specialist - and by specialist I mean I suck at everything else :-) Help please? :-)
As I am a beginner to Android programming, I was trying to run some tutorials, but upon running the programs( the source code is available here: http://www.androidhive.info/2012/01/android-json-parsing-tutorial/ ) I got an error. The program is supposed to read in data from a website and process it, but I think there is something wrong with the networking part. I am fully aware there have been similar questions here on SO, yet I had no clue how to solve it, perhaps anyone could give solutions which I also can understand. Strange NetworkOnMainThreadException in Android app? This is a questions which was asked earlier and is identical to my problem, but I had no clue what they are trying to say there, i.e. "To fix you just need to move any thing that is touching the network to its own thread." makes no sense to me whatsoever.. Can anyone please shed some light on this?

I am developing an application which has an image upload module. I have written the following code to get multipart form data. List items = servletFileUpload.parseRequest(request); I am using commons-fileupload-1.2.1.jar for this purpose. When I am deploying my build on jboss-5.1.0.GA server, it gives an error while uploading any file.

Scenario: For a web-site which requires registration based on user id, the user id must be unique. Lets say a user has attempted to register with 'foo' user id, which already exists (with other required fields). Now, without using checked exceptions (database API will throw SQLException for duplicate insert), I wonder how advocates of unchecked exception handle this situation and intimate to the user that the id was already chosen? Let's say this web-site is on Struts (no no, I'm not working on a project, it's just that I understand it better). User submits filled information to Struts Action which calls DAO to insert new record. So, ultimately, DAO will issue INSERT statement which will fail. So, if Action (calling DAO) does not explicitly handle this situation (DAO method may just declare that it throws SQLException or method may catch SQLException and throw a business-checked-exception like DuplicateUserIDExceptoion which extends Exception), how can this be handled with unchecked exception? Bottom line - I read many articles stating that Java does not require checked exceptions so, this scenario will help me understand it better, I hope. Please do not point to articles as I had read many, many and I'm really very confused. The best way you can help me is by providing answer to the above scenario. Note: I do understand that any recoverable exceptional scenario must be handled by a checked exception (which I have been implementing in my projects) but, I'm really confused by un-checked exception ONLY advocates. How do you people handle above scenario? Thanks in advance.
I have been developing an app for weeks on a desktop computer. I have moved to develop on a different machine , so , I checked out the code = built it, all fine - install it via pressing play in eclipse and it fails with a force close. Not great. So - This is the stack trace : http://pastebin.com/tUBAK1Zq I think this is to do with versions of the android sdk possibly - but the version I am running with is the same as on the desktop. The line the app eventually throws that stack trace on is : // Initialize a TabSpec for each tab and add it to the TabHost spec = tabHost.newTabSpec("replaylist").setIndicator("Replay List", res.getDrawable(R.drawable.tabview_changeicon)) .setContent(intent); tabHost.addTab(spec); Can somebody please help me get this problem fixed!
I'm working with open source project (axil) that implements a scripting engine inside of java applications and I've hit a major stumbling block while trying to utilize BigDecimal's rounding. It seems that BigDecimal is converting my input to scientific notation and then applying my passed in precision to the coefficient of the SN representation of the number, rather than to its non-SN representation. For example: new BigDecimal("-232454.5324").round(new MathContext(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)).toString() produces a result of -2.3E+5. This presents two problems for me. First, I am expecting a result of -232454.5 (-2.324545E+5), so getting -230000 throws off any math that involves the result. And second, I am not expecting, nor can I find a way around, getting the results in SN (though I expect there is a formatting method out there that I haven't yet stumbled across). Now due to the nature of the project, we can make very few expectations about what size/type of numbers will be getting passed into the round() method, so any solution needs to be highly modular. Does anyone have any suggestions? If it would be helpful here's a link to the google code issue report for this bug in the project. And here is a link to the project homepage. Any help is very much appreciated.
I have been given a task where I need to convert a C# library to a java library, thus I use a utility tool (C# to Java converter) to convert the C# code to java. However, the tool is about 60% efficent in converting the code. Thus for it I need to write the program which does the rest of rectification. To achieve it, I have used the Java Compiler API to locate errorneous code. However the error that is returned from Java compiler diagnostics is very generic, and it does not give a lot of indication to the program as to what the error and how would it be rectified? I believe Eclipse has a quick fix (hint and solution given at compile time) which in practicality achieves the same, thus is there any way where we can use the Eclipse API to 'quick fix' out code, and if not what would be the ideal approach towards this problem? I did look into Eclipse API but I was unable to locate the quickfix API.
I have an app which converts jTable instances into an excel file. In my previous question, I had a problem in using FileOutputStream() and it turns out that the problem lies within the AD user's privilege in accessing folders/files. Since my superior wont allow me to change the privileges, I resorted using the FileWriter() instead, which worked well. The only problem is that it kept on warning the users that the file they are opening is corrupt. Here's the warning: The file you are trying to open, 'filename.xls' is in a different format than specified by the file extension. Verify that the file is not corrupted and is from a trusted source before opening the file. Do you want to open the file now? I searched for a solution which resides in Excel 2007's file extension security. Info can be found here I made some configuration in the system registry of every workstation that the app covers. I just want to ask if there's a away to remove the corrupt file warning in Office 14, because one of the workstation, which is my superior's workstation, has Office 14. The changes in the system registry didnt stop the corrupt file warning in his workstation.
We have an amazingly elusive jvm crash occuring on an Ubuntu server that runs on AWS. Our JVM crashes while crawling a few web pages. The crash occurs at line 308 of the "safepoint" cpp module. At the stage where a gauranteeArmed==0 statement occurs. Our sysadmin has advised that , at the time of crashing, there are a massive amount of threads created by the JVM. We have not reproduced this bug in other Linux or OSX boxes. We use the Ning library to crawl a few Web pages. Related Posts How do I investigate the cause of a JVM crash? JBoss / HotSpot JVM crashing In each of these posts a "safepoint" related crash which comes from "nowhere" was observed. Most interestingly, the first above post actually exhibits a JVM crash during network related events. The cryptic nature of this bug leads me to believe that there is a bug related to thread creation and scheduling which is specific to our current version of Ubuntu with respect to the way java invokes some of its concurrency features, or some underlying library incompatibility that is highly idiosyncratic to our particular situation. My Question(s) My main question here is - what is the best method for debugging a JVM stack trace involving these "safepoints", and where can I get started learning about dealing with such errors ? There have been other questions along this line, but I have not seen a generic answer . Secondary, any insight into aws, java, networking, and how Ubuntu might behave differently in the cloud would be useful here.

I am having this strange issue with the tomcat 5.5 and tomcat 6.0 servers. I have two web applications which will be installed on tomcat.When tomcat is started these two web applications also get started simultaneously but sometimes one web application fails to initialize because of the init failure in one application another application is getting classnotfoundexception errors while running. In tomcat 7.0 the application is running fine even if the other application failed to initialize. After some debugging i came to know there is one jar named crystal.jar which is in the web-inf/lib folder of both applications. I have moved the jar to common/lib folder of tomcat then it started working fine. I want to know why it is working fine in tomcat 7.0 not in tomcat 5.x and tomcat 6.x versions. Is there any change in classloading architecture between these versions ? Thanks EDIT1: The library was in the location of both the applications WEB-INF\lib directory and they have no dependency with the external DLLS. Just now i read about tomcat 5.5 classloader architecture and came to know that every web application have its own class loader. The libraries in WEB-INF\lib folder and classes folder will be loaded into this classloader. The libraries whichever stored under common directory will be placed into a shared classloader. Then this library should be loaded seperately in seperate class loader of web application. There by even if one web application fails to start other web application should work independently. That's why i felt strange and need to investigate furthur.
I've searched this along the way on the net but i haven't found an answer yet.. maybe someone of you guy knows this. I'm developing a swing desktop like application; since I know that swing is not thread-safe (and if I call a method on a JComponent outside the EDT there is always the chance to get a deadlock with the EDT itself), I would like to have an exception thrown by the thread that is trying to call that method.. let me explain better: suppose I have 2 threads: the EDT and a background worker ("BW"). If I call, for instance, JButton.setText(), or JButton.setIcon() within the BW there is a chance to get a deadlock with the EDT. Now I would like that when the BW calls JButton.setText() and exception is thrown to indicate that I'm doing very wrong.. I see that C# on VS2008 does this by default (I don't know if there is a way to disable this behaviour, but I think it is very useful to detect bad code). Is there a way to achieve a similar effect in java?
I'm doing maintenance on a Groovy application which has decidedly substandard error handling- countless instances of catch (Exception e) {} all over the place. I want to implement far more fine-grained exception handling, but in order to do this I need to know which exceptions a given handler block can expect to catch- and since Groovy does not follow Java's checked exception rules, this is non-trivial. If I had a robust testing platform for this app I would simply remove all the handlers and then test it until I had a comprehensive list of ways it can fall over- but unfortunately this code is part of a rather messy distributed application which exists largely in production, and depends on custom hardware, so creating a testbed for it is a much bigger task than I currently have the resources for. So, I'm wondering if there is any shortcut (a particular IDE with the right magic, even) by which I can analyse the code and get a list of all possible exceptions a given statement might throw?

I'm working on a project in J# that parses large amounts of data from a text file. Java doesn't have a good way of checking if a string is an integer, so I'm using parseInt inside a try-catch block. I also have other try-catch blocks for file IO operations, etc. Sometimes I get CLR exceptions in other places where I'd like Visual Studio to break, even though the error is handled. To do this, I go into the Exceptions menu and check "Thrown". However, the Java exceptions apparently fall under CLR, but are not (ASAICT) specifically listed in that menu. So if I check Thrown for CLR, I get an error every single time an integer doesn't parse. This means I might have to hit continue 20-30 times to get past the parsing to the error I want to look at. Is there any way to disable breaking on Java exceptions while still breaking on CLR exceptions?
I am trying to use Portico in one of my projects for sharing objects over the network among the multiple instances of the same application running on several machines. I am using Windows 7 64 bit. So suppose there are 3 kinds of objects. A, B, C. Size of Obj A is around : 300 bytes Size of Obj B is around : 700 bytes Size of Obj C is around : 1200 bytes I am able to share the objA and objB between the applications. But as soon as I share the objC it throws an error in log that : Error in sending the message of length 1213 bytes. java.lang.OutOfMemoryError java heap space. I am also tracking my application's heap size in VirtualVM. Following is the info that I retrieved. While sending objA : Max Heap Size around : 64 MB Heap size : 2.5 MB Used Heap : 1.8 MB While sending objB : Max Heap Size around : 64 MB Heap size : 2.5 MB Used Heap : 2.0 MB NOTE here : The heap size shoots to 64 KB but used heap size remains almost same. While sending objC : Max Heap Size around : 64 MB Heap size : 64 MB Used Heap : 2.0 KB So, I tried to increase the heap size using the following command : java -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -jar portico.jar but then it threw and error : Error: Could not find or load main class org.portico.rti.Main Then I tried to compile portico on windows 7 64 bit, it gave me some linking error related to JVM. I am using the latest JDK 1.7. And I was using server VM as client VM is not available in 64 bit. So I tried building portico on 32 bit windows 7 using client VM. and it build successfully but again I was not able to locate Main class file in codebase\build\java\classes\org\portico\rti\Main.class. And hence, when I tried to use the same command as above along with classpath : java -cp ......\build\java\classes -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -jar portico.jar it again threw the same error : Error: Could not find or load main class org.portico.rti.Main How do I solve this. It is driving me crazy. Please help me guys.
This question is continuation to my previous question over stack overflow how-to-download-images-asynchronously-from-web-server . I am struggling to make the asynchronous list in blackberry. Now it is working fine for me. But it is giving me another problem now. What I have done so far Created a list view taking value from the XML feed List is loaded with default thumbnail Created RunnableFactory, limiting the thread pool size to 5 and then adding the runnable's to it. Runnable objects has the capability to download the image from server. Now list loads perfectly fine asynchronously. Problem scenario On loading of the list screen it is initializing the RunnableFactory and then starting download and render images in list. But, let say I have 50 number of rows in the list. And now 10 images downloaded successfully, and RunnableFactory is still in action. At this point press back key and then click next. Practically it should come to the list screen and then again initiate the download process freshly. But it is throwing IllegalThredState exception My assumptions on this problem As all the threads are running, I might have to cancel all of the threads on back key pressed. If this is the problem can you please let me know how could i do it? As i have created multiple threads how could i manage to stop all threads and then navigate back ? This looks like a more complex system. can anyone help me to understand what else could be the possible fix for this problem?
I've been searching the web for a long time, and it seams that this VerifyError isn't that uncommon and can have multiple reasons for tripping. I have created a project, that I've exported as a jar file. It is built with android 2.2 (API 8). This part works fine. But I have a separate project that when I try to import it, I start having problems. The only way I've been able to get it to work, is to import the jar into a libs folder I created. It then get's automatically added as an Android Dependency and I can use it fine, however I can't attach my javadoc file to it, and in my build configuration it says I can't modify the dependency. (Can't link to a javadoc). What I thought I should be able to do is simply add it as an external jar, then link the javadoc and source. If I do this, the code that uses the jar shows no errors, and the javadoc comments work. However I keep getting a VerifyError when I run it. I've attached a stack trace that shows the errors. I'm completely out of ideas, does anyone have any suggestions? Am I building the jar file wrong? Am I importing it wrong? If anyone can help point me in a constructive direction, it would be really appreciated. Thanks Stack trace:
I'm getting intermittent errors from devices connecting to my IIS REST service via SSL. My app works just fine, but sometimes I get this exception.

We're coding a Java6 project under Eclipse Indigo and we currently have some compilations differences between our dev environment under Eclipse and our integration one with Jenkins. Our Eclipse are under Windows 7 with JDK 1.6.0_30. Jenkins is under Linux with JDK 1.6.0_31 (also tested with version 1.6.0_24). The fact is that we're getting some compilation errors only on Jenkins, like: both define … but with unrelated return types when an interface inherits from two interfaces which declare the same method (with different but compliant types) no unique maximal instance exists for type variable B with upper bounds I,… for some methods that return a raw type B instead of more specific B<C>. The question here is not to solve this problems; with a few changes in our source code we succeeded in making Jenkins compiled. The question is: why does Jenkins compile in an other way than our Eclipse? Is there some magical parameters given to the compiler or the JVM that could make such a big difference?
I am working on a large scale application. I carefully try to handle all exceptions (and prevent them beforehand if possible). But as the application is large scale, sometimes some exceptions are thrown. When working in my development environment (i.e. starting the application from eclipse), I can see where the application occured, go there, and see what I can do about it. The problem is that - while developing - I have other people already "sort-of-test-working" with the application (inside the company). They give me a lot of feedback, which I like. Now if an exception is thrown in their application, there is no way for me to tell where this exception was created. I have seen applications that show uncatched exceptions to the user over a dialog. While I surely don't want this to happen in the customer version, it might be of great help if I could do that in the debug version. Is this possible? In short: Is it possible to catch all thrown and uncatched exceptions of a multithreaded Java application? EDIT: I was asked, how the code is run. I create a runnable jar in eclipse containing all the libraries and class files. Then I pack this jar into an executable using Launch4j. This executable is then used to run the application (it is packed into a setup.exe together with the ressource files using Innosetup, but I guess this is not so important). Codewise, I have a ThreadManager that starts all neccessary classes (including gui), but does not neccessarily keep a handle to all those classes.
Here's my problem: I want to make a HTTPS request on my server using a self-signed certificate. Works fine in WLAN with Galaxy S2 (v4.0.3), Nexus S (4.0.4), Xperia Ray (4.0.3) and Galaxy Ace (2.3.6). When testing in 3G, it works only on Galaxy Ace and Xperia Ray. On the others I got a Socket is closed: java.net.SocketException. On this page, I found a solution. I had a request property Connection : close. But without this header, I get a different error: Handshake timeout. What could be so different in these devices to obtain these different results? For https requests, I use the javax.net.ssl package. I use a client private key for the request. EDIT: I tested with others SIM card, that's weird: with one, it works on Nexus S but not on Galaxy S. With a second, works fine on everyone. My conclusion is: some operators may bridle particular requests or data transfert. I don't know why, I'll contact them to more informations EDIT2: Solution here: how to force my app NOT to use the 3g data proxy setting
I've been working on a little project involving Steam Condenser, a Steam API written in Java, but I haven't been able to actually do anything with it. I'll explain. This is what the wiki tells me: SteamId id = new SteamId("demomenz"); GameStats stats = id.getGameStats("tf2"); List achievements = stats.getAchievements(); The problem is, eclipse doesn't like it apparently, as it spits out this error: The constructor SteamId(String) is undefined and it gives me the option to change it to: SteamId id = new SteamId("demomenz", false); But at this point a different error comes out: The constructor SteamId(Object, boolean) is not visible So, I'm assuming this function is internal to the API, and should not be called from the outside. If anyone is familiar with this, or has a clue on why I'm getting this error (I'm fairly new to Java development), an answer would be greatly appreciated. UPDATE: The constructor SteamId(String) is undefined This is if I use SteamId.create(ConvertedID); (ConvertedID is a String containing the Steam64 ID). At this point I believe this API is not that well written, at least for java. Any other idea?
I'm new to this - I have never tried to put an applet online and I'm a fairly new programmer. I tried to put an applet onto a webpage; the first applet I tried didn't work (Hosted class on a google site file File Cabinet, didn't work because the FTP was ASCII and for classes that results in a magic number error) So I found a place that can host my files and so that the FTP was BINARY (Which is required for an applet class to work). I made this change and the applet was fine, working fully in a browser, and I was happy. So now I'm trying to get an applet that accesses text files (hosted in the same place as the class file) to work, but no matter what I try it can't access them. From what I've read thus far, it seems like I have to create a signed applet so that I can access other files, but that means I have to make a jar file which I cannot do because this is an applet, no main method. in short: I have an applet that tries to access other text files and it's not working (error in title) I may have made a mistake somewhere, and if so - any help would be appreciated.

We are experiencing problems with one of our apps in prod. VM is configured as follows -XX:MaxPermSize=300M -Xms2560M -Xmx2560M -Xloggc:/app/log/gc-admin-20120619-123754.log -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=80 -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:CMSMaxAbortablePrecleanTime=8000 Two options which i have missed and will be applied are XX:PermSize - Should be the same as MaxPermSize (recommended) UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly when CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction is used, otherwise the value you specify does not stick!! However with these changes in the pipleline im not so confident it will solve my problem. Im seeing concurrent mode failures but when a failure happens, the stop the world collection takes an eternity. At the moment im a bit bemused to as to why!! Here are some samples 168427.476: [GC [1 CMS-initial-mark: 2135988K(2578880K)] 2141041K(2617216K), 3.1029210 secs] [Times: user=0.02 sys=0.01, real=3.10 secs] 168430.596: [CMS-concurrent-mark-start] 168441.309: [GC 168441.309: [ParNew: 36520K->36520K(38336K), 0.0000210 secs]168441.309: [CMS168747.453: [CMS-concurrent-mark: 309.313/316.857 secs] [Times: user=5.75 sys=2.89, real=316.81 secs] (concurrent mode failure): 2561882K->1310927K(2578880K), 767.0309740 secs] 2598402K->1310927K(2617216K), [CMS Perm : 96774K->96171K(158792K)], 767.0379030 secs] [Times: user=3.87 sys=5.06, real=766.92 secs] What worries me about the whole STW collection is the timing 766.92secs but only "user=3.87 sys=5.06" of CPU time so what is happening here for the rest of the time??

Im going to lower the threshold CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction but i dont think with a collections time like that it is going to help!! Some collections run smooth and some dont but like i said, its the timing that has me worried when a full stop the world happens. I have read https://blogs.oracle.com/jonthecollector/entry/what_the_heck_s_a And we are using jdk6. Anybody ever experience something similar before?
Just been playing around for the first time with IntelliJ IDEA Community edition, first time I have worked with it so if I'm missing something, please excuse me. I have a bunch of unit tests which I run, however, when running them in IntelliJ (with the standard setup out of the box), I intermittently get the following error in the console: 03:14:17 Failed to start: 58 passed, 1 not started I have searched the web but to no avail. If I run just the test that failed, it may or may not print out a similar error: 03:19:54 Failed to start: 0 passed, 1 not started If I keep trying, eventually it works and tells me that all of my tests have passed. The image is not the error as an exclamation mark, it is a different error icon (), which I do not recognise. The error in Event Log window appears as red text. It always appears to happen with only one test and it is always the same test for any given set of tests. I.E. In a different project, the same issue also appears, but for a different test (but its always the same one in each project or set of tests). One more thing to note is that this ONLY happens when debugging and not when running, so it may be something to do with connecting the debugger? It all works perfectly fine with Eclipse. Any ideas what could be causing this? Many thanks!
If I go into Google Webmaster Tools, and click Health->Crawl Errors, I noticed that our site has about 1,045 Not Found errors. Each of these errors can be fixed manually by: filtering through the list to find the specified error that has been needs to be fixed, and clicking on it. In the resulting dialog clicking the Fetch as Google link, Clicking Fetch And finally, clicking submit the index (provided there are enough fetches remaining to do so), and then marking it as fixed. Since there are about 1,000 errors to fix, doing this manually seems a bit out of the question. (Note: I didn't have anything to do with it but the site was migrated before the content causing the errors.) I'm aware that it is possible to retrieve a list of site errors, but that's really only half the battle. I looked over the APIs and didn't really find a way to use the Webmaster Tools API to mark errors as fixed.
I am currently taking a class away from school and my professor is not helpful, so I was wondering if anyone can give me pointers on what to do. The instructions were given to me as follows: You can create your own list class (MyList) which will be able to hold any number of items up to the actual size of the array. Your class will maintain a counter of the actual number of items stored in the array. The array will be of type Object so that your array can contain any Object or subclass of Object. Your class should provide the following methods: void append(Object o) – appends the object onto the end of the list. Throws a ListFullException if the list is full. Object at(int index) – returns the object at the indicated position or throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is not valid. void remove(int index) – remove the element at the index and moves elements after it down to fill the empty space. Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is not valid and ListEmptyException if the list is empty and there is nothing to remove. MyList(int size) – constructor which takes the size to make the array.
Ok so I have wrote a C# driver(Driver as in dummy program to call a stub not a device driver) program which invokes a C wrapper DLL and the C wrapper DLL invokes a java jar file through JNI which actually does most of the work. All 3 programs are 32 bit. This is done so as to integrate with another vendor which is supposed to do the C# as well as C program which calls our C DLL. My sample test C# to C to Java program works fine but the problem is however, that when the vendor's actual C# program invokes our program, the Hotspot JVM either fails initialize outright or if it initializes properly, during the invocation of our function, it throws an OutOfMemory error. When I tried using JRockit JVM which does not need a contiguous heap space, the JVM causes the program to crash outright. Development Platform is Windows 7 64 bit OS. Core i7, 8GB RAM Actual programs have to be 32 bit for backwards compatibility to older hardware/OS. From my understanding, a 32 bit process normally has up to 2 GB of address space available to it. The peak total size taken from task manager that my driver program takes up is 256MB. The vendor's C# programs loads quite a number of other libraries but I highly doubt that they would occupy more than 700MB. What could be the issue here? Is it that the address space is not contiguous? But if that is the case, why did JRockit crash outright since it can handle non-contiguous address spaces?
I have a Spring MVC application which uses FreeMarker as View technology (But maybe the view technology doesn't really matter for my question). I need to intercept all exceptions which may get thrown during a request. I have implemented a HandlerExceptionResolver but this resolver is only executed when the exception occurs within a controller. But when a controller returns a ModelAndView and the exception occurs while rendering the view (Because a variable was not found or something like this) then the exception resolver is not called and instead I get a stack trace in the browser window. I also tried using an exception handler method within the controller which returns the view and annotated it with @ExceptionHandler but this also doesn't work (Most likely again because the exception is not thrown in the controller but in the view). So is there some Spring mechanism where I can register an exception handler which captures view errors?
I'm following a basic tutorial for the android jni development at http://permadi.com/blog/2011/12/running-android-ndk-examples-using-eclipse-and-sequoyah/. Before moving to problem I solved building error by setting "cmd F:\Android\android-ndk-r8\ndk-build" to build command. Changed build command Hope it's not wrong. But now it gives following error. Iv'e added logcat here. I can see two exceptions are shown here as java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError and java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError. I can't figure out what is really caused. It is said that you can fix UnsatisfiedLinkError by adding libJniTest.so to correct path. But i can't find it. I've run a search on my windows machine to find libjnitest.so but it is nowhere. Is it the problem and if it is someone can say where it should be. There are more than thousand questions as same as this but i'm no where to figure it out solution after spending several hours. Here is my code. Java code Please note that iv'e commented native function call but i can see problem is with the loading library. Native code Here i add the folder structure.
I've encounted an error trying to implement Apache commons-compress in my Java application: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveEntry" I have the exact same issue described in this post, except I'm not using Bukkit (whatever that is). The [expletive] OP left an infuriating last post, "Regardless, I found a solution. Case closed!" instead of sharing the solution, so I have no idea what (s)he did to resolve it. I'm not using ArchiveEntry, but rather, TarArchiveEntry, which I assume imports ArchiveEntry. Even if I import the supposedly missing class, Eclipse warns of an unused import. Curiously, if I remove my TarArchiveEntry import, the warning disappears, but the line containing the reference to TarArchiveEntry errors. I've never experienced this issue before. It would seem that the TarArchiveEntry class contains an error and fails to import ArchiveEntry, but I can't see a widely used library such as apache commons containing such an elementary error. Is there anything wrong with my implimentation?
I have researched several examples similar to this issue but i have yet to find one that is the solution to my problem. I am simply trying to do my first program using Native methods. I don't have the program stored in a hiearchy of packages because i tried to keep it as simple as possible for my first example. Here is how everything is stored: I Have one class called NativeDemo. It is stored in C:/JavaFiles/demo/. I compiled the program and the .class file is stored in this same folder. When I try to invoke the javah command on this program it tells me the class file can't be found. Can you please tell me what I am doing wrong? My javah command is stored in my JDK and is stored as follows: C:/jdk1.0.7_04/bin/ On the command line from the command prompt I type: C:\JavaFiles\demo>C:\jdk1.7.0_04\bin\javah -jni NativeDemo also tried C:\JavaFiles\demo>C:\jdk1.7.0_04\bin\javah.exe -jni NativeDemo When I do this it tells me the class file can't be found. This is the same path used when compiled and it found the file, compiled, and created the .class file with no issues. Please help. Thanks.
Ok, here's the situation: I have three files: 1. TScan.java 2. Test.java 3. ScanServlet.java I write my mail class, TScan in the TScan.java file, and inside that class, there is a nested class (not a sub-class), called TEntry. TScan has a main() used for testing and other methods that use the nested TEntry class with no problems. Also, Test.java is a fancier testing program that uses items from TScan.java, including the TScan and TEntry classes with no problems. TScan.java and Test.java were developed and tested in Eclipse (and it compiles/runs fine from the command line as well). So TScan is working to a useful point, and I wanted to include it in a webapp. Installed Jetty and wrote ScanServlet.java, which runs in Jetty, no problems. I started referencing TScan and it started giving the error above for TScan. Changing the ClassPath to include the TScan.class file didn't work, so I made a JAR file and stuck it in the WEB-INF/lib/ folder of the WebApp, and now ScanServlet compiles filen, and seems to find TScan at run-time, however it gives the NoClassDefFounfError TScan$TEntry at run-time. This doesn't make sense to me, since: 1. Obviously it's finding the TScan class now (Since it's not complaining about that at compile or run-time) 2. The error occurs in the TScan.java file (TEntry isn't reference directly except by TScan), which runs fine in stand-alone mode! 3. I made TEntry public, and it still doesn't work. I have found a lot of questions about NoClassDefFoundError, but none dealing with nested classes, especially with Jetty. Bear in mind I am more used to Delphi, where if it compiles, it runs. (And ABAP which is more or less the same). If someone has a solution I will be thrilled, otherwise, I am considering: Copy-Paste the whole TScan into ScanServlet (Shouldn't have a problem finding it if it's in the same file!) (not very modular) Move TEntry into a separate class in a separate .java file? (May be a pain to cleanly extract). Have ScanServlet call TScan.Java as a command line program. (Slow...)
Consider any of 'remote' exceptions: javax.jms.JMSException or java.rmi.RemoteException both exclude from common pattern of exception chaining by for having detail or linked exception properties. When you print stack trace containing one of this exceptions you'll get trimmed stack trace. To get full stack trace you need additional dancing with tambourines. What is the reason remote exceptions to be designed this way? EDIT: I'm browsing sources of java 1.6.0_26. Look on two arguments constructor public RemoteException(String s, Throwable cause) of java.rmi.RemoteException. You can see next code initCause(null); // Disallow subsequent initCause. This seems to be intentional decision in Java SE 6 to do that. But acording to common practice initCause() has it's grand purpose to construct exceptions chain! I don't remember the source but I'm confident about best practice of creating custom exception: 1. Expose all of the constructors of super class 2. Don't brake exceptions chain (call Throwable.initCause() in other words). This could be simply achived by calling super constructor. Thanks.
Does anyone know if there is a way to generate different code in the catch block automatically depending on the exception? The Eclipse function 'Surround with try/catch' generates a try/catch block which just includes dumping a stack trace. I'm doing a bunch of similar things in the code and so most of my exceptions will boil down to probably three or so different types. I'd like to have different catch block code for each one and have eclipse auto format based on the exception. For example: if my code generates a RemoteConnectionException I'd like to display a dialog to the user to reconnect. If it generates a RemoteContentException I'd like to log it. (I made these up.) Thanks in advance UPDATE: I've been poking around and have two potential solutions. 1) I've found something called the fast code plugin which might do what I'm looking for. http://fast-code.sourceforge.net/index.htm 2) For specifically handling exceptions I'll probably just write a generic exception handler and modify the catch block code to pass the exception to that instead of printing the stack trace. Then the java code will determine which action to take based on exception type.

In most cases, it is possible to catch exceptions in Java, even unchecked ones. But, it is not necessarily possible to do something about it (for example out of memory). For other cases, the issue I am trying to solve is a design principle one. I am trying to set-up a design principle or a set of rules indicating when one should give up on an exceptional situation, even if it is detected in time. The objective is trying to not crash the application as much as possible. Has someone already brainstormed and communicated about this? I am looking for specific generic cases and possible solutions, or thumb-rules. UPDATE Suggestions so far: Stop running if data coherency can be compromised Stop running if data can be deleted Stop running if you can't do anything about it (Out of memory...) Stop running if key service is not available or becomes unavailable and cannot be restarted A method/service should check whether it can perform its duty from a stable state, if not it should inform the user (log) and do nothing If application must be stopped, degrade as gracefully as possible Use rollbacks in db transactions Customized exceptions can be used to give tips about how to solve the situation by handler Log as much relevant information as you can Notify the developers Preserve state and data coherency as much as you can Quick fixes can be harmful, when debugging, better let the application crash and analyze in details what caused it
I know this is a frequently asked question, but i have been searching for a solution for my problem online since yesterday and have not been able to find any! I am using Eclipse Helios with Tomcat 6.0.2, when ever I try to debug my code using the tomcat and eclipse i am getting the error Source not found, this is the case for even the code that i have wrote myself and not just all the jar files I have the java build path set up correctly, I am also using jdk1.6.0 and have this set up correctly as well so that is not the problem, it does show the code when i am debugging if i right click on the debug console and go to Edit Source Lookup.... Because this will show the source code just for that run of the debugger, I when into Run -> Debug Configurations and in the Java Application window i set it up to work with Tomcat and in the source tab I added my project and all the jar files but this does not work either! when i debug again and go into the Edit Source Lookup... it does not show me the project and jar files that I have saved in there Does anybody have any ideas what might be happening?
We are using Hibernate 3.6.0.Final with JPA 2 and Spring 3.0.5 for a large scale enterprise application running on tomcat 7 and MySQL 5.5. Most of the transactions in application, lives for less than a second and update 5-10 entities but in some use cases we need to update more than 10-20K entities in single transaction, which takes few minutes and hence more than 70% of times such transaction fails with StaleObjectStateException because some of those entities got updated by some other transaction. We generally maintain version column in all tables and in case of StaleObjectStateException we generally retry but since these longs transactions are anyways very long so if we keep on retrying then also I am not very sure that we'll be able to escape StaleObjectStateException. Also lot of activities keep updating these entities in busy hours so we cannot go with pessimistic approach because it can potentially halt many activities in system. Please suggest how to fix such long transaction issue because we cannot spawn thousands of independent and small transactions because we cannot afford messed up data in case of some failed & some successful transactions.
This problem is intermittent, occurring every few hours on a process that runs every 30 seconds and performs the following network communication: There is a server on a remote machine listeningThe client connects to this machine and tells the server to connect back to itThe server closes the socket and reconnects to the clientWhen the socket closes on the client side, the client immediately starts listening on the same port The JVM_Bind error happens on the client when it tries to start listening on the same port, even though it only tries to do this after the original socket is closed. Adding a slight delay of 100 milliseconds between the socket closing and opening a new socket prevents the JVM_Bind error. What tools can I use to debug this scenario? Running continuous netstat has not shown anything interfering with the port. Even though it's a kind of bad idea to start a new socket listening on the same port, why would this error occur intermittently? EDIT : Some additional information. The server connects back to the client from an ephemeral port on the server. The Client's old socket would go straight into CLOSED and should be able to be re-opened. Wouldn't the likely cause be something happening on the OS, JVM or hardware?
I was asked in a precedent question to be more precise about my compilation error message. Here's the fact : I know nothing about GWT and Java. Following the docs, I tried to compile Java files from a web project that had been precedently developed using GWT. So, to test and understand how all this work, I took the java folder (that had been precedently compiled with an appropriate tool) into src folder of a web app project in my ide Eclipse When running the compiler using the command GWT Compile, I had this message error : Compiling module java.org.primagora Validating newly compiled units Ignored 5 units with compilation errors in first pass. Compile with -strict or with -logLevel set to TRACE or DEBUG to see all errors. Finding entry point classes [ERROR] Unable to find type 'org.client.primagoraEntryPoint' [ERROR] Hint: Check that the type name 'org.client.primagoraEntryPoint' is really what you meant [ERROR] Hint: Check that your classpath includes all required source roots When I look at the error on the file, for example java.org.client.primagoraEntryPoint, I find an error when it is declared "package org.client" at the very beginning of the file. There seem to be an error path. I thought the java folder I took would be correctly implemented in Eclipse. Is that clearly a file path problem ? How should I debugg it ? (I reallly know nothing about gwt, java , eclipse) Best, Newben

I'm coding in Java, on Android platform, but this isn't really a question for a specific programming language. So ... If an error occurs in my program, i catch it within a try-catch statement and i would like to create an error number which I'll display to the user, giving him the opportunity to send me this error number. The catch is that i would like to code the error in such a way that i get a small number (let's say a maximum of 5 digits) which i later on can decode and can find out exactly in which class, in which method and at which line number the error occured. I'm guessing this is more of a cryptography issue, so has anyone got any ideas on how i should go about doing this? EDIT I was thinking of giving a number to each file, each method and somehow use these values to create the error number, but i'm not sure how to calculate the actual error number so that it will work the other way around (decode it correctly).
I'm working on creating a test suite that runs on multiple databases using dbunit xml. Unfortunately, yesterday I discovered that some table names in our schema are over 30 characters, and are truncated for Oracle. For example, a table named unusually_long_table_name_error in mysql is named unusually_long_table_name_erro in Oracle. This means that my dbunit file contains lines like <unusually_long_table_name_error col1="value1" col2="value2 />. These lines throw a NoSuchTableException when running the tests in Oracle. Is there a programmatic workaround for this? I'd really like to avoid generating special xml files for Oracle. I looked into a custom MetadataHandler but it returns lots of java.sql datatypes that I don't know how to intercept/spoof. I could read the xml myself, truncate each table name to 30 characters, write that out to a temp file or StringBufferInputStream and then use that as input to my DataSetBuilder, but that seems like a whole lot of steps to accomplish very little. Maybe there's some ninja Oracle trick with synonyms or stored procedures or goodness-know-what-else that could help me. Is one of these ideas clearly better than the others? Is there some other approach that would blow me away with its simplicity and elegance? Thanks!
I have been through all the questions on S.O. of the "Eclipse debugger can't find source" variety, but still have no idea what is causing my problem. Basically I have 2 java projects in eclipse, project A and project B, and A is on B's buildpath. A unit test in B instantiates a class ClassX that resides in A. When highlighting the ClassX constructor call in the unit test in B and pressing F3, eclipse does indeed open the ClassX source in A. However as soon as I try and step into this same call in the debugger, I get the "source not found" window. If I click "edit source Lookup path", Then I see that the default path already includes the src folder in project A, where the ClassX source resides. Furthermore if I click the "source" tab in the debug configuration used to debug the unit test in B, the default source lookup path there too contains the src folder in project A. So why can't the debugger find the ClassX source? Any suggestions would be much appreciated! EDIT: The default source path (pictured below) looks like its including project A (org.xtext.example.hyrule ) twice. Is this normal?

We are making an Excel-like system. When we open a document and found unsupported functions we threw exception. We just support small subset of excel functions, this could happen frequently. The problem is when there are a lot of cells that contains unsupported functions, lots and lots of exception instances are created. And creating those many exception instances consumes unignorable amount of time. We don't have any special properties within the exception class. What we need to know is the fact that the exception is thrown. We just found that the error has occurred and mark the cell as error. So we decided to share one exception instance and throw it whenever needed. The exception instance can be thrown by multiple threads. I suspect that the stack trace could be corrupted, however, we don't see it. We just catch the exception, and mark the corresponding cell as error. My question is: In this situation, is it safe to share exception instance? Well, I read the following article: Java: is Exception class thread-safe? But the context seems to be different. Thank you for reading this long question and response in advance.
I would like to provide my system with a way of detecting whether out of memory exception has occurred or not. The aim for this exercise is to expose this flag through JMX and act correspondingly (e.g. by configuring a relevant alert on the monitoring system), as otherwise these errors sit unnoticed for days. Naive approach for this would be to set an uncaught exception handler for every thread and check whether the raised exception is instance of OutOfMemoryError and set a relevant flag. However, this approach isn't realistic for the following reasons: The exception can occur anywhere, including 3rd party libraries. There is nothing I can do to prevent them catching Throwable and keeping it for themselves. Libraries can spawn their own threads and I have no way of enforcing uncaught exception handlers for these threads. One of possible scenarios I see is bytecode manipulation (e.g. attaching some sort of aspect on top of OutOfMemoryError), however I am not sure if that's right approach or whether this is doable in general. We have -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError enabled, but I don't see this as a solution for this problem as it was designed for something else - and it provides no Java callback when this happens. Has anyone done this? How would you solve it or suggest solving it? Any ideas are welcome.
I would like to debug my Java application usually locally, but sometimes on a remote server. I was thinking about rsyncing the class files and the jar dependencies to the remote server (perharps in an ant script) that is run occasionally, and then running the application remotely by ssh and using an ssh tunnel for connecting to the remote JVM. This is easily achieved by running the rsync part as a Builder and the ssh tunnel as an external tool which is ran before debugging sessions. However, I would like to simply launch the remote debug configuration and have it up & running. Ideally, I would like to execute some code snippet before Eclipse tries to connect to the remote JVM, and possibly have its output appear in a Console view. Is there any way of achieving this with some plugins (it is not supported out of the box)? I suppose I could write a quick hack as an Eclipse plugin, but I would prefer not to reinvent the wheel.
I have this site, a random little one i just play around on with jsf and primefaces. I have my own domain connected to it, and hosted it on google-app-engine... It's been working as a charm right up until now. I have not done anything on the site due to vacation time, and suddenly the site is down? It was working when i deployed the last time, now when i go to my site i get this: Error: Server Error The server encountered an error and could not complete your request. If the problem persists, please report your problem and mention this error message and the query that caused it. It tells me absolutely nothing, i've tried to re deploy my app, after checking that it worked fine running locally. The first couple of time it just kept on waiting for a verify.. So i stopped it, which led me to learn how to do a rollback as i could not redeploy with the same version number after i stopped it the first time. I got the rollback fixed, and i now deployed what i know i working code to the app-engine, and still when navigating to my site i get the above error? :S I'm totally clueless here as the error doesn't really give me anything :S Anyone have any ideas, i can post code etc. if necessary but something tells me that it is something else seeing that my code runs locally, and ran fine deployed too :S
When we create a CustomException by extending Exception class it is checked by compiler, but even though RuntimeExceptions extend Exception class are they not checked by the compiler. How is this established in the compiler. I found a section in JLS stating why. Why Runtime Exceptions are Not Checked The runtime exception classes (RuntimeException and its subclasses) are exempted from compile-time checking because, in the judgment of the designers of the Java programming language, having to declare such exceptions would not aid significantly in establishing the correctness of programs. Many of the operations and constructs of the Java programming language can result in runtime exceptions. The information available to a compiler, and the level of analysis the compiler performs, are usually not sufficient to establish that such run-time exceptions cannot occur, even though this may be obvious to the programmer. Requiring such exception classes to be declared would simply be an irritation to programmers. Is there something happens behind the scenes like in the case of marker interfaces. I am looking for some source that can explain how it is done and also why there is no parent class for all checked exceptions?
I'm getting desperate with this Problem: I want to export/run my Android Application with one additional .jar I added to the buildpath.

The consequence of ignoring this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly indicate that it is not an inner class. Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*) when not building a core library. This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your application's project, when using an IDE (such as Eclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's going on. However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality. If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use the "--core-library" option to suppress this error message. If you go ahead and use "--core-library" but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem. If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.

Is there a way to stop a ListIterator from throwing a ConcurrentModificationException? This is what I want to do: Create a LinkedList with a bunch of objects that have a certain method that is to be executed frequently. Have a set number of threads (say N) all of which are responsible for executing the said method of the objects in the LinkedList. For example, if there are k objects in the list, thread n would execute the method of the n-th object in the list, then move on to n+N-th object, then to n+2N-th, etc., until it loops back to the beginning. The problem here lies in the retrieval of these objects. I would obviously be using a ListIterator to do this work. However, I predict this will not get very far, thanks to the ConcurrentModificationException that will be thrown according to the documentation. I want the list to be modifiable, and for the iterators to not care. In fact, it is expected that these objects will create and destroy other objects in the list. I've thought of a few work-arounds: Create and destroy a new iterator to retrieve the object at the given index. However, this is O(n), undesirable. Use an ArrayedList instead; however, this is also undesirable, since deletions are O(n) and there are problems with the list needing to expand (and perhaps contract?) from time to time. Write my own LinkedList class. Don't want to. Thus, my question. Is there a way to stop a ListIterator from throwing a ConcurrentModificationException?
I'm looking for a solution for about 1 1/2 days now and just can't get to the point. I tried to start a *.lnk file in PocketPC 2003 out of our C# application. This *.lnk file contains a link to evm.exe which is a JVM for PocketPC. Argument passed is (besides others) -Xms8M which tells the JVM to reserve at least 8MB of memory. If directly started from Windows Explorer there's no problem. Now I created a process in C# pointing to the *.lnk file. When I try to start it the JVM console opens and brings up one of two errors: "EVM execution history too large" or "failed to initialize heap (Phase 1)" (or something like that). If I delete the mentioned parameter the application comes up with no problem. Because of this behaviour I assume that there is too few memory assigned to the newly created process. Is this realistic? And if: is there a way to assign more memory to the newly created process? Or am I completely wrong and have to go some other way (if any available)? Edit: --CodeSnippet-- this.myStartProcess = new Process { StartInfo = { FileName = appName },EnableRaisingEvents = true }; this.myStartProcess.Start()--CodeSnippet-- Edit 2: After doing some more research it turned out that the real problem is that there are very limited resources available, eaten up by my launcher application (which is about 1.8 MB in total after starting) over time. To improve things I started to study how the garbage collector works in Windows Mobile and so used two techniques to bring up the virtual machine. First one is to reduce the memory taken by my own application by sending it to the background (SendToBack() method of the form) and waiting for the garbage collector to finish (GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()). After that I'm looking for 9 MB of free space in program memory before trying to bring the VM up. If there isn't enough space I try to shift the needed memory from storage memory to program memory. This two techniques improved things a lot! There's still a problem to my launcher application. The allocated bytes (strings and boxed objects to be concrete) increase over time when my launcher application is in front... It's about 30 kb in 10 minutes. After 24 hours the device will be rebooted automatically. At the moment I assume the launcher will be in front for about 10 minutes total during that period. Nevertheless it's not good to have memory leaks. Anyone got an idea how to chase this down? Thanks in advance Best regards Marcel
I have problem using jstl tag <c:if> in jsp file. Basically I should make this as 2 questions although they are related. The first question: In my WEB-INF/lib, I put a jstl 1.2.jar In my jsp file, I put this <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"%>. In my jsp file, I use the <c:if> to do something. If the condition is true, it will shows some special message Basically the contents inside <c:if> is not working, because the message is not shown even the condition is true. But if I changed to use the older namespace, <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/core"%>. Others are not changed, then the if tag is working, because the message inside the if tag is shown. My first question is why I have to use /jstl instead of /jsp/jstl in namespace. I am using jstl1.2.jar. so I am supposed to use the newer uri for 1.2. however, older uri works but not newer uir. The second question: I ignore the first question I have, and just use /jstl as my namespace just because it makes my web app work the way I want. However, when I deploy my web app into tomcat 7.X, it shows exceptions as the following: org.apache.jasper.JasperException: /mywebapp.jsp (line: 35, column: 10) According to TLD or attribute directive in tag file, attribute test does not accept any expressions org.apache.jasper.compiler.DefaultErrorHandler.jspError(DefaultErrorHandler.java:42) in /mywebapp.jsp line:35, column:10, that is < c:if> tag. If I change the namespace from <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/core"%> to <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"%>, it can deploy in tomcat successfully but the functionality inside of < c:if> tag is not useful. other codes outside of <c:if> tag work though. So I am very confused and really want to know how to fix this. By the way, I am using servlet 2.5, jsp 2.0, jstl 1.2. I did try to upgrade the jsp2.0 to jsp2.1 in order to see if I can fix the first problem, but I have no idea how to upgrade jsp version.
From Effective Java "DOCUMENT ALL EXCEPTIONS THROWN BY EACH METHOD" It should be noted that documenting all of the unchecked exceptions that each method can throw is an ideal, not always achievable in the real world. When a class undergoes revision, it is not a violation of source or binary compatibility if an exported method is modified to throw additional unchecked exceptions. Suppose a class invokes a method from another, independently written class. The authors of the former class may carefully document all of the unchecked exceptions that each method throws, but if the latter class is revised to throw additional unchecked exceptions, it is quite likely that the former class (which has not undergone revision) will propagate the new unchecked exceptions even though it does not declare them. I fail to understand how can former class propagate the new unchecked excpetions ? The java language doesn't mandate the caller to catch and propagate unchecked exceptions .
About Me: I'm a newer programmer, and not really sure how Apache-Ant works and what it does Goal: Run the sample programs in the javaconnector jcdb tutorial Platform Background: My machine is OSX 10.5.8 32-bit "which java" gives "/usr/bin/java", which links to "/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.frameworks/Versions/A/Commands/java" "which javac" gives "/usr/bin/javac", which links to "/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.frameworks/Versions/A/Commands/javac" "echo $JAVA_HOME" gives a blank line Java Preferences app in Applications/Utilities lists four versions of Java: 1.6.0_26_b03-385 (64 bit), 1.5.0_30-b03 (32 bit), 1.5.0_30-b03 (64 bit), 1.4.2_22 (32 bit). Currently the 1.6.0 and the two 1.5.0 versions are checked. NOTE: There is no Java 1.6 for 32-bit OSX 10.5.8 What I Did: First I downloaded connector/j unpacked it, moved it to /usr/local/mysql-connector-java, installed it per the README.txt sections 3.1 and 3.2, including modifying CLASSPATH. I already have and use mysql Next, I got the ant binary distribution for version 1.8.4 and installed it according to the manual. Notably, the manual states apache ant works with Java 1.5. "ant -version" returned the correct version, 1.8.4 Then I downloaded the tutorial files, unzipped the file into a directory, and modified the build.xml and properties/mysql-build-properties.xml file per the tutorial's instructions. Finally I complied the package and samples using "ant jar", and created the databases, tables, and populated tables using "ant create-mysql_database". I also ran "ant setup" for good mesure According to to the tutorial, I should now be able to run the samples by putting my shell at the tutorial directory and running "ant <<sample_name>>" . Therefore, I tried to run the sample suggested by the tutorial, "ant runct". In the middle of this procedure, I never changed which Java I was using in the Java Preferences in Applications/Utilities; I did try the procedure using both 1.5.0_30 and 1.6.0_26 as described below My Problem: After running "ant <<sample_name>>" (for example "ant runct"), I get the following error: Buildfile: /Users/adam/Desktop/JDBCTutorial/build.xml runct: [java] Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/oracle/tutorial/jdbc/JDBCTutorialUtilities : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 [java] at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method) [java] at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(ClassLoader.java:631) [java] at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:615) [java] at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:141) [java] at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:283) [java] at java.net.URLClassLoader.access$000(URLClassLoader.java:58) [java] at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:197) [java] at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) [java] at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190) [java] at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306) [java] at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301) [java] at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247) [java] Java Result: 1 BUILD SUCCESSFUL Total time: 1 second My Attempts at Self-Rectification: As far as I can tell from googling, the error has arisen because the files that I downloaded for the tutorial and am attempting to run where compiled with a java other than the one that I am attempting to use to run the files. Therefore, I tried using the 1.6.0 version by putting it at the top of the list in Applications/Utilities/Java_Preferences, and confirming it is being used by using "java -version", and then executing the above procedure. Same error. I also tried re-unzipping the tutorial and modifying the .xml files same as above, but changed the $JAVA and $JAVAC properties in mysql-sample-properties.xml to point at files in /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framwork/Versions/1.5.0/Home/bin, i.e. a version whose number I know, as opposed to files in "/usr/bin", which point to files in /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framwork/Versions/A/Home/bin. I then re-ran "ant jar", "ant create-mysql_database" and "ant setup"; from what I understand this should re-compile the .java files using the compiler I specified(correct?). However, I had the same error when I ran "ant runct" I also tried the following, both with re-setting $JAVA and $JAVAC in mysql-sample-properties.xml to the default (i.e. /usr/bin/java and /usr/bin/javac), and without resetting. I set $JAVA_HOME in my .profile to /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framwork/Versions/1.5.0/Home, tested the correct java is used by running which java which returned the above path and java -version which returned 1.5.0_30, and re-ran "ant jar", "ant create-mysql_database" and "ant setup". When I ran "ant runct" I got the same error. NOTE: The .java files in the tutorial appear to use some objects/syntax added in Java 1.6 A significant problem is I don't know which Java Ant is using. Additional Questions: Why does "usr/bin/java(c)" point to version "A"? What is Java version A??? How do I have a 64-bit java on my 32-bit machine? Is it just emulating a 64-bit machine somehow? If so, does it run slower than 32-bit versions for some tasks? Why do i have a 64-bit 1.5 Java? Which Java complier and Java does ant use? When I change which Java is at the top of the list in Applications/Utilties/Java_Preferences, I can confirm that the machine is using the right default Java by doing "java -version", and can check the path of the Java being used by doing "which java". Regardless of which Java is at the top of the list i.e. being used, "which java" points at "usr/bin/java", which is a shortcut to "/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.frameworks/Versions/A/Commands/java"; this is the same regardless of which version of Java is being used according to Applications/Utilities/Java_Preferences and "java -version"; how is the machine using different versions of Java while pointing to the same directory/file??
I'm trying to create a customize messages.properties file for bean validation messages. I added a Messages.properties file into resource package, and added <application><message-bundle>resources.Messages</message-bundle></application> to my faces-config.xml file. I'm validating an entity which have a primary key field and have the @Id annotation (javax.persistence.Id). when I override messages like javax.faces.converter.BigDecimalConverter.DECIMAL it works greate, but my problem when this input is empty I get the exception message: Can't find bundle for base name resources.Messages, locale en_US. I have also a message for this kind of validation - which is javax.faces.component.UIInput.REQUIRED in the properties file (so it's not that i'm missing the correct message text). so I tried adding into the faces-config.xml file the locale config: <locale-config> <default-locale>en_US</default-locale></locale-config> , and also added another properties file which called: Messages_en_US.properties into the resorce package, but I still get the exception. What could be the problem? am I missing somthing? how can this be resolved? is this problem caused because of the @Id annotation? can I get pass it? I want to be able to see my custom message. I tried every thing I could think of, but didn't get it to work, Please help!! Thank's In Advance.
i have a problem with java swing. i sometimes get this NullPointerException at random times(perhaps at some painting methode?): (the project has over 100 classes, so it makes no sense to post code here, furthermore i am interested on the right approach to find this kind of excp. that is not in my source code) Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NullPointerException at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI$RootView.paint(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI.paintSafely(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI.paint(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI.update(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JComponent.paintComponent(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JComponent.paint(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JComponent.paintToOffscreen(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.RepaintManager$PaintManager.paintDoubleBuffered(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.RepaintManager$PaintManager.paint(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.RepaintManager.paint(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JComponent._paintImmediately(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JComponent.paintImmediately(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.RepaintManager.paintDirtyRegions(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.RepaintManager.paintDirtyRegions(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.RepaintManager.seqPaintDirtyRegions(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.SystemEventQueueUtilities$ComponentWorkRequest.run(Unknown Source) at java.awt.event.InvocationEvent.dispatch(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue.access$000(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.security.AccessControlContext$1.doIntersectionPrivilege(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source) now my question is, how/where should i start to search? i have no idea why this excp. appears. the excp. comes at random times, what makes it difficulter to locate, also. so, has somebody an idea where to start (or it is perhaps a swing problem not caused by myself)?
it's a long time since I used Eclipse Helios, and I found some difficult in changing variable at run time during debug. I have put a breakpoint, and when debugger stops there it shows the object I am looking for in the 'variable' panel, which appears when in debug perspective. The value I am trying to change is a Boolean inside the object, however these are the unsuccessful tentatives I did: Expanded the object, look for variable expanded it until it shows value, changed value to false: this results in changing all the boolean in the object Add watch expression to the boolean variable, but then I wasn't able from there to find a way to change its value don't know if it is relevant, the application I am debugging is running on an old jboss 5.1, and the debug itself is done by running jboss in debug mode, and connect trough eclipse with a debug configuration. All is installed on my localhost. thanks
According to Josh Bloch in Java: There is no way to extend an instantiable class and add a value component while preserving the equals contract, unless you are willing to forgo the benefits of object-oriented abstraction So here 's my case I had a class Foo that had overridden equals() and hashcode() as implemented by Intellij Idea . Now I have another class FooChild that extends Foo and adds a couple more fields to 'Foo`. Now FindBugs is complaining about FooChild: Class doesn't override equals in superclass This class extends a class that defines an equals method and adds fields, but doesn't define an equals method itself. Thus, equality on instances of this class will ignore the identity of the subclass and the added fields. Be sure this is what is intended, and that you don't need to override the equals method. Even if you don't need to override the equals method, consider overriding it anyway to document the fact that the equals method for the subclass just return the result of invoking super.equals(o). My question is "What is meant by equality on instances of this class will ignore the identity of the subclass ? I understand the part about ignoring the added fields since no equals() method has been written for them yet .
I am currently developing a kiosk style Java program to display weather, time, forecast etc. Here is a shot of what the program should look like (screenshot taken before the time updated) The various sections are created as JPanels with the paintComponent() method overridden. They draw in a gradient header and a semitransparent background. However, when I change the content of one of these panels, the previous content is left behind, rather than being removed. An example is shown below: As you can see, when the time changed from 11:51 to 11:52, the numbers overlapped, and the background became lighter (because the semitransparent background was redrawn over it) The Graphical Error What should I do to prevent this overlap? Ultimately, I would prefer to not have to redraw the entire screen when an individual panel updates it's contents. I would prefer to only redraw that particular section. It would be easy to repaint the background, and then all the components within. Update Several answers involve clearing the area to be drawn. Whether I use g.clear() or AlphaComposite.CLEAR it erases the background image. this can be seen in the following image. Perhaps if I could copy the background before I clear the area, I could repaint that section of the background, then layer the other images appropriately. Thoughts? Update 2 An answer was submitted which shows a complete working example of a timer laid over a transparent panel and a background. This is very useful, however, I am not painting my sub-componenets manually. The time, weather icons and temperatures are all JLabels laid out over the semi-transparent panel. I would prefer to not have to paint the individual components manually.
The root of my problem is that I'm trying to use the SizeOf sourceforge project from a web application deployed on JBoss AS7 and getting a ClassNotFoundException for net.sourceforge.sizeof.SizeOf. I added -javaagent:/path_to_jar/SizeOf.jar to the server's JAVA_OPTS and see the System.out.println from the premain method on server startup (JAVAGENT: call premain instrumentation for class SizeOf). However, when I try to call SizeOf.sizeOf(obj) from my servlet's doGet method, the application fails with the aforementioned ClassNotFoundException. If anyone can tell me how to get this working with JBoss AS7, that would be helpful (I have it working in an Eclipse run configuration -- the equivalent of running from the command line). What I would really like to do, above and beyond that, is to understand how classloading works for Java Agents. The best documentation I've been able to find is in the offical JVM docs, and that's pretty sparse. All it says about classloading is that the Premain-Class will be loaded by the system classloader. I saw a blog post that suggested that the jar didn't need to be placed on the classpath, since the -javaagent JVM argument would take care of that, so it would appear that I shouldn't have to add the SizeOf jar as a AS7 module. Am I missing something?
can anyone help. I keep getting an error message in eclipse when creating a new project and i don't understand why. I have created a workspace at the level C:\Users\Martin\Java\Counter Inside Counter there are no files but there is a directory called counter_src which contains source files for the project Counter So in eclipse I do, new java project, and then uncheck default location and choose the directory counter_src (which is one level down from Counter) but it now displays C:\Users\Martin\Java\Counter\counter_src overlaps the location of another project: 'counter_src' Now if i create my workspace at C:\Users\Martin\Java\ which means my counter_src is actually 2 levels down then it allows me, but the problem is that the directory JAVA contains lots of projects so i wanted to create the workspace in Counter (which has no files) which has subdirectory of counter_src where my source files are. Also tested creating directory off of C:\Users\Martin\Java\ and it appears to work also but I didn't want to create another subdirectory off of "C:\Users\Martin\Java\" just to store my workspace for 1 project. I would really appreciate any help on this, i am a little list. Thnaks in advance
Hi hopefully this fulfils the criteria for being a well written question. I'm new to programming and I've been trying to write an application for climbers on android that tells the user what they should be climbing based on their current ability for a training period. The app requires the user to input their climbing ability and the length of their wall. I've set up a preferences menu using SharedPrefences for this with a numeric edit text field and a list. Initially I had an class cast exception as I was trying to use the string from the edit text as a float/double/int (I tried all three!). I've converted the string to a double using Double = Double.valueof(StringFromPrefernce) which solved that error but is now producing the error java.util.FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException: %o does not support ' ' which I've not been able to find a solution for. The app allows the user to access the preference menu initially, however once they have set some values any attempt to access the preference menu will produce this force close. SOLUTION: In my preferences.xml I had referenced a string. That string contained a % symbol which was responsible for the force close. Removing the % symbol fixed the issue.
I am building a simple app monitor to poll one of our API URLs and email us if it can't get a HTTP 200 status code from the response (this would indicate our API is down for some reason). I am using HttpClient 4.1 (this is important because its API differs greatly from 3.x). Our API is secure with SSL, however entering: http://example.com/our-api into a web browser redirects you to https://example.com/our-api Without causing any errors. When HttpClient attempts to hit this URL (http://example.com/our-api), it fails with a javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException exception with a message stating: peer not authenticated I see this happening a lot for other people as is evidenced by this post (which also provides some ways of circumventing this problem - a solution that I am going to try and implement tonight in fact). What this other post (and the other similar ones to it) do not do is explain why this is happening in the first place! So, rather than ask "how do I fix this?" I figured I would ask "why is this happening?" Before I go barging ahead with one of the proposed solutions, I'd like to know what the problem is that I'm attempting to fix ;-)
I'm getting loads of warnings from generated files in my target folder (e.g. Java code generated from XSDs or surefire reports) that I can't fix, and it's hiding proper warnings in my source code. Does anyone know of a way to tell Eclipse not to display warnings in certain folders, or just the "Derived" or target folders? I've only been able to find the following two "almost" solutions: The filter in the "Problems" view allows you to hide warnings containing (or not containing) a specific String in their description, but not part of their path or resource (file). Even if you could, this wouldn't be an ideal solution as the warnings would still be displayed on the project in the package explorer, hiding potential real warnings. With the latest Eclipse version (Juno / 4.2) in the "Java Build Path" settings under the "Source" tab, you can "ignore optional compile problems" from each source folder. But this obviously doesn't work for cases where the folders aren't source folders (like the surefire reports). It does however fix one specific problem with warnings about generated sources, but might not in others, where the sources aren't (can't be) included as source. It would just be nice if there was a way to tell eclipse not to display warnings about things in the target folder altogether, as it's often not very useful and might hide actual problems. Cheers, Svend.
I'm writing an App Engine Java application in Eclipse. So far, it has been just playing with datastore and JDO, the application doesn't do anything serious. However after about an hour of developing I end up with java.lang.OutOfMemoryError error. I've read that this error is most likely caused by some kind of memory leak. For testing I tried to speed up things a little bit and force the error to appear. Using wget I made around 3000 request to the same urls as during the development in Eclipse. But nothing happened. I assume that if there was really a memory leak, I would see it this way... Is it possible hat this error is really caused by the development process? I use the trick with touching appengine-web.xml, so every time I change and save a file the server loads all files again and runs DataNucleus enhancer... so it happens very often, could this be the reason? Another thing is that it probably started after I implemented following solution ( How to use JDO persistence manager?) for working with Persistence Manager. I store the reference to PM in several places during the request but it all should get disposed after the request is finished right? And again, if it was caused by this, wouldn't the error occur after 3000 requests? (Which is way more request than during an hour of development).

I'm working on a physics program and as time goes on I continue to tie up more and more loose ends with exception handling to prevent freezing and locking up. For Now I am getting certain exceptions in my console such as StringFormatException(s), but this error does not freeze the program nor does it affect run-time in any way, it simply shows up in the IDE's terminal (Eclipse IDE, JRE 7). When dealing with errors such as this one, that (seemingly) do not affect run-time, is it still important to handle the exception even if the program works fine? If I were to export the program as a .jar with only these types of errors not handled, would users even notice? Why do some errors cause large problems while others don't? Side Note: I'm asking this primarily because in the future, when taking on projects much larger than this one I believe there are going to be times when a vast number of spots in my code may exist where exceptions are thrown but not yet handled. On very large projects involving tens of thousands of lines of code do many programmers dismiss these types of errors that do not affect logic or run-time and conclude that to go back and fix all of them would not be necessary or worth the time? Or is it essential to develop a habit of committing possible error throwing situations to memory and staying on top of all possible errors. Examples of how software with similar errors to this, ones that allow the program to function as if nothing has happened would be greatly appreciated if you have the source code available and have taken note of this sort of thing.
I don't recall what it is I updated (probably some android ADK items), but suddenly I keep getting a "Problem Occurred" text box in Eclipse, frequently. It says: 'Running Android Lint' has encountered a problem. Failed And there is an OK and a Details button. When I click Details, I get: Failed java.lang.NullPointerException From the text box, I can't tell what it is that failed....it sounds like the running of Lint itself failed, and failed from a NPE. There is no line number associated with any of my code anywhere, so I don't think it's from my code. I've tried disabling running Lint along with everything else...but clicking the checkbox for "Runs Android Lint" just causes Lint to run, and thus give the message box warning. It does seem to actually run, as several Lint warnings appear on the bottom. But it still seems like it's telling me Lint itself is having a NPE...and I have on idea where to fix that. I'm running Eclipse SDK 3.7.2 in Windows Home Premium 64bit, with JDK 6 (recently uninstalled JDK 7 and installed 6 instead.)
I have recently compiled Mozilla JSS (Network Security Services for Java) for my 64bit Mac (OS X 10.6.8) for use in a Java project. The project is being created using Eclipse. I have added the path for the compiled JSS libraries to the Eclipse project by defining the Native Library Path on the Java Build Path. However, I get an UnsatisfiedLinkError on libsmime3.dylib even though it is on the same Native Library Path as defined for libjss4.jnilib. java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /Users//nss-jss/mozilla/dist/Darwin10.8.0_64_OPT.OBJ/lib/libjss4.jnilib: Library not loaded: @executable_path/libsmime3.dylib Referenced from: /Users//nss-jss/mozilla/dist/Darwin10.8.0_64_OPT.OBJ/lib/libjss4.jnilib Reason: image not found After Googling around a bit (and trying several different things), I thought that maybe the dylib extension needed to be jnilib for reasons I don't quite understand for the Mac. I didn't change the makefiles to create a jnilib file instead of a dylib file, but just changed the extension. That didn't work. Since there are many, many dylib files for JSS, I expect that changing the makefiles will take some effort. Before I spent a lot of time attempting the modifications, I thought I would check out SO to see if there was something to help me out. I didn't find anything that solved my issue, hence this post. I would greatly appreciate any advice with JSS in mind as the solutions that I have found for UnsatisfiedLinkError all are for the project in question. Regards, Todd
I am trying to generate the javadoc for my Android app in Eclipse. I've done the following steps: File -> Export -> Java -> Javadoc -> Check project and enter destination, press finish This generates many warnings/errors regarding 'cannot find symbol ...' which is similar to this post Following the solution from that post, I export as an ant script which creates javadoc.xml I then added the path to my android.jar to the classpath field. If I run the script I get one warning which reads: warning: [options] bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 1.5 javadoc: error - Illegal package name: "" The console also says Loading source files for package ...., for each package and then build successful. But the only thing generated is an empty directory doc. After searching for a solution to this I found an article which says the problem comes from having spaces in the class path names. I check my paths and sure enough I have a space in 'Program Files'. I've tried to fixing this by delimiting the space several ways but I can't get it to work. Just to see what happens I deleted the offending line from the class path and the same error occurs..so that leads me to believe the error may lay elsewhere. Any ideas? UPDATE I found a discussion here that pointed me to checking my CLASSPATH environment variable. I had a duplicate value.. '.;' and '%CLASSPATH%.;' I removed the latter and the error went away. I'm still left with the warning noted above, "bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 1.5". It's not causing any problems that I can notice, but if anyone knows a way to fix it that would be great
I'm debugging a fairly large project I've been working on (but did not originally create) and I've noticed that sometimes it crashes with an OutOfMemoryError. The code is loading a lot of data from files so this isn't entirely surprising in general. However, what confuses me is that I'm using VisualVM 1.3.4 to profile the program, and it behaves inconsistently. Most times I've run it, the heap gradually expands up to about 2GB (the computer has 16GB of RAM; it's for academic research) with the used heap spiking higher and higher underneath it. Around 2GB, it will crash. The program isn't proccessing more information as time goes on though, so it shouldn't grow the heap to 2GB in just a few minutes. Sometimes, though, I get a sudden crash after about 30 seconds, with a heap size of 250MB and only about 100MB in use. How am I getting a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space if my heap isn't full? Edit: I'm using Eclipse to run the program, and I have the VisualVM plugin so it gets launched automatically. Also, I'm using Java 7.
I'm working on a prototype MoSync / MAUI application: it runs fine in my Android phone and in the emulators (MoRe / JavaME). Then I try to compile and run the program in a couple of old Java phones (Motorola V3i and LG KP500) but I cannot manage to make it work, so I tested the phones with the MoSync HelloMAUI example: On the LG (tested with several LG profiles) HelloMAUI runs but display only a blank screen (I saw some MoSync forum entries on LG phones about having poor or incompatible JavaME support) On the Motorola v3i (compiled with the V3I profile) HelloMAUI stops with an "Application Error" I'm a little disappointed on that, because the selling point I saw on MoSync was the support to this kind of old mobile phones. I'm developing an application to collect data, and this kind of old phones are cheaper and more rugged than recent Android phones, then I was trying to have a single codebase to all the devices: Did any of you had a good experience compiling and running an MoSync->JavaME application for this kind of old mobile phones? (not on the JavaME emulator, that works fine) If so, can you post what phone brand and model that worked fine in your particular case? I have no previous experience compiling Java ME applications, and saw several complains in the MoSync forum about incompatibilities among the Java implementations of several mobile devices that threatens the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" mantra. Is that the case? Maybe I'm naive but expected that a JAR/JAD that ran fine on the J2ME emulator can be deployed without major concerns over different phones.
I modified the init script of tomcat(catalina.sh)——set the JAVA_OPTS as below : JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms8g -Xmx8g -Xmn3g -Xss128K -Dj ava.awt.headless=true".

I am trying to write my first SOA client, and am having difficulties with the "2-way SSL" part. Our server runs under Weblogic, but my application is a simple Java Console app - it does not run in any container. The server uses and requires certificates. We use trusted certificates from Godaddy.com, and we also have internal certificates. Our sysadm gave me the server certificates, which I added to my JRE "cacerts" file using keytool. I was told that I should use Spring-WS as it would make my life easier, but I am having trouble getting it to work, as there are quite a few variations that Chap. 7 mentions, and I am not sure which one I should be using. He also created a .jks file for me personally to use for my authorization. I would prefer to not use Spring at all, for this simple application (the SOA method is a simple "Add comment" method with no substantive return data. I am working with MyEclipse 9.1 and am trying to use Maven4MyEclipse as well. My question is: Given that my authentication certs will be available via the JRE cacerts file (if I understand this correctly), the main thing I need to do is to be able to present my .jks file during the SSL handshake. Can I do this without Spring? If so, is there a way I can simply set a System property with my .jks file so it gets handled automatically? Or do I really need to use Spring to handle the authorization part? If the latter, how do I know which Spring security interceptor type to use? XwsSecurityInterceptor or Wss4jSecurityInterceptor? Or another question just occurred to me. Can the .jks file also be added to the cacerts file and have the authorization handled automatically? Thanks, Mitch p.s. Believe it or not, there is apparently no existing Java client example in my organization to simply look at for a template.
Is it possible to figure out all possible exceptions that can be thrown that are not necessarily listed by the method's signature. There are 2 cases 1) runtime exceptions that don't have to be declared (obviously some are obvious, such as null pointer, but there are other runtime exceptions that I'd want to catch that can be due to bad data, which while in development I don't know is bad data yet). 2) exceptions that are subclasses of the exception listed in the signature. a motivation example imagine I call getInputStream() on an HttpURLConnection object, it throws java.io.Exception, but in reality, it throws other exceptions that are sublcasses of java.io.Exception (ala java.io.FileNotFoundException), which I'd want to handle in a unique manner (i.e. don't want to lump all java.io.Exceptions together). so while I can learn in practice by catching java.io.Exception and printing out the actual exception, and then modifying code to handle that case, was wondering if there was a better method :) thanks edit: I think people are missing my 2nd problem. Methods that throw checked exceptions that are fully consistent with the method's signature, but aren't listed in it due to the method's signature only having some sort of base class.
We have an issue with SSL and I am 99% this is not your usual certificates trust store merry-go-round. We have a Weblogic server trying to make SSL connections to Active Directory via LDAPS, underlying SSL implementation is the JSSE. Some of the time, it works. Usually for a few hours after restarting Weblogic. After which we start getting SSL Handshake errors, with SSL debug turned on we see: [ACTIVE] ExecuteThread: '10' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)', handling exception: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset [ACTIVE] ExecuteThread: '10' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)', SEND TLSv1 ALERT: fatal, description = unexpected_message [ACTIVE] ExecuteThread: '10' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)', WRITE: TLSv1 Alert, length = 32 [ACTIVE] ExecuteThread: '10' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)', Exception sending alert: java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe So far I have tried the following to understand/replicate it: Connecting via OpenSSL with the certs loaded - works OK every time Connecting via secure ldapsearch with the certs loaded - works OK every time Connecting via a custom test Java client - works OK every time Decrypting the SSL handshake with Wireshark and the private key. What I noticed with Wireshark for the "bad" hand shake, is that after the client sends a Change Cipher Spec, Finished message AD does not reply in kind. More so, Wireshark cannot decrypt the SSL handshake, failing with: ssl_decrypt_pre_master_secret wrong pre_master_secret length (109, expected 48) dissect_ssl3_handshake can't decrypt pre master secret Note Wireshark SSL decryption works perfectly when the SSL handshake works perfectly. I can't see any significant differences in the good and bad SSL handshakes, until the point where the AD server does not respond. At this point I'm stumped... I'm really struggling to understand why this would fail for some of the time and work the rest, at this point I am really just hoping for some suggestions as to what might be going on. Oh yes, almost forgot. There is an error in the Active Directory Event log: Event ID: 36888 The following fatal alert was raised: 20. The state of the internal error is 960. Which, after a bit of research I managed to discover corresponds to an SSL "BAD_RECORD_MAC" error. The only theory I have at this point, is that for some reason the wrong public key is being used to encrypt the handshake... I can't see otherwise why the server (and Wireshark) would fail to decrypt the finished message. Thanks! Updates: I've compared the bad and good cases, the cipher spec in both cases is the same: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA. I have also compared the packets from both the client and server side, barring the normal Ethernet and IP protocol differences they are all seemingly identical.
We have configure a Big F5 load balancer virtual server for a particular IP address which redirects incoming https requests to several Windows servers where there is functionality to generate responses. I am using SoapUI to test access to these windows servers via the IP address of virtual server in the Big F5. Using Server and Client certificates generated by the organization where the we have also this set up and sending requests via SoapUI I get the predicted responses back. The business requirements call for Commercially signed certificates by Thawte. We created a Certifcate Servcice Request (CSR) to generate a Server certificate and its private key and then we had it signed by Thawte, and also requested a Client Commercially signed certificate from Thawte. We loaded both certificates in SoapUI client and the Big F5 load balancer but we attempting to test the requests we get the "javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake" error. My questions are: How can I monitor where exactly the 2 way SSL handshake is terminated The actual reason what exactly is happening?.. why using commercially signed certificates this does not work now? Any replies are welcome. Thanks. However when we swithch Serverto commercially signed by Thawte

I used this sample code in a similar clock application: http://about-android.blogspot.in/2010/04/create-apps-to-show-digital-time-in_19.html It works fine, however when using the back or home buttons I get a nullpointerexception in the log. It says unable to stop application. If I remove the methods : timer.cancel(); timer.purge(); timer = null; It works OK, but I suppose this would be memory consuming? /M 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): FATAL EXCEPTION: main 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to stop activity {se.macke.binarycounter/se.macke.binarycounter.MainActivity}: java.lang.NullPointerException 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.app.ActivityThread.performDestroyActivity(ActivityThread.java:2624) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.app.ActivityThread.handleDestroyActivity(ActivityThread.java:2690) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.app.ActivityThread.access$2100(ActivityThread.java:117) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:964) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:123) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:3683) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:507) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:839) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:597) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at se.macke.binarycounter.MainActivity.onStop(MainActivity.java:209) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnStop(Instrumentation.java:1170) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.app.Activity.performStop(Activity.java:3873) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): at android.app.ActivityThread.performDestroyActivity(ActivityThread.java:2619) 08-19 19:00:13.438: E/AndroidRuntime(1064): ... 11 more 08-19 19:00:16.398: I/Process(1064): Sending signal.

I have a common problem where I would like to hear your opinion on what's the best way to do it. Assume you have an application that runs on a distributed server system. Let's say frontend and backend server. Methods on the backend server a called through RMI. The backend java process usually needs different libraries than the frontend java process. It's possible that a runtime exception occurs in the backend. The thrown exception is not caught by the backend and so it travels to the frontend server. The problem now is that the frontend doesn't know the exception because the package isn't in the classpath (e.g. EJBTransactionRolledBackException). Another exception is thrown - ClassNotFoundException. This makes it impossible to see where the execption occured because the stacktrace doesn't include the stack from the backend server. Another scenario I can think of is where the exception cannot be serialized. How do you solve this problem? Can I somehow log any runtime exception that is thrown without having to build a try ... catch and rethrow block?
Hi Java web service experts, I am working on a web service project. My goal is to create a client java program to consume the vendor web service and deliver a data file. I am at the part where I am able to generate the proxy classes from the vendor wsdl document through JDeveloper. Now I start to work to create the java stand alone client application. My issue is I am not able to debug or run my java program because of this following error. I think it has to do with the imported vendor.xml document in Jdeveloper but I am not sure. Below is the error The target vendor.xml cannot be started because it is not a runnable target. The target run cannot be started because it does not exist. I've researched into this issue but not much information came up after all. I am new to this web service and would appreciated all the help.
I am researching server side development of Apple Push Notifications in Java. I am using the enhanced format, in order to detect failed messages and resend messages that follow bad messages. I know that Apple to not guarantee the delivery of Push Notifications, but I wish to be able to know whether Apple received my messages and whether the contained any errors. I noticed that when I try to send an invalid message (invalid device token, too large payload, etc...) to Apple, I can send several more messages before the socket is closed. When the socket is closed it's too late to read the error codes from Apple, so I have no idea which message was the bad one (or even if there was a bad message, since Apple say the connection may close occasionally even when there is no error). The approach I've seen in the source of JavaPNs to handle this is to read responses from Apple immediately after each message (or group of messages) are sent. The reading from the socket if performed frequently, and waits for a timeout in case there is nothing to read. This is acceptable if you send push notifications infrequently. If you try to send a large number of notifications in a high frequency (lets say hundreds per second), you can't stop after each message to wait for responses from Apple (even if you wait for a response only for 20ms, that would limit you to 50 messages per second, and you have no way of knowing how long it would take Apple to write the error response, so a short wait may not be enough). If you don't stop to read possible errors after each message, you risk your connection being closed during the sending of messages to Apple, in which case you won't be able to get the Id of the message that caused the connection to close. Another approach I'm considering is to perform the reads and the writes in separate threads. This way I have a much better chance of getting the error messages from Apple (before the connection is closed) without compromising the speed in which I send messages to Apple. This approach is more complicated programmatically, and since my server is expected to send APNs to multiple iOS applications, each requiring its own socket and reader/writer threads, this will increase the number of threads I need by a factor of two. All of the above described behavior of the APN Server was learned while attempting to send push notifications to Apple's sandbox server. I'm not sure if the behavior of Apple's production server is better, and I'm not sure it's a good idea to perform my tests on the production server. My question - Is there a way to reliably read the error responses from Alpha before they close the connection, without sacrificing performance? Is it possible somehow to read input from the socket after it was closed by the server?
I have a Java console app that iterates over a list of names and account numbers, and is going to do two things, which I call part A and part B. Part A is to use the FedEx public SOA interface to create a shipping label. This was the first part of the program I wrote, and it works fine. Part B is using our internal SOA interface to write the FedEx tracking number to the customer's account. The interface for this is basically AddComment(String acctNum, String comment) I wrote a stand-alone Java app to test part B, and it works fine. When I added part B into the original program, part A still works, but I get an SSL handshake error when I try to execute part B. The SOA interface for part B is using SSL. I even put in a flag so that I can run the program as "part A only" or "part B only", and again, each one works individually, but when run together part B fails. It smells like a case where something under the hood is being left in by part A such that part B no longer is working the way it did before. It seems like this might be a not-uncommon problem when you have two different servers, both of which might have different protocols, etc. So my real question is more general, and not just a coding issue. Is there a way for me to reset my environment in my code, just before starting part B, so that it runs the way it does running stand-alone?
I'm trying to do something which seems like it should be pretty straightforward to me, but doesn't seem to be working... I have a page composed of tiles and at the moment there is an exception in the render phase of one of the jsps, causing my error page to be shown - but this is only shown in the tile in which it occurs. What I would really like is the whole page to show the error, not just one of the tiles, surely this is possible? The error page shown is defined in the web.xml and contains <%@ page isErrorPage="true" %> and I have also tried adding <%@ page errorPage="/errorPage.jsp" %> to my baselayout.jsp but this doesn't seem to be recognised - I can put in any value and it doesn't give an error or anything. Does tiles not have an option to propagate the exception up to the parent jsp rather than just displaying the error in each tile? SimpleMappingExceptionResolver for example won't work, as the exception is in the render phase. I have tried implementing a HandlerInterceptor as recommended in Spring SimpleMappingExceptionResolver not going to default view however in the afterResourceCompletion() method the exception parameter is null, which is where I thought my exception would be. I have also had a look at http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=1071592 which seems to indicate that there's an issue with the older version of Struts - does Spring share this issue? Hopefully I'm missing something very simple here, any help is very much appreciated!

In HashSet.java in JDK 1.6, there are some comments about the fail-fast property of HashSet's iterator. The iterators returned by this class's iterator method are fail-fast: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove method, the Iterator throws a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future. I can understand the above paragraph because It's pretty simple and clear, but I cannot understand the following paragraph. I may understand it if I have some simple examples showing that a fail-fast iterator can even fail. Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs.
Is it possible in Eclipse debugging/running a Java application to direct standard output to a file that has a generated timestamp in the name ? Currently, I send the output to a text file (ex. server.log), then it either gets overwritten or appended (if i have the checkbox set). However, I would like to know if there's a way to include a timestamp in the configuration so that the log files are created each time with a generated name with current time in milliseconds ... e.g. server_1346105152004.log ?? I'd like to keep each log, and every time I restart create a new log with a different name. Has anyone done this ? Please note: I'm not looking for a logging framework that accomplishes this task, I'm currently using multiple frameworks on different applications that accomplish this. I'm simply wondering if this is possible within the Eclipse Run/Debug menus.
A seemingly straightforward problem: I have a java.util.concurrent.Semaphore, and I want to acquire a permit using acquire(). The acquire() method is specified to throw InterruptedException if the thread is interrupted: If the current thread: has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or is interrupted while waiting for a permit, then InterruptedException is thrown and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared. However, the usual pattern with methods that may throw InterruptedException is to call them in a loop, since threads can be subject to spurious wakeups that look the same as being interrupted. For example, the documentation for Object.wait(long) says: A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a so-called spurious wakeup. While this will rarely occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied. In other words, waits should always occur in loops. So the question is, is Semaphore.acquire() subject to the same kind of spurious wakeup? The logical answer would be "no", but I can't find any evidence for that, and in fact the evidence seems to point in the other direction. Looking at the source for Semaphore, it appears that it delegates the actual acquire to an AbstractQueuedSynchronizer, which according to its source delegates to LockSupport.park(). The documentation for LockSupport.park() explicitly mentions spurious wakeup, but the implementation of AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.doAcquireInterruptably() appears to just check Thread.interrupted() and then throw InterruptedException. So, unless I'm missing something (which is very possible), it appears that Semaphore.acquire() can throw InterruptedException spuriously? Is that correct? More importantly, is there anything I can do about that? I could use Semaphore.acquireUninterruptably(), but I don't want an uninterruptable wait, just one that doesn't get interrupted spuriously. Is there any alternative?
I'm using 2 Vaadin Portlets on the same page in Liferay. The first one shows a Table of entries and each row has a button to show details about this entry. When the button is clicked an IPC event is send which is received by the second portlet, which then switches also to a table view showing the content. By clicking a close button on the first portlet, the second one will receive again an IPC Event and go back to its original state, which is a blank view that has only the Liferay IPC listener attached to it. My problem is that after the third click I get an out-of-sync error by Liferay. When the view is changed I always attach it to the main window. So I don't create additional windows that have the same name. When I use only one portlet on the page I can switch back and forth without any problem. Could it be that the at some point the browser want to fire an event on the client side, but the IPC is already gone on the server side ? Its really hard to determine the root of this problem.
I know there are many problems like this, but I've followed a bunch of the various solutions with no success. I am running Eclipse 3.7 on Mac OSX 10.6.8. I have previously worked on Android applications on this SDK and gotten them to compile. But, on my latest project (I had gotten it to compile and run using the Android virtual device when it was in an extremely basic state), when I tell it to Run (to test it out on the virtual device) I get this error message (even though there are no little red X's or anything anywhere in my project or other detectable errors): [2012-09-01 18:13:48 - RadarGun] Dx trouble processing "java/andythompson/radargun/BuildConfig.class": Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*) when not building a core library. This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your application's project, when using an IDE (such as Eclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's going on. However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality. If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use the "--core-library" option to suppress this error message. If you go ahead and use "--core-library" but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem. If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.

I have an Apache Tomcat + Hibernate based application. I have a class MyModel and a class MyViewModel which decorates an object of type MyModel. When I get a request I return several instances of MyViewModel in the Map. Lets say an instance is x. When i try to access ${x.comments}, I get a property not found exception. I have double checked that MyModel contains a getComments() and setComments() method. Also MyViewModel contains getComments() method which invokes getComments() on the decorated object, returns empty string if null is returned. Now the surprising part is that this code was working yesterday when I added the comments field everywhere in my code. My database still has the comments field. But somehow the bean is not being identified properly. I have made some changes to the code and now I am using jquery-ui to get to the page but I don't see how that should make a difference as I can access all other fields except the comments field. The Hibernate logs show that the select query is not fetching the comments field. I tried restarting the server, my Eclipse IDE nothing seems to work. Can you please help me identify the problem? Thanks in Advance!
I am working on a server client project where server is a Gateway which resides in the field and where we are developing the client. The client is scheduled to connect the server and get the data. Now my problem is the server has idle timeout for 10 secs. If the server and client are idle for 10 secs the server disconnects the client automatically. How can I catch the timeout exception in client where there is no chance of server sending any message to client as time out occurred so it is closing the connection. if the server closes the client connection due to some network failure the client gets Connection refused exception. Similarly I want for idle timeout connection. Please help me in solving this issue. Thanks in advance.
I have a Java project that essentially is made up of three main parts: A web server application using the Google App Engine -> war ( fs_primeranks_server ) A client application for the desktop -> JAR (fs_proxy) An Android app that connects to the web server. (fs_replay) A bonus module containing common jar class library containing the common data object representation. (fs_data) I started out with creating the project in InteliJ IDEA. I got to the current point and then made the change to maven. However, making the change the server component is no longer running. It compiles, but throws a Class Not Found exception. As previously with the InteliJ IDEA project files everything was running fine I am quite sure my problems are with how my maven files are set up. Nevertheless, after hours of research and looking I'm still unable to correct it. So any ideas? The project files hosted on github.. The output of the Maven build process, plus the gae:run command (with the exception). (the warning starts like: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: net.primeranks.fs_server.GuiceConfigFsPrimeranksServer) Image of the file structure after build. Jar files and class files seem okay. Thanks!

We are in the process of upgrading from JBoss 6 to JBoss 7. The nature of our application has a separate database instance per customer, as well as a core configuration database common to all customers. We often have EJB code which will at least reference the core database plus the individual customer's data in one call, and even some general background processes that go through all customers. In JBoss 6 this was handled without issue by setting the method with a NOT_SUPPORTED transaction attribute. However, JBoss 7 complains about this with the following error: ARJUNA012140: Adding multiple last resources is disallowed. Trying to add LastResourceRecord(XAOnePhaseResource(LocalXAResourceImpl@74bec54d[connectionListener=d3ce980 connectionManager=25b47a05 warned=false currentXid=< formatId=131077, gtrid_length=29, bqual_length=36, tx_uid=0:ffff0a2c28d1:-5a4c1f9a:504689c9:11, node_name=1, branch_uid=0:ffff0a2c28d1:-5a4c1f9a:504689c9:14, subordinatenodename=null, eis_name=unknown eis name >])), but already have LastResourceRecord(XAOnePhaseResource(LocalXAResourceImpl@518d0191[connectionListener=1a05d94a connectionManager=135f1cfe warned=false currentXid=< formatId=131077, gtrid_length=29, bqual_length=36, tx_uid=0:ffff0a2c28d1:-5a4c1f9a:504689c9:11, node_name=1, branch_uid=0:ffff0a2c28d1:-5a4c1f9a:504689c9:13, subordinatenodename=null, eis_name=unknown eis name >])) How can we work around this problem without wrapping every call to the different databases in a separate EJB call and transaction. Is there a way to actually turn off the JBoss transaction management in an EJB call or something similar? Note: This question was modified after the bounty started based on additional discovery to sharpen the focus on the specific problem and remove other possibilities that were excluded.
I need some advice about this... I have a program that serves as a utility for another system. My program's function is to monitor the database and locate certain entries with a specific value; This value is produced when the main system encounters a specific condition wherein it cannot process the entry further. When the specific value is located, my program will validate if the requirements needed to process it is available, and call the method where the system stopped it's processing so that it could complete the entry. My program encounters an error every time it tries to call the method of the main system. The command prompt shows this error "Exception in thread "timer-0" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError" bear in mind that the main program is continuously running. It gets another entry every time an entry is finished. So it is possible that my program could be calling a method which is currently in use by the main system. I'm not sure if the error is due to my program, not locating the method needed as for the NoClassDefFoundError or if my program is trying to call the method which is currently in use by the main program as per the Exception in thread "timer-0". Also the main and my program is not using any threads.

Everything seems to work fine, once i put online my report and i enter some input in the parameters and then it submits the form with almost any report format: text/html, pdf and cvs. But when I try to submit an excel output (application/vnd.ms-excel) I get the following error: The Pentaho BI Platform reported an error while running an action sequence Possible Causes: RuntimeContext.ERROR_0017 - [es_18] Activity failed to execute Action Sequence:BillingReport.xaction Execution Stack: EXECUTING ACTION: Pentaho Report (SimpleReportingComponent) Loop Index (1-based):0 Error Time:miércoles 5 de septiembre de 2012 12H18' VET Error Type:ActionExecutionException Session ID:joe Instance Id:65ad1224-f779-11e1-a34f-b53c1ce91064 Action Class:SimpleReportingComponent Action Description:Pentaho Report Even with no fields in the .prpt file it keeps showing that same error (i also refreshed biserver using administration console with every change i make). If I check what happened in catalina.out log I get a bunch of java exception traces but there's a line that shows: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The maximum column width for an individual cell is 255 characters. I'm not sure but it seems like a jira issue related with apache/tomcat function called setColumnWidth. Any Ideas?
I have seen sudden spike in my application / platform memory utilization.In the GC verbose logs I have seen below : 1285.946: [GC 1285.946: [ParNew (promotion failed): 353920K->353920K(353920K), 0.8003983 secs]1286.747: [CMS1287.338: [CMS-con current-sweep: 7.902/9.624 secs] [Times: user=96.62 sys=2.35, real=9.62 secs] (concurrent mode failure): 2531317K->1161025K(2752512K), 24.8330303 secs] 2860005K->1161025K(3106432K), [CMS Perm : 37117K->3 6905K(62368K)], 25.6341706 secs] [Times: user=26.41 sys=0.05, real=25.63 secs] [ POA RootPOA - rid: 17 oid: 00 17 2E 29 23 33 49 34 25 3E opname: ping - process request ] 1312.367: [GC 1312.367: [ParNew: 314624K->30240K(353920K), 0.0188874 secs] 1475649K->1191266K(3106432K), 0.0194380 secs] [Time s: user=0.40 sys=0.00, real=0.02 secs] 1313.249: [GC 1313.249: [ParNew: 344864K->39296K(353920K), 0.0300220 secs] 1505890K->1201198K(3106432K), 0.0305488 secs] ParNew (promotion failed ),concurrent mode failure : Please explain and How to resolve this.I believe the sudden spike in the memory is visible because of GC failure.

1) Is it possible to track the number of exceptions being thrown by application? Can I write a test that will print me such a number? Uncaught exceptions stops the execution, so its easy, but what about caught exceptions? 2) How do I write a test that will tell me the number of activities completed in a second? For example, average number exceptions thrown by code in a second, average number of entities saved per second, average number of users logged to the site per second etc. For example, I want to put some load on my webapp and find out how many entities it can save per second under such a load, where the limit etc 3) I want to know how many times some line is executed. Can I do it without changing the code? 4) I want to see the value of expression during the execution of the code without changing the code (*) 5) I want to stop the execution of my application not in the breakpoint, but only if some expression or variable is equal to some value (for example, stop app if this variable is null). Without changing the code, of course. (*) probably I can use Watches for this. Idea debugger has this feature and I can see the value of some expression during the execution. But when the execution reaches that line second time an old value is cleared. How can I look at expression value in a dynamical way?

I'm developing a GWT app that will be deployed to GAE. I have installed the Google-Eclipse plugin which also pulled down the GWT and GAE SDKs. But now that I am sitting down and actually thinking about things, I've become very confused as to how to both debug and run apps locally on my machine. Normally, when I have a Java web app (I deploy to Tomcat; I'm just familiar with it), my options are as follows: Create a remote Debug Configuration for my app, deploy the WAR to my local Tomcat container, but in such a way that I can debug it (set breakpoints, step through server-side code) right from inside Eclipse Just deploy it to the Tomcat container, fire up a browser at http://localhost:8080/MyApp and start using/manually-testing the app locally I want to accomplish the same, but with GWT and GAE there are so many options for both, and they become exponentially more confusing (to a newcomer such as myself) when you pair them together on the same machine: Ultimately, I'd like to be able to do the following: Debug the server app, including setting breakpoints, stepping through code, etc., right from inside Eclipse Debug the client app, including setting breakpoints, stepping through code, etc., from inside a browser plugin like Firebug or Chrome Developer Tools, locally on my machine Debug the app (both client- and server-side code in tandem), including setting breakpoints, stepping through code, etc., right from inside Eclipse Same as above (debug the entire app, client- and server-side), from inside Eclipse, but where the server is running on a different (remote) machine. This way I can debug my app as it is running on my QA machine/environment, right from inside the Eclipse instance on my development machine Run the app locally and simulate production; that is, deploy the backend to my GAE app dev server, and then open up a browser and go to the correct URL for accessing my app as it is served up by the local GAE dev appserver I think the root of my confusion stems from the fact that both GWT and GAE SDKs run in so-called "dev modes", and because they address different tiers (client and server) its tough to wrap my head around what setup/configs are necessary to be able to isolate them if needed, or test them in tandem if needed. Thanks in advance for any help here!
I think Eclipse is trying to make me miserable. A couple of hours ago, my project was working and compiling well. Suddenly that all changed. Eclipse somehow wipes out all changes I have made to my files(activity, manifest etc.) I make sure to save often but when I go to run the project, I get the error that I have a build error. I checked and there was none, so I go to close Eclipse, so I can reopen and see if the errors will go away. Instead what happens is Eclipse wipes clean all my files and I end up with a project on disk with lots of blank code files. I try to run anyway, and I get the error message below. Failed to read the project description file (.project) for 'com.example.android.nfc.simulator.FakeTagsActivity.FakeTagsActivity'. The file has been changed on disk, and it now contains invalid information. The project will not function properly until the description file is restored to a valid state. Anyone have an idea what in the world this is about and how I can rectify this?
This seems to be a problem with the on-the-fly code parser. As I am typing something, eclipse (latest release version) might update to reflect that I have an error. But when I finish typing the line, the error will still remain in the Problems tab and never get fixed, no matter what changes I make to that file or any other file. The only way to fix this problem is to go to Project->Clean... which of course works every time. I use a rapid prototyping technique where I need to test my project hundreds of times throughout a day. This error happens about 10% of the time I want to run or debug a project, which is 10 times every day. Cleaning my project takes a significant number of seconds since we have hundreds of resources that need to be re-parsed. This is very frustrating and is killing my productivity. Is there any fix or patch to eclipse to fix this problem? If not, does anyone know of a workaround?

For a university project we need to make a game in a group of 5 people in Java. As we are writing a game in 3D first person I want to use lwjgl. I wrote up a test program on my home computer which is running Ubuntu. However I brought it to uni and tried to run it on the machines there which are Arch Linux and it threw an exception when trying to call the Display.create() method. Here is the stack trace: failed to create drawable org.lwjgl.LWJGLException: X Error - disp: 0x7bde17a0 serial: 89 error: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) request_code: 14 minor_code: 0 at org.lwjgl.opengl.LinuxDisplay.globalErrorHandler(LinuxDisplay.java:318) at org.lwjgl.opengl.LinuxContextImplementation.nMakeCurrent(Native Method) at org.lwjgl.opengl.LinuxContextImplementation.makeCurrent(LinuxContextImplementation.java:121) at org.lwjgl.opengl.ContextGL.makeCurrent(ContextGL.java:194) at org.lwjgl.opengl.DrawableGL.makeCurrent(DrawableGL.java:110) at org.lwjgl.opengl.Display.makeCurrent(Display.java:703) at org.lwjgl.opengl.Display.makeCurrentAndSetSwapInterval(Display.java:1022) at org.lwjgl.opengl.Display.create(Display.java:849) at org.lwjgl.opengl.Display.create(Display.java:754) at org.lwjgl.opengl.Display.create(Display.java:736) I've asked around uni but no one seems to be any help as no one has used lwjgl. I can't update the graphics card drivers because it is a university machine. I also have to have it running on the uni machine as we have to present our project on it and other people in the group will be programming on them. Does anyone know how to fix this? Or is there an alternative library that can I use that uses openGL? I know there is java opengl but it doesn't seem as nice as lwjgl.
I have a Linux Ubuntu 12.04 box that I use for development. I downloaded and uncompressed Tomcat 7.0.28 and put the xcmis.war that is in the xCMIS 1.2.2 distribution (the 'server' one, from the xCMIS Google Code page) in the webapps/ folder. I started up Tomcat and pointed my browser to the xCMIS web app. I got the page of the xCMIS instance without any problem. Then I started CMIS Workbench and pointed to the address labeled as REST Atom Services in the front page of my xCMIS instance (http://localhost:8080/xcmis/rest/cmisatom) Using the credentials provided (root / exo) I tried to connect. A small pop-up window appeared, saying 'runtime: Unauthorized'. But when I tried the same using the Tomcat 6 bundle from the xCMIS page, it worked, i was able to connect, select a repository, and create folders and documents. But what I want is to take an ordinary Tomcat 7 and make it capable of serving a xCMIS repository without problems. Any hints? Thanks in advance, - Sam Update: I solved it by realizing that the reason for the Unauthorized error was an HTTP authorization error. Adding the same users that the example xCMIS Tomcat server had in its conf/tomcat-users.xml solved the problems.
I have a form (form.jsp) and a connected FormAction ActionA. ActionA does validations and stores ActionErrors and the form.jsp will print them using <html:errors../> tag. All this is working fine. I then wanted to add some on-the-fly server side validation on onblur event on one of the form fields (fieldA). I do this using jQuery's $.post. It goes to a different Action class (ActionB) which will return a value, that I can print in a div under fieldA. This also works fine. The problem is to combine the two. I use saveErrors method in ActionA and need to reset it with the new errors I get in ActionB. Example: If fieldA was value "A" and fieldB was "#$" and my ActionA returned errors "No capitals for fieldA" and "No symbols for fieldB" on pressing Submit, then when user changes fieldA to "123" and presses tab, the errors shown should be "No numbers for fieldA" and "No symbols for fieldB" i.e. first error gets removed. But how do I access the errors, if it isn't in the request!
I know how to create a JAR file with the source code with maven, and also create an executable JAR. But my question is if there is any way of creating an executable JAR (so it contains all the .class files) that also contains the source code (so for each .class its corresponding .java file). I want this for debugging with eclipse since my maven project is a library for another project and when debugging the bigger project I loose track when the execution reaches my library because the source code is missing in the JAR. I've found a solution among this forums that suggests to create two jars, one executable and another with .java files and set the source path in the IDE to point to the code JAR, but I would like to work with a unique JAR instead of two. Is that possible? if not with maven with another java tool? For instance merging both JAR files? Lots of thanks.
While running tests with Maven I have encountered a NoClassDefFoundError, caused by ClassNotFoundException. The class which was not found definitely exists in my local repository. The problematic dependency looks like this: a default scoped dependency depends on a jar which scope is a marked as provided, and the file which was not found by the classloader is located inside that jar. It compiles ok, by the file cannot be found while runnig the app. I have fixed the error by adding that "provided jar" explicitely to my pom as a runtime-scoped dependency, but I want to understand whats going on. 1) What is the meaning of dependency scope = provided if I am running some tests? I understand that a servlet container can have some provided jars, such as servlet-api.jar, but what about tests? This looks like an error in our pom, isn't it? Is there any other case except from servlet-api.jar (and similair web-server jars) when we should use the "provided" scope? 2) I tried to use a maven command-line parameter -U while looking for the solution of this problem. As far as I understand, it forces Maven to check the remote repository and take most fresh the dependencies from there if necessary. A question is: whats going on if I am not specifying this command? It will always get the outdated dependencies from local repository? If not, then why I need this command? 3) For solving issues like this it is good to know which jars are really on classpath when compiling the code, and which are there when running the code. Is it possible with Maven?
I have a program with hundreds of threads that I have to debug. If I don't have any breakpoints enabled, it takes about 3 seconds to run with the debugger attached. With a breakpoint enabled, it takes about two minutes for the debugger to show that we are suspended. Once I click resume, the program instantly finishes, but the debugger takes another two minutes to show that the thread is resumed. I can't get rid of all the threads. The network is fairly fast between me and the remote point, I get about 300KB in each direction with a file transfer. I don't see very much eclipse network activity. I'd like to understand this lag and get rid of it if possible. If it's caused by shoving all the thread state over the network, I'd like to ignore the threads I don't care about. I'd like to ignore the hundreds of other threads, except for the one I need to debug. Or maybe ignore all of them until a breakpoint is hit. If such a feature exists, I'd like to use it. If not, I'd want to create it. So, as for a direct question: How can I speed up my remote debugging? EDIT I'm running a webserver type program on a test system. The only person accessing it externally is me, so the webserver stuff shouldn't be interfering with any other network traffic.
I am struggling with this issue for some time now and I think it is time that I appeal to the SO community. When creating a new Android Project in Eclipse I am trying to reference an external project [for the time being, it is a simple class with a function that returns a string]. I have tried adding a reference to the project itself, I have tried exporting a .JAR file [adding it to the libs folder] but none of these solutions work, though at compile time the classes are seen, at run time I get the dreaded NoClassDefFoundError. Because the JAR file is present both in the filesystem and the .classpath file, I believe there might be an issue with the way I exported the JAR. I am not sure why it doesn't work or what the proper workflow is for adding such [non-Android] modules to a project. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I have come across this issue in a lot of SO questions but I could not find any solutions that would work
Suppose I want to write an application that is targeting some JRE version (e.g. 1.6), but on the machine that I use to develop it, there is a newer version of the JRE installed (e.g. 1.7). The naive approach is to set the compiler level to 1.6 (I use Eclipse, but that's probably not very important, since the problem is general). However, that is not sufficient. Setting the source level for the compiler ensures that the source files use only the language features available for that Java version and therefore the generated class files have the right minor version, so the target JVM will be able to load and run them. But there is another and more subtle problem: If I use a class or a method in my code which was added in 1.7 and try to run the app on the machine with 1.6 runtime installed, it fails with a NoClassDefFoundError or a NoSuchMethodError. The problem is that the same program runs fine on the dev machine, because the 1.7 JDK installed on it does contain these classes. The compiler or the IDE do not complain either. The only indicators that I'm referencing classes and methods that won't be available are the Since 1.7 comments in JavaDoc. So how to ensure that I never use classes or methods that won't be available in an older version of the JRE? Is the only reliable solution to always have the exact target JRE version on the build path? That would mean that I would need to install an extra JDK on my dev machine for every such case (1.7, 1.6, possibly 1.5, maybe even 1.4).
I am starting web development with JSP, and I have been working on my application or a while. I have a custom logging class, which is in my personal library. I don't want to export the library to a jar file every time I make a change, so I have added my Eclipse library to the build path by right clicking on my web app, going to Build Path --> Projects --> Add --> (library name). Eclipse does not pick up an error when I import it into my Java classes. Although, I call a method from one of my application's classes, (which has imported my custom logging class), and it throws a ClassNotFoundException. I have looked online, and (correct me if I'm wrong) it looks like the way to solve this is to export my library to a jar file and put it under the /(project)/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib folder, and then put it into the build path. I do not want to do this, as I make many changes to my library, very frequently. So how can I get Tomcat to recognize that my library is in the build path without exporting it? Thanks in advance.
I have successfully installed JRI and rJava on Windows 7. I am now trying to get it to work on Ubuntu with 64bit OS. I can make rJava calls from within R but getting JRI to work is more difficult. I am running NetBeans 7.1.2 and I have followed various tricks in setting R_HOME and java.library.path to enable all the classes to be loaded. That is, I am past the error messages such as "jri library not found" and "R_HOME not set". From my java code,I can see that R_HOME = /usr/lib64/R. The error message I get now is Fatal error: you must specify '--save', '--no-save' or '--vanilla' This happens when Rengine is first called: Rengine r = new Rengine(args,false,null); This appears to be an error message from R; it seems to be expecting a command line argument. I haven't seen any posting with this error message. Any ideas? Thanks, Peter
Every thing is working fine when my netty server is not loaded. But under load it starts to fail. Currently I am using all default settings ( have not set any options ). Please suggest if I need to set any options for handling 2k+ concurrent connections (may close and open very frequently during load) Here is stack trace with netty 3.2.7. I upgraded to netty 3.3.1 , but it still fails. 2012-09-19 16:17:54,864 New I/O server worker #1-11 DEBUG org.jboss.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler 42 Swallowing an exception raised while writing non-app data java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException: null at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioWorker.cleanUpWriteBuffer(NioWorker.java:645) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioWorker.writeFromUserCode(NioWorker.java:372) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioServerSocketPipelineSink.handleAcceptedSocket(NioServerSocketPipelineSink.java:137) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioServerSocketPipelineSink.eventSunk(NioServerSocketPipelineSink.java:76) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.Channels.write(Channels.java:632) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.Channels.write(Channels.java:593) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.wrapNonAppData(SslHandler.java:831) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.unwrap(SslHandler.java:915) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.wrapNonAppData(SslHandler.java:849) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.unwrap(SslHandler.java:915) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.decode(SslHandler.java:620) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.frame.FrameDecoder.callDecode(FrameDecoder.java:282) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.frame.FrameDecoder.messageReceived(FrameDecoder.java:216) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.Channels.fireMessageReceived(Channels.java:274) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.Channels.fireMessageReceived(Channels.java:261) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioWorker.read(NioWorker.java:351) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioWorker.processSelectedKeys(NioWorker.java:282) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioWorker.run(NioWorker.java:202) ~[netty-3.2.7.Final.jar:na] at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.runTask(Unknown Source) [na:1.6.0_26] at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source) [na:1.6.0_26] at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) [na:1.6.0_26]
this functionality used to work and now it seems broken, I a do not know how to diagnose it. I am developing a java Applet that runs in a browser. I used to set up the runtime parameters in the java console to (Windows platform): -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xnoagent -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=n,suspend=n This setting appears both in the User and System tabs in the Java console. Then I would start a debug session in eclipse for my applet project and set it to listen on port 8000. When I launch the browser and the applet is loaded, it would attach to eclipse and I was able to debug and set breakpoints, etc. Now, it seems that this is no longer happening. When I launch the debug session in Eclipse, I do see port in LISTENING mode and owned by javaw.exe, which is correct. The only problem is that when the browser loads the Java plugin, it does not honor the "Runtime Parameters" and does not connect to the listening debug session in eclipse. I have the latest Java update installed. What else should I be looking into?
I have some plugin type classes whose thread safety and exception handling I cannot guarantee (let's say to be coded by some third person in future). The main Application does know these only through a "plugin" Interface, and doesn't care what they do internally. Except that the application can't afford to crash or freeze due to some exception thrown or thread lock in these plugin classes. Plugin classes are not dependent on main application, just carry out some commands from main application. Only two other interactions being: Call a method of an interface (supplied by main app as method arg) , when asynchronous task complete. provide a GUI for configuration. (main application simply asks and adds/removes this from a JPanel container, nothing more.) What are some good ways to achieve this ? I'm thinking of a wrapper with Synchronized,try-catch calls to actual plugin methods. Can AOP interceptors be employed here ? Any other way to sandbox a class in Java ?
I am facing a very weird problem. This is one of those errors that just doesn't make sense. Please read till the end before jumping to conclusions. When I deploy our web application (.ear file) containing web services written in Apache CXF on JBoss without making any changes to the web.xml file, everything seems to work fine. When I make some changes to the web.xml file and rebuild the ear and redeploy the application, JBoss is unable to deploy my application because of some class loader conflicts. This is completely alright because I am expecting JBoss to throw these errors. After I stop the JBoss server instance and revert the changes made in Step 2 to the web.xml and rebuild my .ear file and redeploy the application in JBoss, the same errors that were thrown in Step 2 are thrown again. How is this possible considering that I reverted all the changes I had made to the web.xml in Step 2 and restarted JBoss with a fresh .ear file to use? I even tried downloading a fresh copy of JBoss and rebuilding and redeploying the application on the fresh copy. The same errors that were displayed in Step 2 are displayed in the application even though the web.xml no longer contains the changes that were made in step 2. The only way I am able to get rid of the errors is by taking a fresh checkout of my code base and building my application and deploying a fresh version of my application in a fresh JBoss server. This doesn't make sense because changing the web.xml doesn't implicitly change other files or classes in the application as far as my knowledge goes. I am clueless about how to solve this problem. The only change I make is to the web.xml file and I don't touch any other classes or files. Why do the errors persist permanently?
I am trying to create a chart with invient charts in vaadin. I added relevant jars and create another application servlet which points to jquery highchart and modules files and modified the web.xml file. When I add my pie chart code; I get the following from the browser ; Widgetset does not contain implementation for com.invient.vaadin.charts.InvientCharts.

I have a Android App I have developed, It has been created from a successful ios App that was released and works fine. On one device it works correctly, no errors and does not crash. However on another device (newer, newer version of Android, faster processor) it crashes. Here are the memory errors when it crashes. The app is designed to take a picture and to then use that picture as the background for a canvas, then a screen shot is taken. I can go through this process once, but then if I repeat the process and take another picture, the application crashes on exit of the camera API for the second time. And displays these errors. The application is Developed in Eclipse using Phonegap and Jquery mobile. I am unsure which parts of my code I should post to help this problem, but please feel free to ask if you feel some may be relevant. Any help is really appreciated.
I found this tutorial: http://blog.infrared5.com/2012/05/red5-authentication/ and tried to build it. I use netbeans and created a freeform project on the "server" directory. Everything went well but the build faild becuse it couldn't download some Spring framework libraries (security acl, config and core). I found them manually, downloaded the same version it needed (3.0.7). This error went away but changed to some Java compile-time errors. :-( For example: Compiling 6 source files to /Users/ist1/Downloads/red5-auth/server/www/WEB-INF/classes /Users/ist1/Downloads/red5-auth/server/src/org/red5/demo/auth/AggregatedUserDetailsService.java:29: package org.springframework.security.core.userdetails does not exist import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails; /Users/ist1/Downloads/red5-auth/server/src/org/red5/demo/auth/AggregatedUserDetailsService.java:30: package org.springframework.security.core.userdetails does not exist import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailsService; /Users/ist1/Downloads/red5-auth/server/src/org/red5/demo/auth/AggregatedUserDetailsService.java:31: package org.springframework.security.core.userdetails does not exist import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UsernameNotFoundException; /Users/ist1/Downloads/red5-auth/server/src/org/red5/demo/auth/AggregatedUserDetailsService.java:38: cannot find symbol symbol: class UserDetailsService public class AggregatedUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService, ApplicationContextAware { /Users/ist1/Downloads/red5-auth/server/src/org/red5/demo/auth/AggregatedUserDetailsService.java:47: cannot find symbol symbol : class UserDetails location: class org.red5.demo.auth.AggregatedUserDetailsService public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String userName) throws UsernameNotFoundException { What should I do now? I'm quite new in Red5 and haven't used Java for a long time ago.
So this is not an error but rather a thought, I have a java class, Jform1, which is a JForm. I am trying to take only double values in to the 3 textfields and then do some computation with these numbers. But if the user fails to enter the double values and enters any characters I want to throw an exception, not just display that the it is a char and not valid either in a label or a dialogbox. So I want to create a *entered_Valuenotvalid* exception class how do I do that? I can't even think of how to do that, mainly because this is a seprate class itself and then the Jform is a seprate class so if error happens here then i have to get the exception from the *entered_Valuenotvalid* class. the only thing I can think of is extending the *entered_Valuenotvalid* class, or is there a better way to do that.
Many a carefully crafted piece of Java code has been laid to waste by java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. There seems to be no relief from it, even production class code gets downed by it. The question I wish to ask is: are there good programming/architecture practices where you can avoid hitting this error. So the tools at a Java programmers disposal seem to be: java.lang.Runtime.addShutdownHook(Thread hook) -- shutdown hooks allow for a graceful fall. java.lang.Runtime.freeMemory() -- allows us to check the memory available to the VM So the thought I had is: could one write factory methods which before the creation of objects check if the system has adequate memory left before attempting to allocate memory? For example in C, the malloc would fail and you would know that you had run out of memory, not an ideal situation but you wouldn't just drop dead from an java.lang.OutOfMemoryError aneurism. A suggested approach is to do better memory management or plug memory leaks or simply allocate more memory -- I do agree these are valuable points but lets look at the following scenarios: I'm running on an Amazon micro instance I can allocate very little memory to my VM say 400M My Java process processes jobs in a multi-threaded fashion, each thread consumes a variable amount of memory depending on the parameters of the computational task Let's assume that my process has no memory leaks Now if I keep feeding it jobs before they are complete it will eventually die of memory starvation If I set -Xmx too high -- I'll get swapping and possibly thrashing on the OS If I set an upper concurrently limit -- that might not be optimal as I could be limiting the accepting of a job which could be executed with the available RAM or worse accept a job that requires a LOT of memory and end up hitting java.lang.OutOfMemoryError anyway. X. Hope that helps explain the motivation of the question -- I think the standard responses are not mutually exclusive to seeking a fault tolerant approach to the problem. Thanks in advance.
I have a request where i need to write the content on db from application running in Server A to Same application running in another instance Server B. DB read write are via SOAP API's Both server do have their own client.truststore file. From a stand alone Server C using Server A's client.trustsrore i am able to read write to Server A's DB And using Server B's client truststore am able to read write in to Server B's DB. Since the requirement is to read from Server A and write into Server B. I introduced a new keystore file in both the servers and i set the system.properties properly (Both keystore location and password). and this keystore was copied properly in to both servers with permissions. I created the certificate using private key and then created keystore file using keytool command. Since keeping the keystore file in 2 server didn't work. It always complained unknown_certificate. I tried to import the certificate to cacerts under /$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/. But even this gives unknow certificate with handshake exception. Is there anything else i want to do which i am missing? Regards Dheeraj Joshi
Sorry if this has been posted somewhere I've been working/looking for days. The Problem: I'm getting SocketTimeoutExceptions when communicating via a peer to peer network with android devices. Details: The android devices use their own mobile network and not wifi when this happens(wifi wasn't designed to work with this anyways). The android devices successfully get their ipAddress from whatismyip.com. One device will send the other their ip address via other means than the peer to peer network we're using. The ip address of the remote device will come successfully to the local device. When the local device responds via the peer to peer network a TimeoutException occurs. What I've tried: Extending the timeout to significantly long periods of time. Using other android devices. Notable: It should be noted that this same peer to peer network has been tested to successfully work amongst PCs(running linux and windows if that matters) on a local area network. Also just tested the peer to peer network across our wired internet connections on our PCs and it definitely works. My guess: I'm thinking that the device is hidden by the isp somehow and I'm going to have to write some code to do something similar to nat traversal but I'm not quite sure. But then again if the device is being hidden I should get a connection refused exception. Any help is much appreciated. P.S. I'm unable to post code at the moment and even if I could it's a couple thousand lines of code for the whole process.
I am in the process of development of a stand-alone (Swing) Java EE client. The application server is JBoss 6.1.0. Some Windows workstations freeze while the client is running, some do not. Both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows workstations freeze, and again, some 32-bit and 64-bit Windows workstations work perfectly. The client runs well on Linux without any problems. I have followed instructions from StackOverflow where people suggested to disable direct draw with -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true. It did not help. What puzzles me the most is that some workstations are almost identical - the same Windows version, the same graphics drivers, the same JRE, yet some work well, some do not. The application uses the Preferences API a lot to store various positions of dockables (from the Docking Frames project), it uses JBoss client classes. I am in the process of investigating if perhaps concurrent access to the Windows registry is causing this problem (if you had similar problems please let me know)... First guess was that a race condition occurs somewhere in the GUI thread, and the GUI freezes. But that would freeze only the GUI, it should not freeze the whole Windows. The machine, once frozen, responds to pings, however no Windows service works. I would appreciate any hint that can help me solve the problem. Edit: CPU usage is always around 10%. Number of threads never goes above 30, however not all threads are daemon threads (this includes AWT threads, RMI threads, etc).

This came up in a discussion with a colleague today. The Javadocs for Java's IllegalStateException state that it: Signals that a method has been invoked at an illegal or inappropriate time. In other words, the Java environment or Java application is not in an appropriate state for the requested operation. And Effective Java says (Item 60, page 248): Another commonly reused exception is IllegalStateException. This is generally the exception to throw if the invocation is illegal because of the state of the receiving object. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller attempted to use some object before it had been properly initialized. It seems there's a bit of discrepancy here. The second sentence of the javadocs makes it sound like the exception could describe a very broad condition about the Java execution state, but the description in Effective Java makes it sound like it's used for conditions related specifically to the state of the state of the object whose method has been called. The usages I've seen in the JDK (e.g. collections, Matcher) and in Guava definitely seem to fall into the category that Effective Java talks about ("This object is in a state where this method can't be called"). This also seems consistent with IllegalStateException's sibling IllegalArgumentException. Are there any legitimate IllegalStateException usages in the JDK that do relate to the "Java environment" or "Java application"? Or do any best practices guides advocate using it for the broader execution state? If not, why the heck are the javadocs phrased like that? ;)
I have a relatively simple web application deployed on WebLogic that is using an Oracle database. When I finished developing the app and was ready to deploy it to the actual Linux server that the production WebLogic instance lives on, the app would throw a DuplicateKeyException on all inserts. If I run the app on my local windows machine and point the remote database, the app works just fine. I should also note that all reads from the database work perfectly with no issue in both environments. I have since removed any primary key constraints on the table just to narrow down the issue, but every time I execute the insert query on the Linux deployment, it fails. Locally using the same code, same remote database, same version of WL (10.3.6) it works perfectly. So the big variable here is that same WAR file throws a DuplicateKeyException on the Linux 10.3.6 WL server, but it doesn't on the Windows. And the Linux instance is actually on an Oracle hosted environment, so while the DB and WL are on different servers, I would think that since my read commands work, the hosted environment shouldn't have anything to do with my inserts failing. Any suggestions or help on this would be greatly appreciated. I'm not a Linux guy, just a Java developer and am at my wits end on this one. Thanks.
I worte a 'java' program to get coordinates(latitude and longitude) for a given postalcode using geocoding. I tested that program at my home it is working fine, but when i run the same program in my office it is throwing 'network error'. the stack trace is like below.

I've been given the task to implement a new end-user functionality into a Java/Swing application. The task to implement is relatively easy and straightforward. What is cumbersome is the existing app to be modified. It comprises dozens of classes which often break the 2000 lines barrer and sometimes reach 10000 lines. Documentation is non existent and it is unfeasible to read all the source code to get the big picture of it. The app itself is basically a GUI tool to draw diagrams (e.g. flowcharts) and is open-source (I can post the link to the source code if it helps). So far I've managed to import the source code into an Eclipse project and use the SwingExplorer plugin to identify some of the GUI components. The most 'interesting' part of the app is the canvas onto which the diagram is drawn. It is implemented as a single class (about 9700 lines long) that inherits from JComponent. The parts of the displayed diagram can't be selected in SwingExplorer: the whole canvas is only identified as a single instance of the aforementioned class. I hence guess that this huge single class is taking care of all the user interactions and AWT drawing operations for the diagram and returning just some kind of image buffer to display (but this is a huge guess). My modification involves doing computation on the diagram as it is being drawn on the canvas. Therefore it is going to be a new class which will receive and process events broadcast during the creation of specific elements of the diagram, and then do some computation on them. My main problem is: how to debug the event flow? How can I follow the flow of execution when drawing a diagram and see which events are generated, processed and also get an idea of where in memory the objects being drawn reside? I know this question might seem too generic, but I'm really clueless and looking for a starting point. Thanks in advance only for taking the time to read through ;) Regards, Marco
I just done with developement of Android application so now i want to release. For release i am using ant command line tool to build a release version of my apk. I just executed the command ant release and got this Errors BUILD FAILED /usr/src/android-sdk-linux/tools/ant/build.xml:679: The following error occurred while executing this line: /usr/src/android-sdk-linux/tools/ant/build.xml:692: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.

I have searched SO and tried all the solutions I came across but nothing seems to work. The things I tried are the solutions given here, here, here, here and here but nothing seems to work. As described in some of those question I have a java library (lets say J) included in a android library (AL) that is included in a android app (AA). I have added the library to the libs of both (have also tried with adding it to just AA and including in AL, and vice-versa and just in AL and expecting android dependencies to take care of it) but that or anything else did not work. I am using the latest tools(version 20.0.3). The build android version for the android library and the app is 2.2 and min SDK is 5. I can see the the java library in the android dependencies of the app but am getting a NoClassDefFoundException and run time. How can I get this to work? The android library must reference a jar, since that contains some encryption logic that I need to hide. The library is being created for distribution, the app is just something quite simple for testing the library.
Before you burn me alive because of the low level informations, let me explain why... I really don't get where this error is coming from... So I don't know where I could be messing up It's basically an error wich comes from time to times and the only way I can solve is reinstalling Netbeans along with Glassfish and pray for not coming back. I change some random class, and boom! This error appears. Not even erasing all that I've code so far can solve. Glassfish grant me with this error(There's more in the log, but I guess its not worth putting here): Exception while loading the app : java.lang.IllegalStateException: ContainerBase.addChild: start: org.apache.catalina.LifecycleException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract in class file com/enterprise/dao/SomeClassDao The funny part is... I didn't change this class, It doesnt have any relation with the one I was working on! Thanks in advance!
I am struggling hard to compile a GWT project. I confirmed that GWT, AppEngine and necessary library are referenced to the project (added in the Java Build Path, also GWT is installed successfully from Marketplace). Using the setting above, I tried to build using GWT and I have been getting java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/gwt/dev/Compiler over and over again. Then tried to set gwt-dev.jar in Windows CLASSPATH, and I could get off from this error but ended up with [ERROR] Unable to find 'some/package/My_Project.gwt.xml' on your classpath; could be a typo, or maybe you forgot to include a classpath entry for source? I tried to set project classpath to some/package/ but didn't work. Even I could manage to get over with this error for once, again I got into another error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/appengine/tools/enhancer/Enhance. I screwed up the environment and couldn't get to the last error I was getting, and I was just stuck on the second error. I have tried removing all Run Configuration, creating new workspace and import projects from scratch and tried everything that I found on Google.
I'm a little lost on how to handle unchecked exceptions in my GUI application. I e.g. have a function that saves a company newly created by the user in a (embedded) database. The function for saving the newly created company throws 3 Exceptions: IllegalArgumentException: If the company or a not null field is null (Manually checked and thrown). EntityExistException: If the company (it's name) already exists. (Also manually checked and thrown). PersistenceException: If something went wrong when trying to save. (Catched and rethrown). The function that calls the saveCompany method catches all 3 Exceptions and then logs them and shows a dialog to the user that an error had occurred. Im now wondering if i need to catch them at all? Or would it be ok to just let them run up to the globalExceptionHandler (where i can also look them)? And im also wondering what my reaction should be? Should I tell the user that there was an error and let the program run (cause other parts of the program should function properly) or should I tell him and then end the program (cause it's a programmers error that shouldn't be in there)?

I am developing a web application and have hit a wall and could use some advice. So the application was written by a coworker who is no longer at our company. They wrote a web application for Apache Tomcat with Java and Javascript in the back end. The application makes use of the JDBC api to interface with a SQL Server database. This person did all the development in Eclipse and running it this way. I am trying to take this web application and move it to a server. I attempted this by using Eclipse to export a WAR file and then placing this within the Tomcat webapps folder. Then when I started Tomcat the program was extracted. So far so good. The website comes up and works well. However, when I try to access the pages which rely upon database info everything is coming up NULL. I went through the Tomcat logs and found that in the standard out the following message was given: ClassNotFoundException: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver I had assumed that the WAR file would include all dependencies but I am guessing that probably this is not the case. If anyone is experienced, is this what has happened? If anyone out there is aware, is there a way to tell Eclipse to do this? Otherwise, what is my option? I am not a Java dev and so I would not know how to install JDBC if needed. Any help is appreciated. Mike
I am looking to get some ideas on how I can solve my failover problem in my Java service. At a high level, my service receives 3 separate object streams of data from another service, performs some amalgamating logic and then writes to a datastore. Each object in the stream will have a unique key. Data from the 3 streams can arrive simultaneously, there is no guaranteed ordering. After the data arrives, it will be stored in some java.util.concurrent collection, such as a BlockingQueue or a ConcurrentHashMap. The problem is that this service must support failover, and I am not sure how to resolve this if failover were to take place when data is stored in an in-memory object. One simple idea I have is the following: Write to a file/elsewhere when receiving an object, and prior to adding to queue When an object is finally procesed and stored in the datastore When failover occurs, ensure that same file is copied across and we know which objects we need to receive data for Performance is a big factor in my service, and as IO is expensive this seems like a crude approach and is quite simplistic. Therefore, I am wondering if there are any libraries etc out there that can solve this problem easily?
I am trying to connect to Mercury mail server with a java application and I am using JavaMail api. The connection is not successful and I’m getting this error in the log: EHLO x.x.x.x 554 Invalid HELO format Which means that it connects to the server but the helo format is not something that sever likes. I've tired to debug it and I got to this code in JavaMail “SMTPTransport” class which says: serverOutput.write(cmdBytes); serverOutput.write(CRLF); serverOutput.flush(); and according to code: private static final byte[] CRLF = { (byte)'\r', (byte)'\n' }; which seems consistent with RFC 821 I know that on windows \n has different meaning but I am not sure if this really is the root of problem? If it not then what can cause this? I checked mail server with mail client and it works fine and I checked the code with James mails server and it also works fine! JavaMail API version is: 1.4.5 (latest release) Mercury/32 : 4.7
I just tried to migrate our working Java projects from Netbeans 6.9.1 to Netbeans 7.2 and I'm experiencing a problem due to one of our project dependencies being an external JAR which uses JNI. I created a copy of our project directory and simply opened the copies of NB projects originally created with the older version of the IDE. Everything went smooth. I can build the projects and run compiled executable JAR-s outside of Netbeans without any problems. However when I try to debug the project, the application fails to init properly due to said dependency JAR with JNI. It's like the JAR is failing to find a DLL associated with it (giving me java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError as a result). This does not happen with 6.9.1! Why would this be happening? Do I need to explicitly set java.library.path in NB7+? There were no changes made to the projects (not by us) and the same JDK is being used in both versions of the IDE. I suspect the newer version applies changes to the project setup silently and breaks something in the process. Anyone experienced something similar? Edit 1: Tried fiddling with project.properties, setting -Djava.library.path VM arg, different JDKs/JREs, ... all to no avail. This is driving me nuts. Obviously I'm doing something wrong.
Possible Duplicate: Java serialization - java.io.InvalidClassException local class incompatible I have written a program that stores an Object (say A) as a file (say F). So when you run the program later you can load it and use its contents. So far so good. But today i decided to make a some changes to class A. I made a backup of the original (called it Aold). But the thing i realized too late, is that the information stored on F is very valuable to me. And ofcourse when i tried to load it as a new Object A it failed. Next i wrote a converter, that takes a file with an Aold object as its contents and turns it into a new A class (still with me?) next writes it back to disk. This, so that next time my program can load it directly. I renamed oldA to A again. But the horror. the horror. I got this exception when i tried to load and A object from disk: java.io.InvalidClassException: model.A; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = -4621085703760431015, local class serialVersionUID = -3183461156231139807 Did i just messed up, and is the information lost? Or is there a solution?
I have some questions regarding handling exceptions in Java. I read a bit about it and got some contradicting guidelines. Best Practices for Exception Handling Let's go through the mentioned article: It states that one should generally avoid using checked exceptions if "Client code cannot do anything". But what does it exactly mean? Is displaying error message in GUI sufficient reason for bubbling up checked exception? But it would force GUI programmer to remember to catch RuntimeExceptions and their descendants to display potential error info. Second view presented in this article is that one should evade inventing own exception classes unless I want to implement some customs field/methods in them. I generally disagree with this, my practice up today was just the opposite: I wrapped exceptions in my own exception structure to reflex goals realized by classes I write, even if they just extend Exception without adding any new methods. I think it helps to handle them more flexibly in the higher layers when thrown plus it's generally more clear and comprehensible for programmer who will use these classes. I implemented some code today 'new way' presented in the article throwing RuntimeException here and there, then I let Sonar analyze it. To confuse me even more Sonar marked my RuntimeExceptions as Major errors with a message like "Avoid throwing root type exceptions, wrap'em in your own types". So it looks quite controversional, what do you think? I also heard from one of tech-leads today that just wrapping exceptions is bad, 'because it's a really costly operation for JVM'. For me, on the other side throwing SQLExceptions or IOExceptions everywhere looks like a bit of breaking encapsulation.. So what is your general attitude to questions I presented here? When to wrap exceptions in my own types, when I shouldn't do this? Where is that point of 'client cannot do anything about this, throw runtime exception?' What about performance issues?
I am trying to implement the APK Expansion Downloader Library into my application, but I am struggling to get past the LVL verification check. Everytime I run up the application, I get a "Signature verification failed" message back from the LicenseValidator class. The application is signed in release mode, with a proper Keystore. I have checked maybe 10+ times that the PUBLIC_KEY I am using inside of the application is the same as on the developer account, yet its still not working. I have also uploaded the application to the Play Store, with the expansion file (correctly named), and even added in my account as a Test account on the developer console. I have also tried adding the publisher account onto my device, and its still not working. I do not know what to do next, I need this to work and cannot find any help on the internet as to how to fix this. Thanks Adam
Since Notes/Domino version 7 I have used the principles in Bob Balaban's "Two headed beast" (http://bobzblog.com/tuxedoguy.nsf/dx/the-2-headed-beast-debugging-domino-java-agents-with-eclipse) for writing Java agents in Eclipse that can be debugged! This works like a charm - the only thing is that I have had to copy/paste the code from Eclipse to the standard Notes agent. With the current Eclipse version (8.5.3 FP2) of Domino Designer I tried to see if I could use the same setup to debug agents directly (as Java programs) in Domino Designer. It seems that I can make the code run, however, I cannot make it stop at any breakpoints. The message I get is: Unable to install breakpoint in dk.domain.AgentTemplate due to missing line number attributes. Modify the compiler options to generate line number attributes. I have tried to set the debug configuration to "Stop in main". And it does seem to stop. However, if I step over, it runs all of the code - and I cannot see where in the code I am, and of course I cannot see the variables nor their values. The option in Preferences - Java - Compiler to "Add line number attributes to generated class files" has been selected. I have not found other compiler option to generate line numbers. I am using Java 1.5 compliance in Designer. Has anyone been able to set this up?? /John
We're using JSF 1.2 for our application. There is a selectBooleanCheckbox on on of the screens that represents a field in the backing bean. When loading the JSP, the value is shown correctly. There are three command buttons on the page; one calls a save function in the backing bean and then navigates to another screen. The other two are used to call utility methods in the backing bean before refreshing the screen. If the checkbox is unchecked, all three buttons function correctly. If the checkbox is checked, only the first functions as intended. When the checkbox is selected, the backing bean is initialized but before the methods are called, a noSuchElementException is thrown from the generated servlet. The exception has a null message and no stack trace, so it's not incredibly helpful. I've verified that the values of each field remain consistent with those that the screen is originally populated with. Dropdown inconsistencies are the only times I've ever seen this before, so any pointers on what else to check would be greatly appreciated. Unfortunately, I'm unable to post the code here but I will answer any questions if I am able.
I'm enhancing a client, which is part of a bigger project. Because of the lack of speed i was forced to switch to CNI and therefore i had to generate native code with the GNU-gcj compiler (gnu 4.6.3). The compiling and linking works fine (thanks to the -findirect-dispatch flag) and i don't have any problems executing the output. But when it comes to the communication between the client and the server, the client immediately disconnects. The reason: [XStreamClient Reader] WARN - Client disconnected (Exception: com.thoughtworks.xstream.io.StreamException: Cannot create XmlPullParser) (This Exeption only appears in the gcj compiled version of the client. When i run the code with the java interpreter - things work well (but too slow^^)) --> The challenging part is that i can't retrieve the source code of where this exception occurs because it is in a pre-compiled (Java class files) library the client uses. (And I cannot contact the author of that library) I guess the library invokes the XppReader which then tries to create a XmlPullParser class and fails. I bind in the XStream (vers. 1.4.3) library (and other required *.jars) by unpacking them and compiling the created *.class files and then linking the object files. This seems to work for all other librarys, too. (My OS=Ubuntu) What i already did to overcome this problem: I googled intensively for XStream/XmlPullParser and gcj and replaced the "xmlpull"- and "kxml2"-files with different versions. But nothing worked. Does anyone of you have a clue of what might be the solution? EDIT: I figured out that the reason why the XmlPullParser creation fails is that the META-INF directory with the /services/org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserFactory file can not be found by the XmlPullParserFactory.newInstance function. This is due to the fact that i only compiled and linked the *.jar's *.class files. So as soon as i found i way to link the META-INF directory into the executable in away that the function can find and access it, the problem should be solved. Does anyone of you already know a way to do so?
I have a Java application that uses lots of java.sql.Connection to a database. I want to test that, if the database is unavailable, my services return the appropriate error codes (distinguishing between temporary and permanent problems e.g. HTTP 500 and 503). For testing, my application connects to an embedded, local, in-memory h2 database; the application is not aware of this, only my integration test is. How can I make writes to the database fail deterministically, e.g. hook into commits and make them throw a custom SQLException? I want a global 'database is unavailable' boolean in the test code that affects all connections and makes my application exercise its reconnect logic. (I had started by proxying Connection and putting an if(failFlag) throw new MySimulateFailureException() in commit(); but this didn't catch PreparedStatement.executeUpdate(); before I embark on proxying the PreparedStatement too - its a lot of methods! - I'd like to be taught a better way...)
I went through the getting started section in the Google App Engine for Java. I installed the following software: Eclipse EE IDE (Version: Juno Release Build id: 20120614-1722) plugin GWT SDK 2.4.0 plugin eclipse 4.2 plugin GAE Java SDK 1.7.2.1 plugin GWT designer 2.6.0 Oracle Java SE 7u9 Chome extension GWT Developer Plugin 1.0.1133 I tried creating a hello world google web application that uses both GWT and GAE SDKs, but when I try and run it in debug mode it creates a URL which when I click on it gives the error message: "Could not load GWT DMP Plugin". I am running Chrome Version 22.0.1229.94 m If I try creating a hello world google web application with only GAE SDK it does not seem to work at all. I followed the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/ but there weren't very clear on the versions of eclipse to download and use or the version of Java to download and use. Does anybody else have the same issues or can you tell me what I am doing wrong??
I wrote a Java servlet filter on my local machine and deployed it a remote (machine) web server. Unfortunately, it's been very difficult and time-consuming trying to trace errors reported by Apache Tomcat 5.5, my JSP/servlet engine. I can't keep writing System.out.println(...), saving, deploying, testing JSP pages, and so on. It's taking too long. There has to be a better, faster way. Is it possible to remotely debug servlet filters? I don't have a web server on my local machine, which is why I'm asking about remote debugging. Specifically, I'm looking for a way to debug, line-by-line, the servlet filter, on-the-fly, as it's happening on the remote web server. Does such a method exist? Or, is there a better method than writing to standard output. It's taking too long and I feel that must be a more efficient means of debugging Java servlet filters. Note: I'm using Eclipse for development. Thank you very much for any help. Update Thank you all for your help. I really appreciate it. I added the JVM argument to Tomcat, restarted Tomcat. Then, on the machine with Eclipse, I entered in the appropriate info in the Debug config, put the breakpoint in, and tested. Unfortunately, it did not work. In the config, I left it as Socket Attach, clicked apply, and that was it. I pressed the debug button and it said the connection was refused. I tried ports 8000 and 8001 and both did not work. Let me explain what I'm trying to do, that might be better. I have a login page called login.jsp. On that page, is a form whose action attribute is servlet/LoginServlet. When the user submits the form, it calls servlet/LoginServlet, which is mapped to a class in the web.xml file. Let's call this class com.mysite.mypkg.classA. In class A, it calls a method from another class called com.custom.mypkg.classB. I want to put a breakpoint in classB. So, using the url with login.jsp page in the Eclipse debugger won't call it. I tried using servlet/LoginServlet and that also did not work. What should I put in for the URL? Or, do I debug this type of setup? Thank you. Update 2 I found this site here, which is pretty comprehensive. I ran netstat -a and noticed that the debug port is not listed. Windows Firewall is turned off, but there could be another thing blocking the port, who knows. Anyway, I placed the VM argument here and it's not working. Thank you.
I am using the Google Calendar API and everything worked fine in an Eclipse stand-alone Java-Project. Now I wanted to add (the very same) code to my Eclipse Plug-in. Unfortunately, I now have the problem, that the authentication with the Google API doesn't work properly anymore. After AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp(flow, new LocalServerReceiver()).authorize("user"); the browser starts the authentication-process where I can click "Authenticate" after that the browser does something I don't know (infinite loading) and stops only if i cancle the programme. In the Eclipse console, I get the following error: !MESSAGE While loading class "org.mortbay.jetty.RetryRequest", thread "Thread[349166459@qtp-300209212-1 - Acceptor0 SocketConnector@localhost:18312,5,main]" timed out waiting (5005ms) for thread "Thread[main,6,main]" to finish starting bundle "myproject.version.qualifier [896]". To avoid deadlock, thread "Thread[349166459@qtp-300209212-1 - Acceptor0 SocketConnector@localhost:18312,5,main]" is proceeding but "org.mortbay.jetty.RetryRequest" may not be fully initialized. I don't know what this error means and what I can do. Thanks for your help! casaout PS: I have the working sample (only in a normal Eclipse project, NOT in an eclipse plug-in project) from here.
I am trying to hook a GAE project into our CI/automated build process. I'm running into an issue with using appcfg - I read docs here saying that a permanent token could be created for doing deployments using the --oauth2 flag. I tried this and I get the following error: C:\dwinq-ci\dependencies\appengine-java-sdk-1.7.2.1\bin>appcfg.cmd --oauth2 update C:/TeamCity/buildAgent/work/fd63022f430f2b8c/war Either the code entered is invalid or the token was revoked. If I try the command a second time, I get a different error: C:\dwinq-ci\dependencies\appengine-java-sdk-1.7.2.1\bin>appcfg.cmd --oauth2 update C:/TeamCity/buildAgent/work/fd63022f430f2b8c/war Bad argument: no JSON input found usage: AppCfg [options] [] [] This error is corrected by deleting a file created under my user directory, named .appcfg_oauth2_tokens_java Deleting the file only causes the first error to occur again though. Assistance with this is greatly appreciated. Right now, the only alternative I have is to manually go to the CI server and recreate the temporary token on a regular interval. This is not a good long-term solution.
I'm new on Stack Overflow so don't hold it against me if I make mistakes. Here is my problem, I created a simple Android app in Eclipse and when I try to run it I get this error : Error generating final archive: Failed to create key: Cannot run program "D:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\keytool.exe": CreateProcess error=2, Le fichier spécifié est introuvable JAVA_HOME is set to: D:\Program Files\Java\jre7 Update it if necessary, or manually execute the following command: "D:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\keytool.exe" -genkey -alias AndroidDebugKey -keyalg RSA -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US" -validity 10950 -keypass android -keystore C:\Users\Vincent.android\debug.keystore -storepass android LunarLander Unknown Android Packaging Problem I have tried JDK 1.6 & 1.7 for x64 & x86 each time. I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate x64. I tried running keytool.exe (JRE and JDK version) with cmd.exe and the explorer but it says : Windows cannot find "D:\Program Files\JAVA\jre7\bin\keytool.exe". Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file click the Start button, and then click search. Thinking it was a problem with the space between "Program" and "Files", I tried installing the JDK in "D:\Java\jdk...". EDIT : I found the solution ! All you need to do is to delete keytool.exe from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options in the registry.
I have an ant build script that builds many android projects. I am building all the projects in a specific order given to me by a property in a text file. The ant build script calls each project's own build.xml file to build that project. If a project fails to build, how could i have ant continue to build from where it stopped because of the error? Basically if i am building projects A, B, C, D and E. And the build process fails at C, what could i do to have the build process continue at C, when the developer starts the build again? Also, the build process would need to rebuild stuff that was changed by the developer. For instance, the problem in C was because of an issue in A, and C depends on A. So, it would need to rebuild A, skip B, and rebuild C and continue. o.O Looking for ideas or if there is already something that does this. Thanks!
Basic problem I've come across a bit of a problem while writing my own custom JSP tags to "wrap" the spring MVC form tags. I've wrapped other tags successfully but come unstuck with the select and options tags, this throws an IlleagalStateException. I've debugged the spring code and found that the options tag looks for an ancestor select tag. I'm doing this with tag files so the spring select tag is actually in a different tag file. I guess that's why it doesn't find it. So the questions is what can I do to get round this? Possible solutions I've tried looking for solutions but all I've found is other people having the same problem but no solution posted. I did ponder writing my own select and options tags without using the spring tags but I don't really want to have to replicate the binding that it gives you for free. I don't mind changing to use Java classes rather than tag files but I found previously that the output won't be evaluated as a JSP so you can't output another JSP tag. Reasons for doing this Having thought about this for a week since first asking the question I am now clearer on what I want to achieve. To simplify the markup needed in my JSP's Factoring out common code (e.g. form:errors after an input or getting a translation from spring:message) To encapsulate look and feel (CSS goes a long way but often you need to change the markup too) To be able to build enhanced components that extend the functionallity of the spring tags (e.g. render a multi-select as a picklist or display readonly inputs as text labels) I'll be interested to hear what people think. Thanks
I'm trying to generate some javadoc for some of my projects. The comments etc. is inside already, but when I click on "Project -> Generate Javadoc -> ..." in eclipse the javadoc simply doesn't get generated for one of my projects, while the others are fine. It even tries to open the index.html file but since no one has been created i just get a not found message by my browser. Since there is also no error output I don't know what the problem is or what I can do now to generate the javadoc for this specific project. I remember that I had this problem once already, but sadly I cannot remember how I exactly solved it that time. Is it possible that this has to deal something with invalid characters? Did someone of you ever experience this behaviour? What did you do to solve it? Have you any hints or tricks for me, how I can find out what stops the javadoc generation for this one project? Also, is there maybe a logfile or anything similiar, where I can see what error occured during the creation. Thanks a lot for your help EDIT: Or can I somehow activate creation output on the console to maybe find the error this way?
We have a Spring 2.0.8 application in production, running on Tomcat 5.5.x and JRE 1.5.x (yeah, I know, we should upgrade, that's not the point now), with Oracle 11g as our choice of DB. We have upgraded the application some months ago (I'd say July) and have switched from Oracle 10g to Oracle 11g in the past month or so (also changing the Oracle JDBC driver to match the database version). We've been having serious and unexpected problems in production. As of a day ago, there have been heap space OutOfMemory errors several hours apart. This in turn either slows down response time by about a 100 times, or the users can't connect. Our setup is: Windows machine to run the server Apache 2.2 and Tomcat 5.5 with SSO enabled, total memory: 128MB, max memory: 512MB Spring 2.0.8 Webapp Oracle 11g Since noticing this error, this is what we tried: checking out the logs - there doesn't seem to be a pattern. Obviously, logs only tell you when the server is out of memory, so they show the point of not working anymore, instead of the point where the problem started restarting server reinstalling Tomcat increasing amount of memory Tomcat can use - this just prolonged the issue, of course Tomcat ate just as much as we gave it fresh installation of both the server and Apache+Tomcat generating heap dumps - nothing spectacular seems out of the ordinary, most memory is used for starting up the application checking the DB - it's fine, quick and responsive, no locks I'm looking out for ideas on what else to do. We have this same setup in 5 different productions in total, this problematic one being with the smallest number of users and data.
We have a 64 bit linux machine and we make multiple HTTP connections to other services and Drools Guvnor website(Rule engine if you don't know) is one of them. In drools, we create knowledge base per rule being fired and creation of knowledge base makes a HTTP connection to Guvnor website. All other threads are blocked and CPU utilization goes up to ~100% resulting into OOM. We can make changes to compile the rules after 15-20 mins. but I want to be sure of the problem if someone has already faced it. I checked for "cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max" and it shows 27000 threads, Can it be a reason? I have a couple of question: When do we know that we are running over capacity? How many threads can be spawned internally (any rough estimate or formula relating diff parameters will work)? Has anyone else seen similar issues with Drools? Concurrent access to Guvnor website is basically causing the issue. Thanks,
I maintain a legacy application that was written with the Java 6 JDK. We deploy it as a stand alone application downloaded from the web as a JNLP. The application talks to a servlet that serves up data from a database, and since the data involved can get lengthy, the JNLP app provides a 'progress meter' to show how much data has transferred and how much is left to go. It was working all just fine - until, apparently, the latest Java 7 update. Now, when the JNLP application is run, during data transfer from the servlet, the progress meter stops working. It appears to get hung, yet data is continuing to be transferred (the servlet part is working just fine). But to our end users, the app appears to fail! I can run the app locally without Webstart, and it works fine. Any idea what the problem could be, and how to fix it?.
tl:dr Getting error: Java Build Path Problems - Archive for required library: library in project cannot be read or is not a valid ZIP file. This happens for two (~.so) I have included in the build path of an android project being developed in Eclipse. Am I doing something wrong by including the ~.so in the build path? I am trying to install the SPen SDK in my android project and I am having problems with including some of the native library files (~.so). I am trying to follow the tutorial specified here: Adding S Pen library to android project. It is point 2-2 on this page. I include the libspen22.jar to the build path which seems to be fine. But when I tried to run the application I get an error saying Java problems, with a list of 323 items stating that function foo must override a superclass method. I had noticed however that I hadn't included the ~.so libraries to the build path so I preceeded to add these two libraries to the build path as well. Which stopped the 323 errors but caused 2 new ones - Java Build Path Problems - Archive for required library: library in project cannot be read or is not a valid ZIP file. Am I doing something wrong by including the two ~.so files in the build path for the android project being developed using Eclipse?

This is actually a two-parter (let me know if I should split the question). I am using Intellij as an IDE. The build works completely fine if I run from that. When I use ant, however, things start to mess up. In the process of writing an automated test for my app, I have discovered two things: First, dexguard runs when I ant clean debug. Second, when I do this, I get the following error, but the build completes "successfully": [dexguard] Unexpected error while converting: [dexguard] Class = [com/framework/notification/NotificationDetailBuilder] [dexguard] Method = [getScheduledNotificationDetail()Lcom/framework/base/notification/NotificationDetail;] [dexguard] Exception = [java.lang.IllegalStateException] (Negative variable v-1 for instruction [iget v-1, v0, field_12165]) [dexguard] at com.saikoa.dexguard.fS.b(dexGuard:1219) etc. etc. So first off, what dumb thing did I do to get dexguard to run during debug. And Second, what in the world does this error even mean?

Outline: 1. My project uses LTI-CIVIL to capture webcam. 2. In Eclipse, everything works fine. 3. As LTI_CIVIL uses native libraries to access hardware, I have opted to use JarClassLoader (info found here http://www.jdotsoft.com/JarClassLoader.php#download) which allows for the native libraries to be unpacked into a temporary folder at runtime. Everything works great and I can even access the webcam capture stream until... I try to work with the Image handed in from the webcam which is of type com.lti.civil.NativeVideoFormat. The problem is that when run from the executable jar, it says that this class does not implement com.lti.civl.VideoFormat when it obviously does. I have even printed out the getClass() of the code running on eclipse and verified that the webcam Image is both of the same type. However, when I printout if the getClass() instanceof NativeVideoFormat, in the eclipse version this prints true, but in the jar version it prints false. Interestingly, this problem has appeared before, but with no solution: https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=10637883&#10637883 Thanks for your help
I have several entities spread in multiple jars. An entity located in jar X contains a collection of entities from jar Y. When I try to do static weaving on jar X I get the following error: Exception Description: [class MyEntity] uses a non-entity [class MyOtherEntity] as target entity in the relationship attribute [method getMyOtherEntities]. The error is related to the following stack: at org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.ValidationException.nonEntityTargetInRelationship(ValidationException.java:1360) at org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.metadata.accessors.mappings.RelationshipAccessor.getReferenceDescriptor(RelationshipAccessor.java:538) at org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.metadata.accessors.mappings.RelationshipAccessor.processJoinTable(RelationshipAccessor.java:692) at org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.metadata.accessors.mappings.ManyToManyAccessor.process(ManyToManyAccessor.java:160) at org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.metadata.MetadataProject.processOwningRelationshipAccessors(MetadataProject.java:1489) at org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.metadata.MetadataProject.processStage3(MetadataProject.java:1726) at org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.metadata.MetadataProcessor.processORMMetadata(MetadataProcessor.java:535) at org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.deployment.PersistenceUnitProcessor.processORMetadata(PersistenceUnitProcessor.java:550) at org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.EntityManagerSetupImpl.predeploy(EntityManagerSetupImpl.java:1469) Both entities are annotated with @Entity and worked fine with Hibernate. Both classes are in the classpath and I've checked in the debugger that MyOtherEntity is found and annotated as expected. Is it possible to use static weaving while the entities are spread in multiple jars?
I'm using hibernate to insert to a mysql table on which all columns are defined as not null. It has a unique primary key and another unique index on several columns. I'm getting the following error: org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: Could not execute JDBC batch update; SQL [insert into MY_TABLE(col1, col2, col3, col4, ID_) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)]; constraint [null] This error is in customer logs and I can't reproduce the problem myself, so I can't put in debugging to see what the values are in the insert statement. My understanding is that "constraint [null]" means a "not null" constraint is being violated. However, looking at my code, I cannot see any possible way that any of the data could be null at the time of the insert, unless hibernate is trying to insert a null ID (which would be a very bad bug in hibernate and so seems unlikely). However, I can see how it could happen that a unique constraint is being violated. Is it possible that the message is misleading and I'm actually getting a unique key violation? Does "constraint[null]" always mean a not null constraint was violated?
I am trying to device an algorithm that performs error correction in names. My approach is having a database with the correct names, compute edit distance between each of them and the name entered and then suggest the 5 or 10 closest. This task is significantly different from standard error correction in words as some of the names might be replaced by initials. For instance "Jonathan Smith" and "J. Smith" are actually quite close and could easily be considered the same name, so the edit distance should be really small if not 0. Another challenge is that some names might be written differently while sounding the same. For instance Shnaider and Schneider are versions of the same name written by people with different locales(there are better examples for that I guess). And another case - just imagine all the possible errors in writing Jawaharlal Nehru most of which have nothing to do with the real name. Again probably most of them will be similar phonetically. Obviously Lucene's error correction algorithm will not help me here as it does not handle the above cases. So my question is: do you know any library capable of doing error correction in names? Can you propose some algorithm for handling the cases mentioned above? I am interested in libraries in c++ or java. As for algorithm proposals any language or pseudo code will do.
I have exported a Talend (5.2.0) job as an autonomous job and deployed it to my production server (Windows 2008 R2 Standard 64bit). I have found the JVM and added it to the PATH environment variable of the server as it was not being found. The JVM in question is Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_05-b05) When I attempt to run the batch file I get the following error. Error: Could not find or load main class The automated process works correctly on my laptop (which also has Talend installed locally). The server does not have Talend installed. I didn't think that installing Talend on the server would be necessary if I exported the job as an autonomous one. Is there a setting that I need to implement to get this job to work? Edited to Add-- After further testing I've found that I had been testing with slightly different versions of the packaged job. The one that worked was generated from Talend 5.1.2 and the one that doesn't work came from Talend 5.2.0. This could be the cause of the problem. Another Edit--> Further investigation shows that 5.2.0 is generating jar files for the job classes that are only 1KB in size whereas with 5.1.2 the jar files are significantly bigger (around 128KB). I think this is probably a bug with Talend 5.2.0. I've raised it with Talend who are investigating.
Here are the steps that I have completed. Downloaded PDFRenderer.jar Created lib folder in my Eclipse Plug-In Project Copied the jar to the lib folder Right Click Build Path -> Configure Build Path Libraries Tab -> Add JARs -> Selected lib/PDFRenderder.jar file Runtime Tab in MANIFEST.MF Click Add -> Selected lib/PDFRenderder.jar Click New -> New Library Name -> entered . Built the Project - No Errors Right Click Project Export -> Deployable plug-ins and fragments -> Pick my plugin project name Copy exported Project plug-in to my Teamcenter/plug-ins dir When I run my plug-in project application, and try to access a command using a PDFRenderer command, I get following error. org.eclipse.core.runtime - org.eclipse.ui - 0 - Unhandled event loop exception java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/pdfview/PDFFile I know that it is not finding the PDFRenderer Library. But I am not sure why it is not finding the class? I am assuming that by adding the PDFRenderder.jar to the plug-in project Referenced library and adding that to the class path. It incorporates the PDFRenderder.jar in to my plug-in project jar file. I don't have to copy PDFRenderder.jar to Teamcenter/plug-ins dir as well? EDIT Please see below Java Build Path Binary Build Class Path Manifest Project Jar File Error Line 287 - PDFFile pdffile = new PDFFile(buf); Everything seems to be in place to me. But I must be missing something

There are many situations where I believe that chaining exceptions through several layers is a good idea; e.g. when a failure in calling out to some external service at the lowest layer causes problems all the way up in the view: Content X requested, but user isn't authorized caused by: List of authorized users is null caused by: User-management webservice responded Bad Request- Parameter foo must be formatted like 'xyz' The most important exception, the one whose stacktrace I really want to examine, is the last in the chain; that I made a bad request and I need to fix foo's formatting. But when I let this exception bubble up through the layers, nicely chained in exceptions that are meaningful to each layer... when I eventually catch and log the thing, the default logging behavior always shows me gobs of detail about the outermost exception, and maybe 5 lines of stacktrace of the root cause. This makes me want to log exceptions as they happen, AND let them bubble up, but then you end up logging most things twice; when they happen and when they are eventually caught. What is the best practice here?

I was using a user library in my program(Html Components). I decided to copy this library to a new location inside the project, so I would be able to copy my project to another computer. I've deleted the old library from the user library list. Now I'm trying to add the library from a new location. When I add the external jars from the new location and press OK, i get an error on the library. When I expend a jar, i get all my fields as none. I've tried to add another jar(that i haven't used before) from the same location and still have an error. When I'm adding the library from its original location, it works. Is there any limitation on the library path? What can be the problem? Now I've noticed that next to the jar file, next to the jar path, i get "(missing)" In addition, works when i add just external jars. Still doesn't work when i try to create a user library.
I'm looking into the idea of creating a new logger to hold log statements internally until an error occurs. So in the system I'm working on, it is a sequence process (no parallel work, with a set start point and end point). I'd like to have my info() lines buffered in memory & at the end if an error occurs, flush them out, or if its a success then don't bother logging them. I'm not too worried about memory use, its only 15 lines at a time (across several classes). But since it can process 100's of items a second(each creating 15 lines), the logging can become verbose with data that isn't that needed. The other option it to log to one main file, which can be tailed. Then if an error occurs, flush the last buffer to an ERROR log. Does anyone know of a SLF4J-LogWriter or LOG4J-Appender that does this already before I go creating my own? I can see http://sling.apache.org (org.apache.sling.scripting.core.impl.LogWriter) already does something similar, but will probably required me to hack the code out. Thanks Jeff Porter
First time post, long time watcher. Can't wait for my classmates to read this (they use the site too) I am using Eclipse Juno w/ Java SE 1.7 I am having an eclipse problem. It doesn't happen all the time, typically only during File IO. I'm using my debugger perspective in Eclipse to try and trouble shoot some problems (its really a simple program). UPDATE: Apparently new users are not allowed to upload screen shots. If you could take the time to click on the link to witness my problem I would appreciate it. Screen Shot Link (not java code): imgur.com/5IxI3.png As you can see I am getting an odd thread.class problem. I have even reinstalled java. Could it be something with my code as well then? Thanks for anyone who offers input or helps in anyway. I do have about a week before this is do so I'm not just looking for free answers, just frustrated. Thanks!
Because my RCP eclipse application fails when run outside of eclipse, but works correctly when running inside of eclipse, I am attempting to use eclipse to remotely debug my application as it's running outside of the eclipse environment. I am using 32 bit Eclipse 3.6.1 on a 64 bit Windows 7 machine. I am using 32 bit Java 1.6 update 37. I use the Eclipse Product export wizard to package the app, and I end up with an eclipse.exe. I have created a Remote Debug Configuration and set it to use port 8765 (random number). For debugging purposes, I start the app from the command line using this line: eclipse.exe -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=127.0.0.1:8765 Depending on whether I am attaching or listening via my Eclipse debugger, I will add the server=[y/n] option to this command line but it seems not to make any difference. For the configuration Connection Type I have tried both Standard (Socket Listen) and Standard (Socket Attach). When I try Socket Listen, my debugger will start listening - "Waiting for vm to connect at port 8765", but when I start my app through the command line, the app starts fine but the debugger never attaches. When I try Socket Attach, I start the app first using the command line, then when I attempt to attach using eclipse, I get the message "Failed to connect to remote VM. Connection refused" I've tried all the various combinations of address: localhost, 127.0.0.1, and my local IP address. I get the same result each time. Thanks for any help!
I am trying to launch an application (not Eclipse) that was written in Java. When I do, I get an error that says "Failed to Load the JNI shared Library (JDK)" along with a path that points to the location of the file. From searching Google and StackOverflow, all I can find are people saying that the Java version installed needs to match my machine. My machine is 64 bit and so is my java installation, so I don't think that is my issue. I have also verified that C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin is in my path variable. Also, just for the record, I do not use Eclipse. I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling Java an the application that was written in Java. Lastly, the file it is complaining about exists on the machine. Does anyone know what else could be the cause of this problem? Update: Thanks for your responses. I got it resolved, but the resolution seems like more of a hack and goes against what I was reading earlier. I installed the 32 bit version of Java 7 along side of my 64 bit version of Java 7. I then added the path the 32 bit version to the system path variable. After I did this, the application was able to launch. Is there an issue with having both 64 bit and 32 bit versions of Java 7 installed simultaneously?
When logging a wrapped exception, you usually get a long stacktrace about the wrapper, then a few lines of the actual root cause if there's room. But the root cause is the exception whose stacktrace I want to read! I am wrapping most exceptions in my app in custom exceptions that I control. (Reasoning for this in the background below.) To solve this logging problem, is it reasonable to have my custom wrapper exceptions simply delete most of their stacktrace upon construction? If I remove most of the stacktrace in my wrappers as they are constructed, everything is logged beautifully: log4j seems to print n lines of log about an exception and its causes, and truncating the stacktrace of my wrappers to 1 element makes room for plenty of stacktrace about the root cause. I can't think of any situation where I would want to know anything more than maybe the first line of trace, but something just bugs me about removing stacktrace information. I'm inexperienced, and I can't sort out if my intuition is right or if I'm just uncomfortable with an unusual situation. Can anyone tell me what might be wrong with this? Background if it's relevant: I am trying to figure out a reasonable first pass at decent errorhandling in a large java webapp. My current plan is to wrap exceptions in a custom exception when they occur, then let them bubble up to the top level where they are logged. (I would like to use my custom wrapper to attach a unique ID to every exception I see, so I can propagate that ID up to the UI and easily find the relevant logs even long after the fact.) This is a followup question closely related to When to log chained exceptions?, where I was worried about how to log chained exceptions so that I get more info about the actual cause than a bunch of useless stacktrace about subsequent wrappers. One of the suggestions-- not chaining through all the layers but letting exceptions bubble up to a top layer where I can control the logging -- is reasonable, and as long as they get to the top level it's easy to put code in one place to log the root cause, instead of the wrapper. But if I ever have cause to catch and log one of these exceptions, I'm stuck with the default logging behavior again.
I've recently learned about the -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError VM argument and was told that it should be added as a matter of course to the HotSpot JVM as it is off by default. One of my co-workers made a comment that maybe we shouldn't because he heard that there's some pitfall to doing this but he can't remember what it was. I hate vague statements like that, but am trying to do my due diligence before making a final decision so am doing some investigation. Most of the references to it I can find are more about how to use it (and where the dump files are located) and don't speak to any issues with using it. This SO question refers to a different argument, but the answers seem relevant to this one as well and imply that there are no issues: Why is this Hotspot JVM option not the default? -XX:+PrintConcurrentLocks Does anyone know of any reason not to turn -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError?
I am getting this error and tried almost everything I could think of. I even reinstalled Ubuntu, downloaded jdk 5 from Oracle and then installed maven2 and ant 1.8 but all in vain. I wrote a helloworld 'build.xmland ranant` on it, but I still get the error below. Just wondering if there is a hidden jar file that is not complied with the right version of compiler.

I have an assignment to design a simple spam filter using a hash table to store a set of "bad words." We discussed in class what a hash table is and how it's used (ie. how elements are inserted, linear probing, quadratic probing, chained probing, etc.), but we never really discussed how to use the Java API Hashtable, which is required for this assignment. anyway, I've tried my best to implement it, however, I'm getting an exception that I cannot seem to trace with my debugger. I've given up with inserting code here, I always have to spend time formatting it properly and it still doesn't look good. So I'm putting it on Pastebin instead. It should make your lives easier too since it does syntax highlighting and line counting as well. SpamFilter class SpamFilterDriver class I get NullPointerExceptions at the following lines in the SpamFilterDriver class: line 78 line 96 line 115 Any help would be appreciated. I'm sure it's probably something silly, but I'm just not seeing it at the moment. Also, please note that the code is not finished yet in the least. The fact that the SpamFilter implements Serializeable will be used later on. Also, there are some empty methods, again, they will be implemented later, I just need to solve this problem first.
I am running tomcat 6, 64 bit on a Windows 7 64 bit platform. I copied my web application (entire folder - it is called cuba4remedy) to a tomcat 6 64 bit installation on a different machine. this one running Windows 2008 standard 64 bit. The servlet was working fine on my Windows 7 development machine but when I run on the new machine I see this error in the Catalinaxxx.log :- SEVERE: Null component Catalina:type=JspMonitor,name=jsp,WebModule=//localhost/myappnamehere,J2EEApplication=none,J2EEServer=none I don't really understand why I am getting this error. Any ideas anyone? One more point might be relevant. I compiled on my dev machine using Javac version 1.7. On the machine I copied to only the Java runtime is installed - that is Java version 1.6. EDIT For anyone else facing this problem, it seems that dev version of Java must be either same or lower version than deployment. I downgraded my dev java version to same as target runtime version and then this error went away. Can anyone confirm this?
My Android application (minSdkLevel: 2.2, targetSdkLevel: 3.0, testing on Nexus 7 with Android 4.2) does the following in the loading phase: Creates a SoundPool and registers an OnLoadCompleteListener on it Starts loading sounds. SoundPool calls my callback method whenever a sound is loaded. If the loading process is interrupted by user, SoundPool.release() is called (If release() was already called and a previously started sound loading completes, i.e. the system calls my callback, then my application detects that that my SoundPool is already null and ignores the callback, so it is safe). Testing on a Nexus 7, the following error occured at 210ms after SoundPool.release() was called (logcat): I.e. the event order was the following probably: The system started to load sounds asynchronously due to my SoundPool.load(...) calls I left the loading screen, so SoundPool.release() was called and SoundPool set to null (?) The system completed an earlier sound loading completion callback, but encountered some error. I checked the Android source code and the JNI code for SoundPool.release() indeed deletes the SoundPool in JNI via DeleteGlobalRef. It uses a weak reference to store the SoundPool reference on Java level. I cannot reproduce the bug, probably because I can't reproduce the exact conditions due to nondeterminism. The system should correctly handle that a SoundPool might be released while it loads sounds asynchronously, but it seems under some rare circumstances, a bug appears. (Note that my code releases SoundPool exactly once after a nullcheck, so the error is not in my code for sure). Any idea about why exactly does such an error occur in Android? Can my above suspicions be correct, in theory? How can I protect my application against this Android bug? Maybe I can try setting in a boolean that the SoundPool should be released, wait until all callbacks returned, and then release it (based on this boolean) in the last callback? I can't think of any other workaround, but I would like to be sure that it will work, at least.
I had an issue where I was getting the following error in the Problems view when attempting to save/compile a Java script library in a DB held on a server. I'm using DDE 8.5.3 (Note, I've changed the app and the lib names): Project 'app_name.nsf.java-lib-name.javalib' is missing required library: 'C:\lotus\notes8\jvm\lib\axis\axis.jar' It's worth noting that I'm using the Eclipse based Java editor, this issue doesn't happen if I use the traditional editor. My script library had a number of JAR files associated, however none of them were included via the path which appeared to be causing the issue. Also it couldn't have been some deeply concealed dependency thing as all of the included JARs are custom built and none of them user or require Axis. I also did a test creating a fresh library without pulling any external JARs in and the same error occurred. It turns out the problem was being caused by the use of "JavaUserClassesExt" in my local notes.ini. I've recently been using a LN client app which depends on Axis and part of the install process includes dropping the relevant Axis files into a custom directory within jvm/lib/ext and then updating the ini to include those files using "JavaUserClassesExt" when launching the JVM. I guess the issue has only shown up now because I've recently had to change the location of my LN install from the path indicated above (lotus\notes8) to something slightly different (lotus\notes853). I copied my ini across from the original install location which is why it still references the old path. Once I removed the references to the wrong path, the error cleared up. So I can kind of understand what is happening, the JVM is attempting to load all required files on the classpath but is running into an issue because the files being requested via "JavaUserClassesExt" can no longer be found. What I don't understand is why it's throwing this error when I'm attempting to edit a script library in a completely different database which has nothing to do with the Axis framework. I'd expect a compile error if trying to import anything to do with Axis based on it being on my local classpath, but to throw this error when the library has nothing to do with Axis seems confusing and incorrect to me. As I mentioned, this only happens when using the Eclipse based Java editor so I presume this is a bug with that version of the editor. Has anyone come across anything similar? Would this be classed as expected behaviour or can anyone confirm if this is a bug? I realise this is a pretty edge case issue but would be interested in any insight. Cheers, Lee
Full text of log message: Log Message: An error occurred while grabbing new users com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: The last packet successfully received from the server was 44,567,434 milliseconds ago. The last packet sent successfully to the server was 44,567,434 milliseconds ago. is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem. This is strange to me because that is over 10 hours. My program was happily and successfully running, including communicating with the database, over the previous 10 hours. The best hypothesis I have is that a single connection in the pool was stale but in that case I don't know why this wouldn't be cleaned up automatically or if this exception was related to that operation. How should I handle this? Am using c3p0 connection pool.
I'm using Mojarra, Primefaces 3.4 and JSF 2.1 along with JPA/Hibernate for persistence. The problem is best described as having a bean and a view along with a custom validator, where I enter a number into a field which has a validator. The validator checks up the field value in a DB through the backend and prevents duplicate objects from being created. The validation prevents duplicate objects from being submitted on the first submission in all cases. However, there are several times when it will just allow a subsequent (second) submission to go through and be persisted (albeit with a null value for this particular field having the validator) even though there is a invalidation failure from the first submission. I'm unable to understand why this is happening, but suspecting something related to scopes. I've tried CDI's @ConversationScoped and @RequestScoped, as well as MyFaces CODI @ViewAccessScoped. @RequestScoped seems to "solve" this problem but has some other issues, i.e. it cannot be persisted at all after the first invalidation due to (probably) the values not being retained after the first submission. Additionally, there is an AJAX call on the identifier which will attempt to retrieve customer data from another system. In case it succeeds, all other fields should be readonly which is handled through a boolean set during the customer data retrieval process. @RequestScoped cannot handle this as the value gets "lost" after the first submission. The entire code is quite extensive, please let me know in case there is any specific part of it you would like to see in order to reply to this question. Clarification in step-by-step manner: Navigate to page. Attempt to create duplicate object by using existing unique identifier and submission. Form along with custom validator error is shown. Second attempt to submit the same page (without reloading the page). Page is successfully submitted and persisted, but the unique identifier is NOT submitted and has null value in the DB. This does NOT happen every time, which is the confusing part. However it happens in maybe 50% of cases with no pattern that I could detect.
I have been reading the JLS and I encountered the section 11.1.3. Asynchronous Exceptions from which I quote: Most exceptions occur synchronously as a result of an action by the thread in which they occur, and at a point in the program that is specified to possibly result in such an exception. An asynchronous exception is, by contrast, an exception that can potentially occur at any point in the execution of a program. And Asynchronous exceptions occur only as a result of: [...] An internal error or resource limitation in the Java virtual machine that prevents it from implementing the semantics of the Java programming language. In this case, the asynchronous exception that is thrown is an instance of a subclass of VirtualMachineError. Is it possible to catch such exceptions for logging purposes or notification (because I believe such thing is unrecoverable)? How can I achieve such thing?
I'm building an Android app in ADT v21.0.0. This application needs to use a protobuf library I've compiled into a jar. By putting this jar as well as protobuf-java-2.4.1.jar in my libs/ folder, Eclipse recognizes it at build time, however whenever I attempt to run the application in my Android emulator, I get a NoClassDefFoundError exception when attempting to instantiate one of my auto-generated custom classes produced by the protobuf compiler. I've seen a lot of tips regarding the naming of the libs/ folder (apparently a prior ADT update broke this by requiring the /lib folder to be /libs), as well as adding .jars explicitly from the "Java Build Path" settings window (and checking the jars in the Order and Export pane). None of these have helped, however, and I'm wondering if there's something more fundamental preventing my protobuf classes from being recognized at runtime. Note: if I create a standard Java application in Eclipse, I am able to use my proto classes just fine. This is only an issue when running the Android application.
I'm attempting to import the spring-mvc-showcase project from the list of example projects on the STS start page.

I have a problem that I can't figure out. Context : was 7.0.0.19 version (with no preCompileJsp) Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/jsp/_xxx (wrong name: com/ibm/_jsp/_xxx) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassImpl(Native Method) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:275) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:212) at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionClassLoader.defClass(JSPExtensionClassLoader.java:181) at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionClassLoader._loadClass(JSPExtensionClassLoader.java:133) It's the only JSP that give problem, and only on a specific environment (no problem on the others environments with the same configuration) the xxx.class is well present in my profile/tmp directory with others jsp in the same directory (that all give no problem) and the filesystem is not full. Tests I did a copy of xxx.jsp to xxxNew.jsp in the same directory I can access the xxxNew.jsp without any problem (so there is no coding problem) So I did a mv from xxx.jsp to xxx1.jsp and had no problem to access the jsp new named I deleted the xxx.class in the tmp directory I did the mv back to the first name (xxx.jsp) and still get the error with a newly xxx.class in the tmp directory. Is there a class cache anywhere in websphere that could explain this ? (no cachespec.xml for dynacache found in the war module). Why Websphere try to find a class from the org.apache.jsp package and not from com.ibm._jsp ? (how the AS choose the mapping from the URL to the classes ?) Thxs !
This is a longshot question, so bear with me. :) I like to have my code warning free so that I can quickly determine if I have a warning that truly needs to be dealt with. I have it set that if certain javadoc items are not correct, it will display a warning. In the team I work with, they are not concerned with javadoc warnings in the unit tests. These tests are always at src/test/java. Unfortunately if there is a warning in the test, it not only shows the warning icon on the code folder src/test/java, but also on the project itself. I'm tempted just to javadoc all of their unit tests, but it's not a good use of my time. Is there a way to tell eclipse to ignore warnings from src/test/java or trigger different warnings for my tests than for my implementation?
My Java program crashes (in Eclipse) when I load in a fairly large file. I have run VisualVM and my CPU seems to peak at 20% usage before crashing and my heap size doesn't seem too high. The number of threads running at the time of crash is ~20. I do receive error messages - but not every time the crash occurs. The two error messages I receive are: [Too many errors, abort] and # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: # # SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f096d096942, pid=12102, tid=139678234564352 # # JRE version: 6.0_24-b24 # Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (20.0-b12 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops) # Derivative: IcedTea6 1.11.5 # Distribution: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, package 6b24-1.11.5-0ubuntu1~12.04.1 # Problematic frame: # J java.util.HashMap.put(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object; I have found a thread pertaining to the second warning, but it seems to suggest a hardware issue.

Our application has the following layers and interaction: View (JSP) -> Ajax calls -> MyController (implements Spring Controller) -> through a custom service lookup -> MyService (implements Base Service) -> My DAOimpl Our idea is to use AOP for logging exceptions. To keep the AOP intercepts simple, we decided to define the cuts on the Controllers. The Controllers have a few methods like onLoad, onUpdate (related to CRUD ops) which are called from the handleRequest method, and we would like to define these methods for the poitncut. Ie., any exception at the Service layer or below, will bubble up and will reach the Controllers. AOP pointcut defined to intercept the throws exception and log the exception details into a log. Subsequently, an error code will be sent back to the view where the error message will be displayed appropriately. Issues: - AOP does not intercept the calls to the onLoad, etc methods. We understand that this is because calls to these methods from handleRequest are treated as self calls on the Controller and hence AOP does not intercept them. - To circumvent the issue above, we created an interface with onLoad, onUpdate methods and a set of util classes that implement the onLoad, etc methods. The Controllers will have these utils as members. Pointcuts will be defined on these utils instead of the Controllers. When doing this, AOP works only if the AOP config is present in the spring-servlet xml and not in a custom xml for AOP declaration. This observation is only for Controllers. If the AOP cuts are defined on Service layer, then the declarations work as expected (in a custom xml). We are not sure of the dependency between spring servlet xml and the cuts on Controllers. Suggestions required: - Should we have AOP defined for Controllers at all? Should this be defined only at Service layer? At the Controllers, the exceptions will be ‘caught’ and the error message will be sent to view appropriately. Wanted to check if there are any fundamental issues in the original approach.
When an uncaught exception is thrown in my code, I am used to having the debugger stop at the throwing statement so that I can examine the local variables and the members of all objects involved at the moment that the exception was thrown. With IntelliJ Idea this can be accomplished by going to Run, View Breakpoints, selecting the Exception Breakpoints tab, checking Any exception, and making sure that the Caught exception checkbox is unchecked, while the Uncaught exception checkbox is checked. With Eclipse and with Visual Studio (for C#) it is something different, but along the same lines. The ability to have the debugger behave this way is extremely useful; so useful in fact, that I structure the main loop of my programs accordingly: on the release version, the main loop is of course embedded inside a try-catch-all; but on the debug version, there is no try-catch block in the main loop, so that any exceptions that are not caught anywhere within my program will remain uncaught, so that the debugger will suspend my program at the moment that they are thrown. When testing my Java classes with JUnit, however, I have a problem: the debugger does not stop on any exception. Instead, what happens is that not only expected, but also unexpected exceptions get automagically caught, and I am given a post-mortem exception stack trace to try and make sense out of. That's not very cool. I used to think that this is happening because JUnit makes use of java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(), which catches all exceptions and transforms them to TargetInvocationExceptions, but then I wrote my own custom JUnit runner, which knows my test class personally and directly invokes its methods without Method.invoke(), and the problem persists. This means that the problem lies high up within core JUnit. So, does anyone else have the same problem? Does anyone know of a solution so that we can have the debugger suspend program execution on unexpected exceptions while testing with JUnit? Related (unanswered) question: Suspend on uncaught runtime exceptions in Eclipse Junit test runner Related (unanswered) question: How to break into debugger within a jUnit test case? Related (partly answered) question: Break on Exception in Eclipse using jUnit (The accepted answer says that "if you debug a single method in jUnit, the breakpoints start to work. If an entire class or package is debugged in jUnit, the debugger doesn't work.")

Our application is highly concurrent. It is taking MQ data and saving it to a database. There are multiple messages that might contain the same data. So one message might contain operating hours and the second message might contain operating hours and location. So the first message comes through and I save the operating hours data. Then the second transaction comes in with the same exact data for operating hours. Now I need the location data to be saved, but the operating hours is a duplicate. I can't make a check for operating hours on the database because of concurrency (If I check, it might so it is not existing, then by the time I save it, it might have been inserted by another thread). I also want to be fast. (lots of load on this loader.) Currently a message gets one Transaction (Propagation.REQUIRED) (using Spring and Hibernate). I do a flush after each kind of data insert. So I save the location data, and do a flush. then I save the operating hours and flush. If I just catch the error message (it is thrown after the flush()) and eat it, will the other data saved (the location data) still be saved? Is the Transaction still OK to use after a database insert failure? So if the first save failed, I want the second insert to work. I have been looking at Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW but have had some trouble. Also, I am concerned about slowing this down. I would need 3 transactions (there is a bit of logic before all this.) Most of the info on the we talks about Rollbacks, but I don't want to rollback. I just want to move on. Can I?

Yesterday evening I upgrade to ADT-21 and restarted eclipse. Then eclipse said that you need to update android tool to version 21. I downloaded window_installer21 and install it in the same location where my previous window_installer was installed. So it overwrite the file. Then I restarted eclipse and suddenly all project stop working. Eclipse always open with the error. SecurityException: Unable to find field for dex.jar And when i try to launch a project it stops with the below error Unknown error: Unable to build: the file dx.jar was not loaded from the SDK folder! SDK Manager is also not opening. I have tried: Clearing all project Re stared eclipse and computer about 20-30 timmes Uninstall Android SDk, JAVA and reinstalled it Setting the path of find_java.bat file Searched 6 hour over internet and read some form This, this.and this one also. Nothing seems to work.
In a project, the developer used HttpServletResponse.setContentTYpe(), followed by HttpServletResponse.setCharacterEncoding(); There was a compilation error at the deployment setup due to response.setCharacterEncoding. It was quite apparent that the HttpServletResponse class was missing, yet to double check I did lots of research and figured out that the most plausible reason could be that servlet-api.jar and jsp-api.jar are not getting included in the classpath during build process. I got it checked at developer end also, yet the error was still there. So I asked on of the guys who is a veteran in the process, and the cause that he put up was that the error was due to HttpServletResponse.setContentTYpe(), followed by HttpServletResponse.setCharacterEncoding(), and after replacing the two lines with HttpServletResponse.setContentType("application/json;UTF8") its working fine. I again went through the javadocs to see if it's possible, but I didnt got any such logic. Can anyone tell me if its possible that these two methods can cause compilation error. Or do I need to start learning Java from Complete Reference.

I am using Java, Selenium-WebDriver (2.25) , Maven, JUnit to Develop tests for one of the website. The tests are working fine for [Firefox and Chrome]. The same tests are not working for IE. Scenario: User registers to a page, get redirected from Domain A to Domain B. Domain B is Basic Authenticated. I am handling it using autoIT[as I do have to run them in windows env. only]. Flow : Register Click i.e. submit the form it will go to the next page. will ask for username and password. Before autoit can work it gives the exception of unhandled alert. I hope someone can help me. It is giving me exception i.e. "org.openqa.selenium.UnhandledAlertException: Modal dialog present" The problem I think is I am not handling the alert, but why only in IE it is recognized as part of the page, not in FF and Chrome [for them autoIT solution is working perfectly].
I am trying to deploy a dynamic web project in a way that allows me to dynamically add Quartz jobs to the classpath. Here is my thinking. 'If I read configuration from an XML file containing a fully qualified classpath, then use Class.forName() in the class to create an instance of said class from the config XML, then I should be able to access dynamically added classes placed in Tomcats TOMCAT_HOME/lib directory'. Before this update, the application worked fine, but I had these newly externalized classes contained in the war. However, I can no longer do this because I: Don't want to redeploy the war every time a new job is required. Cannot take the server down to add new jobs as there are jobs that need to run continuously. However, I am getting a NoClassDefFoundError when I run the class.forName() method. I have already verified in catalina.properties that the lib directory in Tomcat is in the common.loader property. My question is, how can I get my WAR classes to recognize the classes in a jar in the Tomcat common library. Any ideas? Thanks. addition: @BalusC: I have actually already developed a web based admin screen which allows the user to edit the XML config file to add new jobs. However, to add not just another instance of a job, but an entirely new job, there needs to be code definition of this new job. I want that to be placed into a jar file to be dropped into the tomcat lib directory to be picked up by class.forName().
I can't launch my Android app (which was working fine before I upgraded the version of Worklight that I'm using) and it keeps giving the error of sun/security/x509/X500Name. Now, I've setup Android many times with Sun's Java, so I'm absolutely baffled. Here's how I've got it setup: Project >> Properties >> Java Build Path >> Libraries >> Add Library - This is where I have put my Sun Java. Window >> Preferences >> Java >> Installed JREs - My Sun Java is ticked and is the default one. I've even edited my eclipse.ini but with or without the following line it makes no difference: -vm C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_27\bin\javaw.exe I seem to remember something about I couldn't have spaces, is that true? If so, how do I replace the spaces? Even still, it should work within my Eclipse application without the need for defined my VM in this manner (or so I believe). I'm not aware of anywhere else I need to define the Java I'm using. If I've missed anything please let me know. Thanks!

So I'm writing a compiler in Java using ANTLR, and I'm a little puzzled by how it deals with errors. The default behavior seems to be to print an error message and then attempt, by means of token insertion and such, to recover from the error and continue parsing. I like this in principle; it means that (in the best case) if the user has committed more than one syntax error, they'll get one message per error, but it'll mention all the errors instead of forcing them to recompile to discover the next one. The default error message is fine for my purposes. The trouble comes when it's done reading all the tokens. I am, of course, using ANTLR's tree constructors to build abstract syntax trees. While it's nice for the parse to continue through syntax errors so the user can see all the errors, once it's done parsing I want to get an exception or some kind of indication that the input wasn't syntactically valid; that way I can stop the compilation and tell the user "sorry, fix your syntax errors and then try again". What I don't want is for it to spit out an incomplete AST based on what it thinks the user was trying to say, and continue to the next phase of compilation with no indication that anything went wrong (other than the error messages which went to the console and I can't see). Yet by default, it does exactly that. The Definitive ANTLR Reference offers a technique to stop parsing as soon as a syntax error is detected: override the mismatch and recoverFromMismatchedSet methods to throw RecognitionExceptions, and add a @rulecatch action to do the same. This would seem to lose the benefit of recovering from parse errors, but more importantly, it only partially works. If a necessary token is missing (for instance, if a binary operator only has an expression on one side of it), it throws an exception just as expected, but if an extraneous token is added, ANTLR inserts the token that it thinks belongs there and continues on its merry way, producing an AST with no indication of a syntax error except a console message. (To make matters worse, the token it inserted was EOF, so the rest of the file didn't even get parsed.) I'm sure I could fix this by, say, adding something like an isValid field to the parser and overriding methods and adding actions so that, at the end of the parse, it throws an exception if there were any errors. But is there a better way? I can't imagine that what I'm trying to do is unusual among ANTLR users.

What is the Java equivalent of a Linux coredump or Windows minidump? I've read about heap dumps and it looks like what I want, but how to trigger them (automatically) on uncaught exceptions? I know about the uncaught exception handler and I'm already using it to print the exception + stack trace and terminate the whole application (otherwise the thread dies and the application keeps running? huh?) Also I found this post about how to record heap dumps from code, but if I do that from the unhandled exception handler Java already has caught the exception and the stack trace (and arguments) are gone. I came across the -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError flag which seems to do what I need, unfortunately only for out of memory exceptions and not for other uncaught exceptions. That's the only things I've been able to get out of google so far. Currently I'm using an attached debugger with exception breakpoints, but that is impractical because it also breaks on handled exceptions, so it can't be used unsupervised. [update on motivation] I want to be able to examine the arguments and local variables of the stack trace to figure out what caused the exception. Its usually null reference exceptions or assertions that fail, and I cannot always guess from the line number what exactly went wrong. In C/C++ I'm used to crash with a coredump/minidump and then examine further what has actually led to the crash.
I have two JSF controllers and three backing beans which are sharing a CDI conversation. After the first controller is invoked, a call is made to a non-JSF web application to log the user on (OpenAM/OpenSSO) and then the second controller is invoked. The conversation id is retained by appending '?cid=1234' to the page request for the second controller. My controllers are annotated as follows: @Named (javax.inject.Named) @ConversationScoped (javax.enterprise.context.ConversationScoped) and has the controller injected as follows: @Inject (javax.inject.Inject) private transient Conversation conversation; (javax.enterprise.context.Conversation) The backing beans are annotated as follows: @Named (javax.inject.Named) This is being run on JBoss 7.1, which uses Weld for CDI. This was working fine, but after making some unrelated changes it is not longer working. The problem now is that when the first controller is invoked, and I call conversation.begin(), the conversation id I have returned is always 1. Furthermore when I come back to the second controller, I get the following error: org.jboss.weld.context.NonexistentConversationException: WELD-000321 No conversation found to restore for id 1 I have tried accessing the web app multiple times with new sessions, and I have tried accessing it from different tabs, and from different browsers. The conversation id '1' is always returned. Also, as far as I am aware, I am not killing the session or conversation at any time between the two controller calls.
Hi so I am working through this book called Beginning Android Games because and I am having some problems with the Android 1.5 Android Virtual Device. First the SDK for Eclipse (the program I am using) didnt have the 1.5 SDK for Android so I had it installed when you first try to run a AVD it asks has a checklist of SDK's that will be fetched and installed for you if you check the box. I did this, had the 1.5 SDK installed however when i try to run a AVD emulator using the 1.5 sdk i get a (Failed to allocate memory: 8 This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. please contact the application's support team for more information.) type of error. But when I used the default 4.2 SDK for an AVD emulator the emulator showed up. I dont get what im doing wrong here. Also in eclipse i have the Android ADT and SDK installed. In eclipse when i click on window then Android virtual device manager and I try to start a new emulator the 1.5 sdk i installed doesnt show. But when I click on window->sdk manager->tools->manage avds then my 1.5 sdk shows up and I can use it.
I am running the 64-bit install of IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD) 8.0.4 on Windows 7. I have WebSphere Application Server (WAS) v6.1 running within it. To be honest, I'm not completely sure if the WAS server is 32- or 64-bit. My problems are: Except for a few useless lines of logging at WAS startup, I get no logging in the RAD console at all. Not even when there's an exception thrown-- no strack trace, nothing. I cannot find the SystemOut.log file in the place that the WebSphere Properties dialog claims that it is. However, there is one in C:\Users\myUser\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\IBM\SDP\runtimes\base_v61\profiles\was61profile1\logs\server1\SystemOut.log, but I do not know how to configure RAD/Eclipse to see it. I do see an Access is Denied message as the first line of what I can see in the Console. But RAD is not clear about what or whom is being denied access, and in all other ways the server works just fine, except... I cannot seem to get the WAS instance to run in Debug mode. If I "Restart in Debug...", RAD complies, but the server in the Servers panel of Eclipse does not show "Degugging, Synchronized"-- it simply shows "Started, Synchronized"-- just like it would if started normally. The Debug panel in Eclipse shows the server there, and claims that the debugger is listening on Port 8001. But the application will not stop on any breakpoints. My colleagues are running identical Windows 7 machines, but have the 32-bit RAD 8.0.4, and don't seem to have this problem. I'm not ready to concede and re-install RAD down to 32-bit, nor do I have the time. There's got to be some other solution.
I have created a simple application using the Google App Engine Environment Eclipse 4.2 (Juno) Plugin - http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/4.2 JDK 7 I was able to create a sample application and run it locally.

When using VisualVM for cpu-profiling of my application, I run into the error "Profiler Agent Error: with message: Redefinition failed with error 66". Upon that, it copies all the class-files from the build path to the location I've started the application from. I tried to find some information on it, the error code means (According to JVMTI-documentation): JVMTI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_REDEFINITION_HIERARCHY_CHANGED (66) A direct superclass is different for the new class version, or the set of directly implemented interfaces is different. As profiling usually works in my environment (Java build 1.7.0_09-b05, Fedora 17 64-bit). I've tried "-Xshare:off" as said in the Visualvm-docs, without any effect. As this is the only Java-SE application I'm experiencing this problem with, it seems that it is somehow related to the libraries I'm using. The following are in my classpath: Log4j 1.2.17 Apache OpenJPA 2.2.1 Commons Configuration 1.9 Commons Pool 1.6 Postgresql 9.1-901jdbc4 imgscalr-lib-4.2 Can anyone see a correlation between the libraries and the error? I really don't have an idea anymore.
I have a server application which, somewhat simplified, periodically takes measurements via a rest-api from a not beefy-enough-server. The values should be cached locally (and are timestamped/immutable), maybe stored as a FloatBuffer where every position corresponds to a measurement sample. There's a webbrowser application which periodically makes ajax requests to update some neat statistics on the webpage, like this picture: Assuming that the server is up and running, there are still many places where errors could occur The REST measurement server could be unreachable (where the server just keeps storing measurements locally) The network connection to the measurement server could be down The storage could be full or somehow corrupt The Browser could lose contact with the server and try to take it up again My strategy for coping with errors in general should be the following: If there are problems getting values from the measurement service via REST, there should be retries every minute. If the error persists for more than 30 minutes consequtively the administrator should be notified. In case of disk problems the administratior should be notified at once, or preferably even before the disk goes full. The end user experience should be as transparent to the errors as possible, but the application should still function as sanely as possible, by notifying the user an error have occured but also show the latest data availiable. How do I find which errors to cope with regarding network problems (using clj-http via an agent triggered by a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor job to make REST request) and regarding problems with disk when trying to flush the FloatBuffer? What is a sane way to implement the quite stateful yet algorithmic strategy mentioned above? Should I simply handle the error when the agent reports it and switch to some kind of a recovery-mode job?
I have a Java EE 5 application which consists of three web projects. I'm using JBoss 5.1 web server and NetBeans 7.2 IDE. I have the following problems: I cannot start application in Debug mode. That I know of, there are two (best) approaches in NetBeans and Java: Remote debugging and debugging via shared memory. I read this post How to debug JBOSS application in netbeans? and I set debug parameters in Jboss configuration(I also know there are different parameter sets for shared memory and remote debugging), but when I go to attach debugger I got following errors: If I use remote debugging I got error "Connection refused"; If I use shared memory I got error similar to this text "dt_shmem:file path could not be found". These errors occur when I start JBoss by running run.bat file. If I start JBoss from Netbeans IDE, I can attach to remote process (still have problem with shared memory approach), but then I have other problems, regarding variable primitives and model binding in page life cycle (I will not write about that now). How can I solve these problems so I can debug application? At least, how can I find a better error message when it fails. I could not find too much on the Net by looking for "Connection refused" error only. Why I cannot just press run main project(or web project) and that netbeans start application, open it in new browser tab(as localhost) and start debug mode? I'm coming from .net background and VS is offering this as out of the box tool (called ASP .NET development server). Why I have to use external web server and with every change deploy new application and then attach to it? Why Netbeans cannot by default use JVM for running application, and later when I deploy application I will choose which web server to use!? I hope someone will make this clear to me :) Thanks added Note at 03.01.2013. Well, when I changed VM options in project.properties file of web project (added run.args.extra=-J-Xms256m -J-Xmx756m), I succeeded to debug application and heat breakpoint when executing the code. However, I still have strange problem with Managed Bean properties. I have select list on page, and it is connected to Boolean property. When nothing is selected it should be set to null value by default (and it is when I start JBoss server by running run.bat file), but its value is by default set to false! I checked parameters post values in firebug and there is no problem in posting parameters to bean. It looks to me that problem is when JSF framework is trying to map post values to Managed Beans properties, but I cannot find out why this is happening. I also checked faces-config.xml, but did not find any specific rule for mapping to this specific property. Any tips?
We have a 64 bit JBoss instance that deploys an axis web service, which is just the front end face to run a native executable command. When the web service is called, it executes this native executable command. The 64 bit instance runs with 3gb of memory. We recently introduced a 2nd instance of JBoss running on the same physical machine. It runs in 32 bit mode, because it has to run some JNI 32 bit code. This second instance of JBoss is bound to ports-01 so that it runs on 8180 (basically +100 of the default JBoss ports). This instance runs with 512MB of memory. Since introducing this second instance of JBoss, we are receiving "not enough space" error messages when the 64 bit instance tries to execute the native executable command when it is called. It's an IOException from java, from the unix forkAndExec command. Everything I read, says this has something to do with swap file size. Using the unix, top command, it looks like the swap file size never changes, and it is 3gb. When we run the 64 bit instance first, there seem to be no issues with this, but if the 32 bit instance starts first, we get this error. I'm wondering if the two instances are competing for resources, or if we really are running out of swap space from unix. I'm not sure if JBoss uses swap space and how much it uses, or does Java handle that? I guess I'm looking for any ideas or suggestions for a solution about this problem. The main pattern I seem to see is that if the 64 bit instance starts first, the native executable works fine, but if the 32 bit instance starts first, it has issues.
I have been trying to run one simple example to check Weka GUI interface as I am planning to develop Support Vector Machine(SVM) using Weka API/WLSVM in my Java code. There are three steps I am following to make arff from text datasets (Training & Testing). You can assistant me to run it in Java code. text file to .arff file converter. Applied StringToWordVector Filter. Applied Batch Filter on training and test datasets. 1. text file to .arff file converter. This step works fine on Simple CLI using following command Error: java weka.core.converters.TextDirectoryLoader -dir Testing_Text > Testing.arff but when I run it on MAC bash it gives following error, how can I resolve this issue? Could not find or load main class weka.core.converters.TextDirectoryLoader 2. Applied StringToWordVector Filter I applied this filter using Weka GUI Interface separately first training and then on testing datasets. 3. Applied Batch Filter on training and testing dataset. When I try to apply batch filter it gives error: Input file formats differ on Simple CLI using following command. java weka.filters.unsupervised.attribute.Standardize -b -i Training_STWV.arff -o train_std.arff -r TestingDiff_STWV.arff -s test_std.arff Input file formats differ. Kindly guide me, I am stuck to run Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier using Weka.
I am encountering a Connection reset by peer: socket write error while trying to invoke a .Net web service. Scenario: I have a web service client (created from Java using Eclipse) that consumes a .Net web service (created from C#) and is deployed on a IIS web server. What the client does is it reads the content of a file as binary and turn it into a String input (let's call it binaryContentInput). Now, this binaryContentInput will be used as an input when invoking the .Net web service. Findings: When the file is 3 Mb and below, my code is working fine. But when the file is 4Mb and above, my code is encountering the socket write error. Output from Eclipse when encountered the error: http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=50e68c5986083 Encoding/Decoding code found on the internet: http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=50e68ce6c31b3 General Objective: To transfer a file from one server to another (they are both inside the same firewall) I've tried googling around based on the error but I haven't found any working solution yet. Can somebody lend a hand? Thanks.
How to communicate user defined objects and user defined (checked) exceptions between Service and UI in JavaFX2? The examples only show String being sent in to the Service as a property and array of observable Strings being sent back to the UI. Properties seem to be defined only for simple types. StringProperty, IntegerProperty, DoubleProperty etc. Currently I have a user defined object (not a simple type), that I want Task to operate upon and update with the output data it produced. I am sending it through the constructor of Service which passes it on through the constructor of Task. I wondered about the stricture that parameters must be passed in via properties. Also if an exception is thrown during Task's operation, How would it be passed from Service to the UI? I see only a getException() method, no traditional throw/catch. Properties http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/binding/jfxpub-binding.htm Service and Task http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/threads/jfxpub-threads.htm Service javadocs http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/concurrent/Service.html#getException() "Because the Task is designed for use with JavaFX GUI applications, it ensures that every change to its public properties, as well as change notifications for state, errors, and for event handlers, all occur on the main JavaFX application thread. Accessing these properties from a background thread (including the call() method) will result in runtime exceptions being raised. It is strongly encouraged that all Tasks be initialized with immutable state upon which the Task will operate. This should be done by providing a Task constructor which takes the parameters necessary for execution of the Task. Immutable state makes it easy and safe to use from any thread and ensures correctness in the presence of multiple threads." But if my UI only touches the object after Task is done, then it should be ok, right?
Recently, I started to use reverse debugging with gdb in C++ and it works pretty well for certain types of problems (e.g., loops and recursive algorithms). Besides gdb, there are other commercial debuggers for C/C++ (e.g., UndoDB). I wonder if there are good reversible debuggers for other languages? I'm especially interested in Java and Ruby but the question is open to any language. An alternative that I found is to run your application on a virtual machine and connect to it. The only implementation that I know of (but never tested) is VMware's Replay Debugging. I wonder for which types of debugging tasks it is suitable. Seems to be overkill for most common problems but it may be useful to debug communication or synchronization issues, which are generally hard to reproduce. Background information: The term "Reverse Debugging" is used by gdb. However, there are many synonyms: "Reversible Debugging" Microsoft calls it IntelliTrace or "Historical Debugging" In Java, such debuggers are sometimes known as an "Ominiscient Debugger" (on programmers.stackexchange) Why is reverse debugging rarely used?

I'm making program in Java, which connects to MySQL database. As first class was class with single static method returning java.sql.Connection. After it was debugged and connection was working I never touch it again. And few days ago I discovered my program was returning this error: com.mysql.jdbc.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure due to underlying exceptionBEGIN NESTED EXCEPTION com.mysql.jdbc.CommunicationsException MESSAGE: Communication link failure due to underlying exception:BEGIN NESTED EXCEPTION java.io.EOFException MESSAGE: Can not read response from server. Expected 4 bytes, read 0 before connection was unexpectedly lost. STACKTRACE: ... I installed MySQL Server v. 5.1.62 I'm using MySQL/J connector v. 5.0.8 (downloaded from mysql.com) also I put in classpath in NetBeans sqljdbc4.jar Thing I can't understand is fact I didn't change user name and password on my localhost since I created my database. Only thing I changed are: add more tables and changed columns in tables, but that would not trigger this error. And thing I did with my project is I changed charset from UTF-8 to UTF-16, but I guess it hardly can affect my connection method. If I change connector and put in classpath connector v. 5.1.22 it returns error: Access denied for user "root@localhost" (using password: YES) even I declared all privileges for user root.
I am trying to make a simple media player using the following tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aJvPPzhyik To start off with, I will explain what I have done up to now, I downloaded xuggler without using Apache Maven or Apache Ivy, I went into version 5.1 and the and downloaded only the xuggle-xuggler-5.4.jar, I imported this into eclipse and it worked because I started writing my code and all the media class's had no errors. I needed a flv file so I just put in any random youtube link into this website http://keepvid.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvNoKguSdy4Y and got my flv video downloaded to my desktop, now here is where I think the problem is, on the tutorial it show that he has to put this flv video into Xuggle/Workspace/MediaToolsIntro1 but since I just downloaded one jar file I dont have a xuggle folder and only have a jar file on my desktop so I placed it into Users/Me/Workspace/Myjavaproject. I ran the code and got the following error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/LoggerFactory What have I done wrong, when the programmer in the guide video does it he gets a QT file created next to his flv but I get an error, the only difference between me and him is the flv file location.
I’m writing a program in java that send official invoice information to the Fiscal Administration. This public service provided certificates to use in the SSL connection to the web services and to encrypt some especial data fields inside the request body message. I’m having an EOFException error during the handshake phase after client and server have agreed to communicate using the agreed cipher suite that in this case is TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA. Following the SSL protocol the client perform with success a test using the new cipher and send the test data to the server so the server can also repeat the same test and confirm that it is also capable of encrypt and decrypt data. And in this point the server send the EOFException.

I want to remote debug an application running in Tomcat 7. Tomcat is running as a service on a Win2008 server. I added the following to the Java options in the Java Configuration Panel of Tomcat: -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=4711,server=y,suspend=n and opened the firewall on my workstation and the server for this port. But when I try debugging from IntelliJ 9 on my workstation, I get an error message Unable to open debugger port : java.net.ConnectException "Connection timed out: connect". The jvm is the standatd Sun/Oracle 64 bit JVM version 1.6.0_27. I verified that the command line parameters are in use by accessing ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getInputArguments() within the application deployed to Tomcat and logging the result to the log file. I verified via Wireshark on my workstation and on the server that the TCP request on port 4711 is sent from my pc and arriving on the server, but there is is no answer. Running netstat -a on the server does not show a process listening on this port. So I assume somehow Tomcat/JVM does not start the remote debugging.
I am investigating a bug in my application which runs on Weblogic 10.3.4 server. For this investigation, sometimes I need to clear some tables in the database directly (using SQL Navigator). But these changes doesn't reflect immediately in the weblogic server unless I restart it. It is a time consuming task to restart this every time I modify the data in the database. I was wondering whether there is an easy and quick way to clear the database cache in the weblogic server and force it to reload the modified data. I think if I add a ejb which calls the flush method related to every entity and if I call that method, it will do this task. But do you have any suggestion or any other way to do this task, may be by changing a weblogic server setting? Is there any one method call we can do for forcing flushing of all the entities in current container?
I am using struts1.2 and junit 3. In order to test my action classes, I need to create HttpServletRequest objects. Now Struts 1.2 has does not provide a way to create mock objects of HTTPServletRequest. However, Struts1.3 has MockHttpServletRequest.class, with which you can mock the HTTPServletRequest. It's not an option to upgrade from Struts 1.2 to Struts 1.3 at the moment. So what I did was create a jar file out of the mock package in Struts 1.3 and added it to my project. Eclipse content tool does see the MockHttpServletRequest class, ie if I type "Mockhtt" and press CTRL+space, eclipse completes the class name for me and adds the import statement as well. But after I create the HTTPServletRequest object, eclipse gives an error saying "The import org.apache.struts.mock cannot be resolved". What can I do to get around this error? I need to mock the HTTPServletRequest.
We are creating a new web application backed by JPA to replace an old web application. As part of the migration we are converting the old application's database to a new, more sophisticated, JPA-managed database. So I've written a 'script' that converts the old database to a set of JPA entities and subsequently saves them. It works like this: Create an order of conversion based on the dependencies of the domain models For each entity Execute database query to legacy DB Store new object for each obtained table row in a list in memory Iterate over generated lists in the same order as the conversion, and persist each entity. Now, the first two steps work well. Upon persisting, however I get an exception. The exception occurs when one entity has a relation to another entity. For example if one of our entities would be a Book and another would be Chapter defining a @ManyToOne(optional=false) relation to Book. Upon persisting the Chapter, it throws the exception java.lang.IllegalStateException: org.hibernate.TransientPropertyValueException: Not-null property references a transient value - transient instance must be saved before current operation: models.Chapter.book -> models.Book. Of course, this indicates that something is wrong with the state of the book: it seems it is either not set or has not yet been persisted. However, I can verify that the Book is set properly in the conversion of the Chapter, and I can also verify that all entities of type Book are persisted by the EntityManager before the entities of type Chapter get persisted. Obviously, my JPA provider does not behave as expected and does not truly persist my Book objects for some reason. What solution would allow me to save the entire graph of objects that I have converted to the database? I use Hibernate as my JPA provider and I also use Spring 3.1 for injection of dependencies and EntityManagers. EDIT 1: Some additional info: I've again verified that entityManager.persist() is called on each of the book objects before entityManager.persist() is called on the chapters. However, the id of the book object remains null, meaning it is not properly persisted. The database also remains empty, despite not using transactions. EDIT 2: Because I don't think it's clear from the text above: the Book and Chapter story is just an example. It happens for any entity that references another entity. This makes it seem as if I'm not using JPA/Hibernate properly as opposed to not setting the values of my entities properly. EDIT 3: The core issue seems to be that despite persisting Book properly, having all the right annotations, book.getId() remains null. Basically, Hibernate is not setting the ids on my entities after persisting them, leading to problems when I need to use those entities later.
I am trying to configure JDBC Realm in my JSF application and i followed, read multiple blogs but i get the below error in all the cases. SEVERE: jdbcrealm.invaliduserreason WARNING: WEB9102: Web Login Failed: >com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.login.common.LoginException: Login failed: Security Exception I referred both the below links http://jugojava.blogspot.in/2011/02/jdbc-security-realm-with-glassfish-and.html http://blog.eisele.net/2011/01/jdbc-security-realm-and-form-based.html LoginException: Login failed: Security Exception My JDBC Connection Pool Pings, and i have specified the realm inside Configuration > Server-config.

I am using Java Mail API Ver. 1.4.2 for sending out email in JSF 1.2-Spring based Web Application. I am using non secured SMTP connection for sending out a mail. This email configuration is working fine standalone. Also verified this utility using JUnit 4 test and I am able to send mail using non secure connection. When I integrate this email module with main web application I am getting following exception at runtime while sending out a mail. javax.mail.MessagingException: Exception reading response; nested exception is: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake at com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport.readServerResponse(SMTPTransport.java:1764) at com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport.openServer(SMTPTransport.java:1523) at com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport.protocolConnect(SMTPTransport.java:453) at javax.mail.Service.connect(Service.java:317) at javax.mail.Service.connect(Service.java:176) at javax.mail.Service.connect(Service.java:125) at javax.mail.Transport.send0(Transport.java:194) at javax.mail.Transport.send(Transport.java:124) Verified this email module using secure SMTP connection and it's working fine. Anyone having idea on this issue? Why non-secured SMTP connection not working in integration with Web Application?
I am trying to setup my eclipse project to be able to debug an EJB application that is deployable in Jboss 5.1. To configure the debugging options i used the options described here: JBoss debugging in Eclipse I tried the above and it works but with the following limitations: If i change any code, i have to rebuild the application and re-deploy into Jboss and restart the server. We use ANT to build the project so having to rebuild and re-deploy the application because of a small change is not really ideal. I managed two approaches: The first one as described in JBoss debugging in Eclipse. This requires that i copy the war file manually, start up jboss remotely then start the remote debugger in ecliplse. The second approach is i would still copy the war file manually to jboss but not start jboss remotely. Instead i would start jboss within eclipse. This sort of works but the problem is i still have to do the manual deployment when i make a change. I have debugged an application within eclipse running in Tomcat before and with that all i had to do is just restart the server if i make a change to the code. Is it possible to debug an EJB application locally within Eclipse so that if i make a code change all i need to do is restart the server locally and not need to redeploy the war file?
I'm trying to provide users of my java-based software with the option to use sqlite instead the default MySQL because some users don't know what MySQL is, or how to install, or don't want to. I've got everything working fine with sqlite but the query times are extremely slow. A SELECT query, from within java using jdbc takes at least three times as long to return results than when using MySQL. However, the same query run directly in the sqlite console works within milliseconds. It's got to the be the jdbc connection that's causing the slowdown. Any suggestions on what I can do to improve the speed? I've heard about replacing the drivers with the Xerial versions but am not certain how to do that. I'd do that for testing but that's obviously something I doubt we can ask our users to do - if they're against installing mysql they're not going to want to switch drivers for sqlite...
Are there any details on whether or not an object is cleaned up using finalize() if that object's constructor thew an exception. When this method is called is notoriously ill defined. According to the manual: The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will invoke the finalize method for any given object. It is guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method, the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#finalize%28%29 I've not been able to trigger the finalize method in this way. Does anyone know if it is garunteed NOT to be called or if it is in some cases called after the constructor failed to initialize the object (thew an exception). I ask this because I have an object which must not be cleaned up twice. I'm trying to understand if it is safe to clean up before throwing the exception or if I must leave a marker for finalize() to effectively skip and do nothing.
I wrote a simple java tcp client. I specify the server ip address on the command line every time I run the client. When there is no server listening on the specified ip address or the ip address doesn't exist, a SocketTimeoutException is raised. This is working fine for any ip address outside the subnet in which the client is running. If I specify a wrong server ip address on the same subnet of the client, a java.net.NoRouteToHostException is raised instead. This is weird for me. Belonging both addresses to the same subnet there's absolutely no need to have an ip route in order to reach the server. This would be true if the server lives on a different subnet from the client and the host on which the client is running has no default gateway. What I want is simply receive a SocketTimeoutException even for wrong addresses on the same subnet of the client (I mean addresses on which there is no listening server or non-existing addresses). How can I obtain this behaviour? Thank you
Our setup is: Glassfish version 3.1.2.2 - DAS and instance-1 running on the same machine, while instance-2 is running on another machine in the same network as config node. We have set up transaction logging in a shared directory as per the Glassfish High Availability Guide: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18930_01/html/821-2416/gjjpy.html#gaxim We are using unicast configuration for cluster communication since we have Network Load Balancer running in multicast mode in the network. Our application (.ear containing multiple .war) has 2 persistent timers (since we need only one instance per timer at a time in the cluster). When instance-1 (or instance-2) is shut down normally, the other instance recovers up the timers from the shut-down instance as expected. When instance-2 crashes or goes offline abnormally, instance-1 recovers its timers (again, as expected). But when instance-1 crashes, instance-2 does not seem to recover its timers as expected. As far as I can see from the logs, instance-2 receives proper failover message for instance-1 and starts the recovery, but finishes it without recovering any transactions or timers for the failed instance. Can anyone tell me what the problem can be? (Should I provide any more information?)
I am using AdvancedInstaller 9.8 to build my javacode (webapplication) to an installer. Normally my application is running fine. After creating my installer with Advanced Installer 9.8, the installer size is around 55 MB. But there is an option in advanced installer to compress all the jars made for the installation. If i compress the jars, the installer size is around 16 MB. But when I compress with Advanced Installer 9.8, I am getting the exception (as mentioned in the title) when executing the line KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA", "BC"); in my code. Again the KeyPairGenerator is from the package java.security.*; Could anybody please let me know, what could be the cause of this issue. I know when compressing with AdvancedInstaller, it could be some issue with the Advanced Installer compressing. But my question is what could be normally the issue on java side, to get that issue. ( i mean what could be the reason, like any file can be corrupted (or) etc any other reasons) so that I can start working from there.
I know there are some relevant questions, but none of them covers my subject. So, I have a web application using jsp, java, postgresl and apache tomcat 7.0.27.0 embedded inside NetBeans (as a plugin) and in the web directory of the project I have an 116.jpg image When I m displaying this image like that : < img src='116.jpg' alt='title' /> It is being displayed correctly. Now, I want to display an image that I just uploaded and it went to a directory where it is relative to that as this : One directory up, then folder 'data' and finally folder 'img'. So, technically, < img src='../data/img/117.jpg' alt='title' /> This, however, is not being displayed. Moreover... I want to do it automatically . In here <%= sUploadFName %> I have the name of the image that is being uploaded by the user (e.g. 865.jpg ). So, I would want something like that in order to work: < img src='../data/img"<%= sUploadFName %>"' alt='title' /> and the image should appear normally. Can anyone explain me what am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance.
There's a common problem I've come across a few times when logging Exceptions. There seem to be various different types to deal with. E.g. some wrap other Exceptions, some don't have a message at all - just a type. Most code I've seen logs Exceptions using either getMessage() or toString() but these don't always capture all the information needed to pinpoint the problem - other methods such as getCause() and getStackTrace() sometimes provide additional info. As an example, the Exception I'm looking at right now in my Eclipse Inspect window is an InvocationTargetException. The Exception itself has no cause, no message, no stacktrace ... but the target from getCause() is InvalidUseOfMatchersException with these details populated. So my question is: Given an Exception of any type as an input please provide a single method that will output a nicely formatted String containing all relevant information about the Exception (e.g. possibly recursively calling getCause() amongst other things?) Before posting this question I was nearly going to have a stab at this myself but don't really want to reinvent the wheel - surely such a thing must have been done many times before...? Please don't point me at any particular logging or utility framework to do this. I'm looking for a fragment of code rather than a library since I don't have the right to add external dependencies on the project I'm working on and it's actually being logged to part of a webpage rather than a file. If it's a case of copying the code fragment out of such a framework (and attributing it) that's fine :-)
My application is separated into 2 Eclipse projects: A Normal Java Project - contains the Server class, executed on PC A Java Android Project - contains the Activity and Client classes, runs on tablet I created a third project, containing a simple, serializable class, Point. I exported this third project into a jar file, and included it into both my Java and Android projects. I can import the class with no errors. When I run the app and attempt to send a Point object through the network (local) I get a NoClassDefFoundError. This exception is also thrown when trying to simply create instances, so I don't believe it's a network issue. I am convinced this is a problem with my jar file, as sending an object whose class is common for both standard and Android Java worked (I tested with both Integer and ArrayList). Also: I exported the jar using Eclipse built-in export, making it non-runnable, including also source. Using the fatjar plugin also didn't work. Can anyone tell me how to properly set up the jar file library or describe an alternative to sharing a class type between two projects in Eclipse?
I was recently debugging a program that consistently returned errors just a few decimal points off. It turns out the error was on the very line I believed that I didn't need to check: 999999 * (.18 / 12). I knew the parenthesis were not necessary because mathematically, the expression should evaluate to the same answer regardless of their presence, but I included them just for clarity. When I typed the statement into the Python interpreter, however, it returned 14999.98499999999, while the correct answer should be 14999.985. When I removed the parenthesis and typed 999999 * .18 / 12, I got the correct answer (14999.985). Just to make sure it wasn't just a Python thing, I tried it with Java too, same answer. Why is this? I understand that computers can't store fractions as exact values, so some degree of error is to be expected, but what's the difference in the way the computer evaluates those two statements? TL;DR: 999999 * (.18 / 12) gives me a different answer than 999999 * .18 / 12 when mathematically, they should both evaluate to 14999.985. Why?
I have a question about servlet redirection to the same initial page. The following is the scenario: Suppose a user want to buy an item, so he fills in the amount and submits it. The form is submitted to a servlet and the quantity available is checked against the available in the database. So if the amount of items ordered is more than the available the servlet redirects to the same page but with a message like "item is unavailable". So my question is how to implement this case. How to redirect to the same initial page with an error message. I don't want to use ajax here. Here is how I have thought of it as : 1.)should I set a context attribute if error is generated and then check it again in initial page after re-direction and show the message that has been set. What are the best practices for this kind of events?
So I have been banging my head against the wall for days on this one. When I initially set up Subclipse and first connected to my local SVN repo, everything worked great. Not sure what's changed since then, but now I keep getting errors when trying to access the repo. In SVN Repository Exploring perspective, if I double-click on my repo I get a popup that says "Problem Occured - Folder " does not exist remotely". In my console, I get this error: Connection refused svn: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn://userid@localhost/home/userid/myrepository/java' svn: Can't connect to host 'localhost': Connection refused I have: Eclipse Juno Ubuntu 12.04 Subversion 1.7.8 I initially started off with Subclipse 1.6 and JavaHL 1.6 but have since upgraded to Subclipse 1.8.3/JavaHL 1.7.8.1 in my efforts to get everything working again. I even uninstalled Eclipse and reinstalled, re-installed Subclipse and JavaHL, adding the JavaHL path to eclpise.ini... still can't access the repo. I was accessing the repo locally in subclipse via "svn://userid@localhost/svn/home/userid/myrepository/java". I can access this repo locally from the command line just fine, and I can access this repo from another machine on my network using svn+ssh just fine. What am I missing?
I guess I need someone with extensive knowledge to solve my current problem: I use Eclipse to debug jUnit-tests that use Unitils. While debugging, some or all of the tables in my database are locked, even though they are not accessed at the moment. The result is, that other developers working on the same database are unable to run tests as long as I'm debugging (or vice versa). Logically I don't see a reason, why the tables should be locked the whole time. So, should I try to deactivate locking? Do you know how to configure that? Though I can think of alternative approaches, I'd really like to have these questions answered, for this would be the most convenient solution. EDIT: The tests run on an Oracle DB with empty tables. Before each test, Unitils empties EVERY table (unusual configuration for Unitils) and then inserts specific test data. All constraints are active, which again, is an unusual configuration. When I'm debugging and another developer starts a jUnit-Test, their IDE freezes until they get a DB timeout or I stop debugging, due to Unitils trying to empty the tables again.
I am currently investigating a JPA issue we have. I came up with two possible solutions in my mind for that problem. I wrote a set of unit tests that show how each solution would solve the problem. During testing each solution I discovered that one won't work. Now I would like to document why that specific solution won't do the job. I could rewrite the unit tests, that I currently have, to expect exceptions. However the exceptions are only symptoms of the underlying problem of that solution. So I created a new unit test that clearly shows the point, where that solution is in conflict with the JPA specification. However I would like to keep those other failing tests as a documentation of the symptoms that may arise with such a solution. So I could disable them and put javadoc on them saying that they are disabled because of that specific test case. Note that I don't want to have a failing test case. Otherwise I also could use assumes. Is there any other way how I can document that a number of tests don't need to be executed, because they would fail due to another test documenting the real problem being successful? I'm restricted to use junit for my solution. EDIT: Concerning comments and answers so far, I would prefer the Categories, because the test would still be executable without any change, if someone wishes them to be executed. What I'm still concerned with is a stronger association of the tests that represent symptoms of the problems with the real cause. That would currently just be a javadoc link from a symptom test to the real cause test.
I have hadoop 1.0.4 installed. I have modified the /usr/bin/hadoop file by adding the following: HADOOP_DEBUG="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5000" elif [ "$COMMAND" = "jar" ] ; then CLASS=org.apache.hadoop.util.RunJar HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS $HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS" elif [ "$COMMAND" = "jar-debug" ] ; then CLASS=org.apache.hadoop.util.RunJar HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS $HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS $HADOOP_DEBUG" COMMAND="jar" This way I can run "hadoop jar SomeJar.jar SomeClass" to launch normally or run "hadoop jar-debug SomeJar.jar SomeClass" to launch in debug mode. This works, except when I want to pass command line arguments into my class (such as in the WordCount example). For example running: "hadoop jar-debug WordCount.jar WordCount InputDir OutputDir" with a breakpoint on the first line in the main class reveals that String[] args is an empty string (which obviously causes the program to fail later). If I run it using the normal jar command it works fine (so obviously the command line args are get passed in just fine using regular jar). Anyone have any idea whats going on here? I am seriously stuck. Thanks in advance.
I'm trying to load 30 images into a Bitmap array using BitmapFactory but no matter what I do I keep getting OutOfMemoryException.. I tried resizing it and doing the scale way down.. people usually do 4-8 I tried 12,16,20, nothing works.. I have a loop where it loads in a string of URLs and opens a new httpurlconnection each time around, downloads the image, and attempts to save it as a bitmap. the images are roughly 300kb each. I've read other people having this issue with just one or two images so I'm not sure how what I'm looking to do is even possible.. I understand that jpegs and pngs are compressed format and the filesize is wayyy bigger on the phone because its an uncompressed bitmap, but there must be a way to efficently save a bunch of pictures in an array.. because i've seen it done before. I tried the bitmap.recycle() and it took about 20 seconds to load, but didnt memoryerror, then when I tried viewing the image from the bitmap it gave me the 'cannot view recycled image' ? Not sure if anyone else has tried to load many pictures (30-100) and save it in a bitmap array or if its even possible, but either way, let me know! Thanks.
I am trying get JavaCV working for android in order to gain the use of the FFMPEG library. I'm following the setup instructions for android from the JavaCV website which I've copied below: Eclipse (Android 2.2 or newer): Follow the instructions on this page: http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/ Go to File > New > Folder, select your project as parent folder, type "libs/armeabi" as Folder name, and click Finish. Copy javacpp.jar and javacv.jar into the newly created "libs" folder. Extract all the *.so files from javacv-android-arm.jar, opencv-2.4.3-android-arm.zip, and ffmpeg-1.0-android-arm.zip directly into the newly created "libs/armeabi" folder, without creating any new subdirectories. Navigate to Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries and click "Add JARs...". Select both javacpp.jar and javacv.jar from the newly created "libs" folder. I am trying to use the FFmpegFrameGrabber class in my code. When I run, I get this error from logcat: 02-01 14:40:35.550: W/dalvikvm(11583): Exception Ljava/lang/UnsatisfiedLinkError; thrown while initializing Lcom/googlecode/javacv/cpp/avutil; 02-01 14:40:35.550: W/dalvikvm(11583): Exception Ljava/lang/ExceptionInInitializerError; thrown while initializing Lcom/googlecode/javacv/cpp/avcodec; 02-01 14:40:35.550: D/AndroidRuntime(11583): Shutting down VM 02-01 14:40:35.550: W/dalvikvm(11583): threadid=1: thread exiting with uncaught exception (group=0x40015560) This led me to believe that my android app can't find avutil.so and avcodec.so, which I placed in the libs/armeabi folder. However, when I unzipped the APK eclipse generated, both so files were present. Any ideas as to the cause of this problem?
I'm using Eclipse Juno to debug a java class while testing with junit, but the debugger has been acting flakey. I will reach the breakpoint I want and all seems well with the variable values, but in my console, all of the print statements I set up later in the code are popping out as if I were stepping through it! (note: they aren't printing as fast as they normally would if I had simply run it, and the output itself is a bit garbled compared to normal output). Somehow, the code is executing through without me pressing a button. If I try to step through, my view of the code and variables is correct, but debugging stops once Eclipse thinks the program has finished. Something I should probably mention is that I recently put Fedora on my laptop, so I haven't been running eclipse on it for very long and this is my first time trying junit. Is is possible that I need to download something for my debugger?
I am having a JSP page with display tag for pagination. There are some data which is getting passed through URL when I switch pages in display tag. My observation in local system while switching between pages is when the url length is more than 3000 characters, and when I copy the url from the address bar, It is getting trimmed to 2083 characters. But the system works as expected. But In QA and prod, for the same scenario, I am getting a 403 error. I am using a IE browser for which maximum url length is 2083 characters. What I suspect is the the jboss server that is used in QA and prod sends out a 403 if the url length is more than a certain limit. Is this possible? I am pretty sure this issue has got some thing to do with the JBOSS server but couldn't figure out exactly what it is.
I am trying to analyze a heap dump of my Java applet which runs out of heapspace even if i increase the heap size as shown in this post. Applet: Java heap space Now i took some heap dumps today morning (yes..its possible to take digital dumps) and im trying to analyze them with MAT and Visual VM 1.3.5. After running the leak test, the key suspects were org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.JavaModelManager and org.eclipse.jst.jee.archive.internal.ArchiveImpl.. I HAVENT USED ANY OF THESE IN MY CODE. Visual Vm shows that the highest space is taken by Byte[], Int[], Char[], java.lang.string and short[] classes. I am not using too many of these in my program. How should i understand this dump and what should be my next steps? I can post a copy of the dump if needed. Update: MAT is better than visual VM in my case here. I have been taking dumps (again.. digital dumps) and analyzing them with both tools since morning. While VVM shows org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.JavaModelManager and org.eclipse.jst.jee.archive.internal.ArchiveImpl as the suspects in its leak suspect reports, Eclipse memory analuzer (MAT) shows that my swing application is making thumbnails of images in a folder (each image is about 100kb) and showing them as a JToggleButton. But once the thumbnails are added, the JtoggleButton size is 6MB.. hence if there are a 100 images in a folder, the thumbnails of the images will be 600MB atleast. and besides that, i need to do other stuff with this program.. MAT helped in this case to identify the exact objects that took most heap space. Thanks DJ.
I've got a standard WAR application that is working well under JBoss 5.1 and Ubuntu linux 12.10. However, when I try to deploy the same application on CentOS 5.2, I face the following exception on stop (undeploy) operation: java.lang.Error: Error visiting DelegatingHandler@458087116[path=app.war/WEB-INF/lib/aspectjtools.jar context=file:/jboss/server/deploy/ real=file:/jboss/server/deploy/app.war/WEB-INF/lib/aspectjtools.jar Caused by: java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file at java.util.zip.ZipFile.open(Native Method) at java.util.zip.ZipFile.(ZipFile.java:127) at java.util.zip.ZipFile.(ZipFile.java:143) at org.jboss.virtual.plugins.context.zip.ZipFileWrapper.ensureZipFile(ZipFileWrapper.java:175) at org.jboss.virtual.plugins.context.zip.ZipFileWrapper.acquire(ZipFileWrapper.java:245) at org.jboss.virtual.plugins.context.zip.ZipEntryContext.initEntries(ZipEntryContext.java:484) at org.jboss.virtual.plugins.context.zip.ZipEntryContext.ensureEntries(ZipEntryContext.java:619) ... 58 more The aspectjtools.jar is required for load-time weaving AOP. I'm using aspectjtools 1.6.2, but I also tried with latest version 1.7.1, same problem. I've double-checked the ZIP file integrity of that JAR many times, integrity ok. I've created a small application that unzip the war with java.util.zip, no exceptions. I've checked that the unix file descriptor limit was high enough, max limit set. The user starting the JBoss JVM has all the rights on the server directory. I've searched for irregularites in aspectjtools.jar, nothing special. Still can figure out what the problem is and as there are 0 google links for this, I'm wondering if I'm not doing something wrong! I'm running out of ideas, so any help would be appreciated.
I have a Spring 3.2 MVC REST service, which implements error handling by extending ResponseEntityExceptionHandler. This handles the standard Spring exceptions, and will respond with the appropriate HTTP status and custom "Error" ResponseEntity object in XML or JSON as requested by the client. This works great for all of the standard exceptions except HttpMediaTypeNotAcceptableException. The problem I have with this exception is that the reason its thrown in the first place is because the response media type (application/xml, application/json, etc.) could not be determined from the request. If I try to return an "Error" ResponseEntity object for this exception it will fail because the response media type couldn't be determined (which is why this exception is being handled in the first place)...and basically get another HttpMediaTypeNotAcceptableException thrown from my ExceptionHandler. I need to figure out a way when handling HttpMediaTypeNotAcceptableException to specify a valid response media type, so the ResponseEntity makes it to the client. Since requested media type can't be determined, this would probably just be the default for my service (application/xml) Any ideas?

I've read that the new way of creating Hibernate DAO is using Hibernate contextual sessions. The main reason being to avoid the Spring based HibernateTemplate/HiberateDaoSupport and thus Spring-Free DAO. When I searched what to do with Exception translation? It's written everywhere that I should use @Repository! @Repository does need import and creates dependencies in my code. Am I right? Aren't annotations considered dependency? If they are, is there anyway I can have that using XML? Or should I use the old HibernateDaoSupport way, since I'm going to have my code coupled with Spring anyway? Update Found a similar question: "integrate hibernate with spring without spring dependency in dao" but: The first paragraph of the answer that @pap has given does not specify any clear XML alternative for @Repository. The insight offered in the rest of that answer is plausible, yet my question remains unanswered that if decoupling is not much of a concern, why did Spring try proposing the new approach to Hibernate DAO? P.S. This is not a criticism. It's rather an attempt to learn the proper way of thinking about this topic (i.e. the dependency).
When I click on "Help / Eclipse Marketplace", I get a popup progress box that says "Retrieving data from http://marketplace.eclipse.org", waits long enough to be a network timeout, then displays the Eclipse Marketplace dialog with a popup that says java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException. The "details" button doesn't give anything further, and the "error log" gives a lot of data but does not give me any further information (someone else would know what it means, I guess). I am on Windows 7 64-bit, running eclipse Indigo 3.7; as part of working on this problem, I did a "help / check for updates" and let it loose. I ran it again and it said no updates were found. I have looked at internet settings in IE (which I never use) and in Chrome (my default browser); both of them are set to auto-detect network connection settings. The machine is in my home, using a wireless router to a cable ISP, so I don't think any proxy should be necessary. However, I'm a programmer, not a network person, would be happy to learn about something else there that should be checked. I enabled telnet on the windows machine and executed "telnet marketplace.eclipse.org 80"; it cleared the command screen and appeared to be waiting for input. I entered the telnet control character and it popped back to the dos prompt. There seems to be no connection issue to that domain on port 80. My runtime environment is java 1.6.0_24; jre6 is the only installed execution environment that shows up in eclipse ("Windows / Preferences / Java / Installed JREs"). I found one post that claimed that turning ON Windows firewall fixed his issue; I looked and was displeased to find that Windows firewall was already turned on for my machine; I turned it off, but it did not change the error. (I have a hardware firewall, don't know why I would need Microsoft's or BitDefender's.) There are several SO posts on the subject, but none of them seem to fit me closely enough; some of the things I have tried above came from those posts. There are one or two reported bugs on the issue in eclipse, but they seem to be at least a year old and are reportedly fixed. Can someone please tell me how to solve this, or at least where to look?

I'm new to NetBeans and I need a little help with it. I am trying to start my homework, however, I've run into a bit of a problem. Please note that I am NOT asking for help with the assignment itself nor am I asking for anybody to do my homework for me. I am simply trying to solve an unexpected issue with NetBeans. Assignment: http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse219/hw/HW2.html With that said, Everything seems to be working correctly until I get up step 9 of the assignment. The GUI fails to load when I try to run the application and instead I am plagued with a bunch of errors shown in the link below: Errors: http://pastebin.com/udA5rpE2 ******************EDIT************************* Looking at the error message, it seems like Netbeans is confusing my working directory with that of my professor's. So it seems to assume that his directory is within my directory. I edited the run.xml file with purely my directory and it works fine. However, I do not think it's such a good idea to hardcode a directory like this. Is there an alternative? I've tried the solution at the link below, which does work. However, the images on the JButtons do not load when taking that approach. Instead, I am stuck with tiny, empty buttons. Proposed Solution: http://forums.netbeans.org/ntopic45961.html To summarize what's going on, I've made a YouTube video to illustrate the problem. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XcLmk5x5TM&feature=youtu.be
Let me try explaining the situation: There is a messaging system that we are going to incorporate which could either be a Queue or Topic (JMS terms). 1 ) Producer/Publisher : There is a service A. A produces messages and writes to a Queue/Topic 2 ) Consumer/Subscriber : There is a service B. B asynchronously reads messages from Queue/Topic. B then calls a web service and passes the message to it. The webservice takes significant amount of time to process the message. (This action need not be processed real-time.) The Message Broker is Tibco My intention is : Not to miss out processing any message from A. Re-process it at a later point in time in case the processing failed for the first time (perhaps as a batch). Question: I was thinking of writing the message to a DB before making a webservice call. If the call succeeds, I would mark the message processed. Otherwise failed. Later, in a cron job, I would process all the requests that had initially failed. Is writing to a DB a typical way of doing this?
I am receiving the errors: Editor does not contain main type, or, Selection does not contain main type when I import an archived Java project into Eclipse and try to run it. I have gotten this error on several different operating systems. Archive Protocol Export project General->Archive File All are selected: project folder, .classpath and .project [x] save in zip format [x] create directory structure for files [x] compress contents of file A Work Around That May Explain It... but how?! I notice that when I import an archived project into an existing project (a blank Java project), The folder hierarchy is something like: Project src bin imported_project bin src actual_code.java Now, when I try to run actual_code.java, I get the above error. I discovered the following work around: if I drag actual_code.java and drop it into Project->src and then run it, it works. This is a nice work around. However, I would prefer to be able to run the imported project without moving things around. Any suggestions on how to do this? It seems like it should be a trivial fix--it simply seems like the project isn't importing to where it ought to. And yes... I have tried every method I have come across to remedy this. That includes quite a few from this site and others: syntax, libraries, source path, restart eclipse, rearchive, different operating systems, different machines... etc. The .java files are in the src folder before I archive them, and my build path seems correct.
This is more of a best practices question. I hope that it's okay to ask this question here. I am creating an interface that will be used as part of our API. I have a method called getSomeObject() which has a complected logic behind the scenes and returns SomeObject. Behind the scenes I am calling the method which throws IllegalArgumentException, so there is a possibility that my getSomeObject() method may throw this exception. The problem I have is that the user of the API is not familiar with inner workings of the API and wouldn't understand why the exception was thrown. Since the argument is created inside my method and the user doesn't even know that this argument exists. I was trying to document it, but the reason for this exception would confuse the user of the API. So my question is, what is the best way to go about the situation like this? What is the correct way to document this exception?
In a classic 3 tiered application with a presentation tier, service tier and dao tier what is most appropriate way to ensure concise and unduplicated exception reporting log messages. Imagine your dao layer catches any type of checked exception (we'll use Java terminology but same concept applicable to other exception handling languages) and translates that into a daoexception with an appropriate message. Should the appropriate message (eg. "Exception occurred while accessing db" + e.getMessage()) also be logged at the same time in dao layer? Then the service layer catches all daoexceptions, itself provides an appropriate service layer message, translating the daoexception (wrapping it) into a serviceexception and then rethrows. Should the service layer also log the caught exception? In short: Should just the dao layer log it? Should just the service layer log it? Should both tiers log it? Or should each situation be considered on a case by case basis according to usecase / service call etc? I'm ignoring the presentation tier for the purposes of this question.
I can't get any pages of my webapp to load (locally on Tomcat 7.0.2.6), due to this NoClassDefFound error. I'm at my wits end trying to figure out what the cause is, here is what I know: My coworker has this project successfully running locally (on Tomcat) and on our development server (WebLogic). I have done a fresh pulldown from svn so my code is exactly the same as his. I've verified that I have a shared library reference to Aspose (and that the required .jars are in there), and that weblogic.xml has an entry for it. We saw this same error when initially deploying on WebLogic because the Aspose library was named incorrectly, but it ran fine locally on his Tomcat server. I've tried cleaning and rebuilding the project to no effect. As best as I can figure, it has to be either a Tomcat issue, or maybe an Eclipse setting. Has anyone encountered a similar situation? Any ideas on what to try to resolve this?
I'm practicing on Java nio and I created a program to find prime numbers. On running the program, It finds N new prime numbers starting from the last prime stored in a file and it appends the new primes to that file. (N is specified by user) The main algorithm is: It checks odd numbers (n > 3) to see if it is a prime number. For each check, it goes through each prime <= Math.sqrt(n), to see if n % prime == 0. The file stores all the primes, so it is read each time from beginning to check each number. (I don't read it once into an array for the same memory concern and the limitation of array size). Streaming I/O is not good for iterative reading, so I used FileChannel and MappedByteBuffer. I think the algorithm is well known so I won't expand it into details. The file size is growing at each execution and it becomes large. To make I/O more efficient (It reads a lot and FileOutputStream is too slow to write a big file), I mapped the file to an in-memory MappedByteBuffer using FileChannel. The OutOfMemoryError occured when the file size reached over 700M. So I have a couple of questions here: My free physical memory is over 1GB and I set large virtual memory in Windows. How did OutOfMemoryError occur with a 700MB buffer? -- (Many people have asked similar questions but I didn't find a clear-cut answer or any straight-forward solution for this case) If there are any other reasons to cause this error, how can I know the real available memory to allocate before mapping the file? I can allocate a smaller buffer to avoid the error, but what a "safe size" could be -- I want it as large as possible (the same question as above)? And how fast is FileChannel.read(ByteBuffer) compared to FileChannel.map() or FileChannel.map().load()? Any help will be appreciated.

I'm developing a C++ program (Win32, MS Visual Studio 2008) which creates a Java VM via JNI as outlined here. It has been working fine for a long time, with both Java 6 and Java 7. Today I have installed a new version of JRE; something went wrong in the installer, and the JRE become corrupt. I noticed that my C++ program doesn't start and doesn't issue any warning messages. Debugging the program showed that it runs successfully until the JNI_CreateJavaVM call; but calling JNI_CreateJavaVM causes the program to instantly terminate. No return values, no error messages, nothing. Yes, I know that I simply have to reinstall JRE. But nevertheless I'd like my C++ program to be prepared to such situation. If it's unable to create a Java VM, it should show a message "Please reinstall JRE". But I don't have a chance to show that message because the whole program is terminating. Is there a way to detect such type of errors in JRE, or more generally, in a third-party library? I tried using C++ try/catch constructs, I tried using the signal function - nothing helps; the program disappears without calling any catch or signal handlers. Is there a way to detect such JRE crash? Or: is there a way to reliably detect a crash or termination inside a third-party library?
Below are 4 related posts I could find on Stack Overflow: Validation Error: Value is not valid Validation error value is not valid Jsf : Validation error value is not valid for SelectOneMenu JSF with Enum 'Validation Error: Value is not valid' In these posts, the posters didn't know why they had this error message. In my case, I do know why I have this error, and I would like to change the default "Validation Error: Value is not valid" message to let's say "This is my message". How could I achieve this? PS1: I already tried the requiredMessage, validatorMessage and converterMessage attributes, but none of them get called in this special case. PS2: I'm using RichFaces 4.1.0, so the drop-down list I'm using is the rich:select one. Scenario: I have two entities, for example employers and employees. I create the employee employee1. I want to create the employer employer1, and link it to the employee1 via a drop-down list. Before submitting the employer creation form, I delete the employee1 from the database. Then, I submit the employer creation form: the said message appears next to the drop-down list, since the employee1 isn't available anymore. This behavior is the one I expected, but I just would like to change the default message to another one, more user-friendly.
I have been given the classical task of transferring files using UDP. On different resources, I have read both checking for errors on the packets (adding CRC alongside data to packets) is necessary AND UDP already checks for corrupted packets and discards them, so I only need to worry about resending dropped packets. Which one of them is correct? Do I need to manually perform an integrity check on the arrived packets or incorrect ones are already discarded? Language for the project is Java by the way. EDIT: Some sources (course books, internet) say checksum only covers the header, therefore ensures sender and receiver IP's are correct etc.. Some sources say checksum also covers the data segment. Some sources say checksum may cover data segment BUT it's optional and decided by the OS. EDIT 2: Asked my professors and they say UDP error checking on data segment is optional in IPv4, defauld in IPv6. But I still don't know if it's in programmer's control, or OS's, or another layer...
I ran into a funny situation because java's File.listFiles() method returns a list of Files in a directory without any guarantees on the order. One class reads some information from all files in a directory using this listFiles() method and writes to an OutputStream. A corresponding JUnit test cases tries to compare the data written to the output stream with some expected byteArray. The test passed on my dev machine and the production stack, but failed on a dev server because it uses a different OS and a different version of Java. In how to File.listFiles in alphabetical order? the solution is to force the sorting of the array returned from File.listFiles(). But I am not comfortable about this solution because it is doing some extra work just so the JUnit test can pass. So I am just wondering if there is a better way. Any advice? Thanks

I'm having this strange problem where an Android application will freeze inside innocuous code. It only crashes when when the external jar is compiled without debug information, but when compiled with debug information the app runs just fine. It freezes on the same line of code that's located inside the external library, but only after multiple passes. Several other external jars are used, that don't have debug information, without any problems. There is no IO activity going on in this part of the code. There is no native code in the project that could be stomping on memory causing random errors either. The freeze happens on multiple devices. This process is in its own thread and is computationally intensive. When the same library/jar is used in a desktop application there are no problems. Both Java 6 and 7 have been used to compile app + libraries The library in question is DDogleg. The three other external jars do not appear to be having any problems. External jars are included in a 'libs' directory Build Environment: IDE: IntelliJ 12 Android SDK: android-17 OS: Linux Mint 13 and Windows 7 JDK: 1.7.0_13 and 1.6.0_41 (original question stated that it crashed when included as a jar, but not when compiled inside the application)

I downloaded eclipse IDE for Java developers 64 bit (actual download name:eclipse-java-juno-SR1-win32-x86_64.zip) and unzipped it to my desktop I've tripled checked that my system is 64 bit(Start>Control Panel>System>System type:64 bit operating system) I've found and deleted java.exe and javaw.exe from C:\windows\system32 which resolved the error message "C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\lib\amd64\jvm.cfg' My problem as of now is the following error message when i try to start eclipse: Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:\Program Files(x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_15\bin..\jre\bin\client\jvm.dll I've made sure that this .dll file is there. I have looked around and everyone says to make sure everything is 64 bit. I have no clue what to do now. How I fix? Any and all help is greatly appreciated.
Could you please help me with my struggle to start/build my first hello world application for android? I am using ubuntu as my operating system. I downloaded android sdk as well as Intellij. I added libraries. I handled error connected to missing android.app by mentioned previously libraries. Unfortunately I met another issue with the following message: Information:Compilation completed with 33 errors and 0 warnings in 9 sec Information:33 errors Information:0 warnings trouble processing "javax/crypto/ExemptionMechanismSpi.class": Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*) when not building a core library. This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your application's project, when using an IDE (such as Eclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's going on. However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality. If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use the "--core-library" option to suppress this error message. If you go ahead and use "--core-library" but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem. If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation. 1 error; aborting What do I do wrong?
I am implementing a chunked upload solution for my service, which stores blobs in Azure. This is written in Clojure, using azure-sdk-for-java. I am able to upload and commit chunks as blocks in a block blob. Before I upload any block, however, some validation must be performed. This includes things such as checking how much the user has uploaded so far against the content-range they supply (we do not allow blocks to be re-uploaded). To accomplish these checks, I am using CloudBlockBlob's method, downloadBlockList to get data about committed and uncommitted blocks as needed (and also to get the block list when it is time to commit). On some occasions, though, this fails, and I receive the following exception: "com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.core.storage.StorageException: Server failed to authenticate the request. Make sure the value of Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature." This is strange because I never get this failure if I call downloadBlockList after uploading a block, but I get it (on some occasions, but always the same occasions) if I call the method and don't upload. If I catch the exception and immediately call downloadBlockList again, it works fine. I have used tcpdump to take a look at the headers that are being sent, as on some forums people have mentioned x-ms-date being set wrong, but this is not the case, and nothing looks incorrect. The response is 403, and complains about the MAC signature in the request being wrong. Does anyone have any ideas why this would happen sometimes, but if I call the method again, immediately after, in an identical way, it works?
I don't know what I did, but what was once working no longer works. I am calling a function that returns an instance of a particular class, call it MyClass. MyClass depends on another class, MyOtherClass that is defined in a package. This package (call it com.myotherpackage) is contained in a plugin (call it com.myotherplugin) listed in the dependencies section of my plugin manifest. When I call that function, I get the error "The type com.myotherpackage.MyOtherClass cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class file." What could I have done to cause this error to crop up where previously the error wasn't present and my code ran just fine? I've searched for solutions. They all seem to focus on non-plugin environments. One such solution had something that I could map to a plugin. It suggested I configure my build path (right click on project -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path). From this dialog, I selected the Libraries tab, clicked the arrow next to Plug-in Dependencies, then clicked the arrow next to com.myotherplugin, then clicked the arrow next to Access rules, and found that there is a checked check box next to the words "Accessible: com/myotherpackage/*". Thus the package appears to be available though I have no information from this view that MyOtherClass is contained in that package. Any ideas would be appreciated.
Sorry in advance. This is a really vague question because I have no idea whatsoever what is going on. I have a Java Swing GUI desktop app that I wrote in NetBeans. While inside of NetBeans, the app works fine and passes all of the tests that I have thrown at it. I've been developing this app over the past several months, deploying it at various phases of its development. Yesterday, I finished adding and testing some new functionality. I built the application and put it on another computer. I then went to run the program (outside of NetBeans) straight from the jar file. While in the new areas (JDialog boxes), the program crashes. Since I am not in an IDE, I have no feedback to see what is wrong. The only thing that I can think of (and this is lame) is that I added some switch statements that switch on strings, which I know to new to 1.7. I was previously developing in 1.6. Otherwise, I can think of no reason that the program should work flawlessly inside the IDE, but crash outside of it. Can anyone offer any suggestions for how I should approach this? I'm at a complete loss. Thanks very much.
So, I've got this problem - a strange problem. I have a library as part of an IDEA project - in which all the code is publicly visible under 'tk.*' (IE: all classes exist in sub-packages of tk). Should the attempt be made to import a class residing within that package IDEA highlights the import statement (only th 'tk' mind you - which is strange enough), citing the reason mentioned later. Despite the apparent "errors", the project (consisting of a formidable number of files) compiles successfuly - very much so, infact. Info: The highlight reason (when you hover over the aforementioned highlight): 'tk' is not public in '' Note about this: the file importing from said package IS NOT in the default package. It would seem that the importing from packages residing in other libraries is not found at fault by IDEA The class(es) imported by aforementioned file(s) are not package-private, nor protected, nor private - they are public The project's path settings should be correct, however I am open to the suggestion that these may be at fault Notes: Sorry if this quiestion reads wierdly - I'm rather distracted by the environment in which I currently reside.
If I concurrently modify a Java Set, I'll get a ConcurrentModificationException. The problem is that the stack trace suggests the modification was encountered on a certain Map iterator. I now understand that Maps are used to implement Sets in java but these details are internal to the implementation. I believe the internal Map iterator Exception should have been properly wrapped inside a Set Iterator related exception that should have been passed back. Am I making sense or am I missing something? I just spent two days trying to find the non-existent faulty Map operation in the code only to ultimately stumble upon (zooming in through trial and error, not by a logical process or documentation) on the Set operation that was causing the problem. I am wondering how I can avoid such frustrations in future. -----------UPDATE-------------- My query is not about how to get the concurrency right. My query is how to avoid getting misguided by such unhelpful stack trace messages. A Map Iterator exception has no business showing up in the stack traces instead of the actual SetIterator exception which makes sense from the user's perspective

I'm creating a wrapper for a very basic AI API. When something goes wrong in this API it does not throw any exception or elsehow reports a problem. It is possible to recognise an error before an API call is called (ex. wrong argument). In the wrapper I want to implement an error indication by throwing runtime exception. For now the client can decide whether he wants to handle them or not. In exceptional cases I throw a checked exception but there is a very good reason for it. The problem is that when any exception is thrown the program stops and it needs to continue regardless. I was thinking stop throwing exceptions and just report the problem as warning in the logger but then client does not know that an error occurred. The AI calls a method for update every second say. Handling checked exceptions is nasty and code gets very ugly for even calling a very simple call.

java.nio.channels.AsynchronousFileChannel offers two methods to read data from a file: read(dst, position, attachment, handler) will call the provided handler when completed read(dst, position) returns a Future which will allow me to get() the result of the operation The CompletionHandler interface specifies a method failed(Throwable exc, A attachment), whereas the Future does not. It only has the option to throw an ExecutionException from its get() method. Let's say I read from a file on a flaky disk, and the disk throws an IO-Error, how will this be handled in the two cases? Specifically, I have the following 3 questions: Will the failed() method on the CompletionHandler be called? Or will it indicate the operation as completed with a result of -1? Will the get() method on the Future throw an Exception, or will it simply return -1 as the read result? If -1 is returned in either case, how can I distinguish between an IO-Error and a simple EOF condition (preferably without a hack like timing the operation)? For some reason, I can't find any documentation on this...
I would like to know if there is any IDE or Eclipse Plugin that supports mixed mode debugging. As I searched the term mixed mode, found lot of references debugging VM languages alongside with native code. But I referring to a feature that is similar to the one available in compiled languages such as C where an user can see both C source line along side with the corresponding assembly line and will be able to step in even at assembly level. (please excuse If I had made a nomenclature mistake by calling the feature as mixed mode) In other words I am looking for a following features while debugging java: Ability to the java source code and the corresponding byte codes during program execution Ability to see JVM PC registers and Operand stacks Ability to view other JVM specific data structures (for example constant pools) This is to understand how the Java source code maps to byte codes and how the various JVM associated data structures are affected while stepping in.
I created a JPA project that I want to use in a dynamic web project. I made a jar from this JPA project and added it in a lib folder in the dynamic webproject. I then added this to the buildpath of the dynamic web project and also ticked it in the "Order and Export" tab. First question : I created the jar file with a normal export to jar with these options; Are these ok or do I have to add something. Second question: After I added this jar to the buildpath and I use a instance of a class from within this jar I can add it to the imports and the class is know so I don't see any errors. When I try to run the jsp and servlet where I use the class I get a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error in my apache with a java.lang.ClassNotfoundEception at the line where I use the class. So for some reason he doesn' find the class at runtime. I tried to make the jar over and over again with different options. I tried to import the class I need on different way's (ctrl-T) but I only see one class. The only thing I find strange is the way the import looks. In my JPA project I have a package structure like : be.JPA.project6 in my dynamic web project I have a package structure like : be.project6 when I see the import, I see : be.JPA.project6.data.classname I would expect that a different structure so he would know that he needs to search outside the "normal" package structure. But also with "ctrl-T" I only can see this class I don't want to make a reference to the other project but use it like this with a jar. I'm out of any clues at the moment, so any advise would be more then welcome.
I have a bit of an oddity I'm hoping someone can shed some light on. I'm using Hibernate 3.6.10 and Spring Framework 3.1.2.RELEASE. I have a @Controller with methods annotated both @RequestMapping and @Transactional, which I know is a bad thing. We have to do it this way for now due to some tedious issues, but that's not really the issue here. All Lazy Loading works as expected within the Controller/Transactional. These transactional methods call into a @Service with methods also marked with plain old @Transactional, which should keep everything in the same transaction, as Propagation.REQUIRED is the default. So far so good. Now here's the befuddling tidbit. The @Service method throws an XyzException that extends RuntimeException, supposedly marking the transaction as rollback-only. By this logic, the one and only transaction that's being used should rollback and any attempt to handle the XyzException in the @Controller method without rethrowing before the transaction ends should result in another, less expected RuntimeException from Hibernate saying that the commit action failed due to the transaction being marked rollback-only. But it doesn't. Instead, the transaction rolls back and the redirect (using POST, redirect, GET) successfully happens. No exceptions, no mess. So the question is, "What am I doing to make this work as it does?" I have an OpenSessionInViewInterceptor being used, so I thought maybe the transactions were not actually starting at the @Controller level. When I removed the @Transactional, however, the Lazy Load actions broke. - EDIT - So regardless of the OSIV nonsense, does it make sense that I'm able to handle an XyzException inside of the @Transactional method? I thought handled RuntimeExceptions inside of @Transactional methods that were not re-thrown would cause an error. Does it matter that the @Transactional method in question is the entry point (i.e. The first @Transactional method called)?
Here is my situation: I'm working with an application that makes heavy use of JSP includes <%include ... %> and also loads tons of components dynamically using AJAX. All these get loaded into one main template page depending on what the user selects, etc. My issue is with editing/maintaining these small page fragments that get included and loaded through AJAX. Since they are fragments, their code does not include a and doesn't include things like JQuery, which are added by the main template page. Of course when they are loaded in the browser they work since the fragments are loaded through AJAX and added to the DOM. The issue is: since these are just fragments, when I'm maintaining these pages I get a lot of errors and warnings on missing CSS classes and Javascript variables, etc. Besides, I can't use any WYSIWYG editors for the fragments due to the missing imports. How can I tell Eclipse to assume certain imports (e.g. JQuery or CSS sheets)for these fragment files? Since using JSP templates is such a common design pattern I can't believe I'm the only person needing this.
One strategy for handling validation of a form that is posted to a Java Servlet is to forward back to the original JSP view on validation failure. This allows the user to see that there was a validation failure in the context of the form they just submitted (perhaps they didn't provide a value for a required field), and then they can retry. However, since this strategy doesn't follow the well known Post-Redirect-Get pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get) it suffers in that the browser history now includes a non-bookmarkable page. If the user later tries to access this page via the history/back button they'll get a document expired exception (in Firefox 19 at least). How should this be handled? Is there a better way? Note: the strategy I'm describing is actually recommended in the Servlet info page: (https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info). There is no mention of browser history issues though. Note: this question is similar: (JSF PRG with validation error). It suggests using AJAX for posts. If this is the recommended strategy maybe we need to update the Servlet wiki? Not exactly sure how this would translate from JSF to servlets anyways.

Context: I have an abstract class SuperClass, which has a substantial number of subclasses, each working on a different business object, but in similar fashion. I need to add some new functionality which definitely has its place in SuperClass, but will rely on a subclass-specific attribute, that I need to get in the superclass method. The obvious way here is to add an abstract getter in SuperClass for the attribute, and have every subclass override it so that it can send the correct attribute when called. The catch is: I am not allowed to change the code of other subclasses than the one I'm working on because of a fear of regressions. So I can't add an abstract method, as the other subclasses would not compile anymore. Since only the object I'm working on now will require this new functionality, I can afford to declare a standard non-abstract method in SuperClass, and return null there. Then override it in the subclass I'm working on, and voilà. Question: If someone who doesn't read my warnings in the Javadoc properly ever try to call this new method from a different subclass, it will produce unexpected results due to the getter not being properly overriden. Rather than returning null (and unexpected results) in SuperClass, I think throwing an exception would be more elegant and useful for my fellow programmers. I could define a custom-made exception, but does something along the lines of YouForgotToImplementSomethingException or PleaseReadTheJavadocException exists in the "standard" exceptions? Edits: Throwing an Error as suggested in an answer is not something I'm very fond of, but maybe here it could make sense to emulate the compiler's behavior? Thoughts on this?
I was wondering if there was a way to tell Hibernate to generate some kind of console warning when it has too many objects of a certain type in the session cache. I would like to do this for load testing as we have OutOfMemoryException problems on occasion with BLOB loading from Oracle. We are still using Hibernate 3.6.10 for now. Our best approach for this testing at the moment is to just generate more data than the system would be able to handle in a normal use case and try to load the parent object and see if it crashes. Doing it this way just feels kind of bad. Any suggestions are welcome. One note that I forgot to mention is that this "logging" idea is something I would like to be able to leave in production code to pinpoint specific problems. - EDIT - Here's an example of what I'm trying to do: Say I have an @Entity ClassX that has a lazy loaded list of @Entity ClassY objects. Some how, I would like to have a log message spit out when 100 or more instances of ClassY are loaded into the session cache. This way, during development I can load a ClassX object and notice if I (or another developer on the team) happen to be accessing that list when I shouldn't be.
Actually this issue is related with my previous question Catching ANTLR's NoViableAltException in Java and ANTLRWorks Debugger, but I decided to split them because of different symptoms. The issue is about feeding to ANTLR input text, which contains unknown tokens. Consider for example, that our grammar doesn't known anything about tokens which start with @ symbol. If we will try to feed such text to ANTLRWorks interpreter, we will receive NoViableAltException in result graph. But if we will take generated and compiled grammar in Java and try to parse such invalid text with it, we can receive one of the following result (it depends on where we will place this unknown token, i.e. how "deeply" we will put it into text): 1) no errors, and null value in chidlren field in top-level CommonTree object (the mentioned question about is exactly about this case); 2) java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error. This question is about second case. How we could prevent this behaviour of ANTLR parser? For example, in production clients could accidentally crash down a system by providing incorrect char sequence to DSL parser.

I have a Java application which initially reads 3 lakhs of data from my MYSQL database.Then it calls an API using an ExecutorService with newFixedThreadPool size=20. After getting the response from the API it is inserting the responses to my DB.It is working fine for first 2000 rows(nearby).After that I am getting an error like following. SQLError-com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: The driver was unable to create a connection due to an inability to establish the client portion of a socket. This is usually caused by a limit on the number of sockets imposed by the operating system. This limit is usually configurable. For Unix-based platforms, see the manual page for the 'ulimit' command. Kernel or system reconfiguration may also be required. For Windows-based platforms, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 196271 (Q196271). Anyone could help me to fix this issue?
I have looked at some of the other questions covering this topic, but I don't see this particular issue anywhere. I have a test that clicks on a Web Element. I have tried referencing it by ID and by XPath, and waiting for it to become visible using wait.until(). Sometimes it seems to work fine, but other times I get ElementNotVisibleException. (Actually, since I added the wait.until(), I get TimeoutException, but if I removed that, it would throw ElementNotVisibleException.) That is, I can run the test once and it will be able to click the element and proceed to completion. Other times, I get the exception. The issue is not whether I get one exception or the other, the issue is getting the exception sometimes, but other times being able to reference the element without any exception at all. I have not made any changes that I am aware of. The page appears to load quickly and correctly every time. There are no server issues I am aware of. Roughly about half the time it throws the exception, and the other half it can reference the element without any problems. Is this likely to perhaps be more of a problem with the underlying web site code than with Selenium? I have checked the computed CSS values manually and they appear to indicate that the element should be visible.
In the javadocs for Guava's ImmutableMap it says: Performance notes: unlike HashMap, ImmutableMap is not optimized for element types that have slow Object.equals(java.lang.Object) or Object.hashCode() implementations. You can get better performance by having your element type cache its own hash codes, and by making use of the cached values to short-circuit a slow equals algorithm. So my first question is how do I know if my element has a slow .equals or .hashCode implementation? In my specific instance, I'm using a java Enum as my key, so that has an efficient default implementation of .equals and .hashCode, right? (I assume the implementation of those for the values is irrelevant so long as you aren't accessing the map using the values' values.) My second question is what does "having your element type cache its own hash codes" even mean! Googling around I couldn't seem to find an example of how you would do that. I assume maybe that means you end up with hashcodes within hashcodes? So I get into the hashcode bucket, and then the .equals methods uses a second set of hashcodes within that?

Do Google App Engine backends always end with a HardDeadLineExceeded after about a day of processing? After my backend (B8) process runs for about a day and a half, it is invariably shutdown with a HardDeadLineExceeded exception. On the dev server, it takes about two days to finish the same queued task. I thought backends could possibly run indefinitely, though not guaranteed, according to https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/backends/overview#ShutdownGoogle . But, what I'm seeing is almost assuredly that the backend will be terminated within a day or so, which seems like more of a policy than happenstance due to: -"The machine running the backend is restarted, forcing your backend to move to a different machine." or -"App Engine needs to move your backend to a different machine to improve load distribution." My task is to parse through huge XML files with Stax, and write out a set of CSV files from the results, to the blobstore. Now that the premier feature of "Always On" is gone, it seems there is no other option than to handle the shutdown request, but this would involve saving the StAX XML Parser cursor state (which may not be possible) and writing out the outputted file frequently back to the blobstore. So ... backends aren't really good at being backends, imo.
Note: this is not a question about server or client Java applications. It's about the client and server versions of the HotSpot VM. I am currently using Eclipse 4.2 and Oracle's Java 1.7, though this applies to all versions of Java and Eclipse. If I use Eclipse's Run button to execute a Java class, with no extra configuration, will it run the client or server VM? I know that I can set these individually with VM options, but if I want to change the setting for my whole project, without having to configure each class, where can I do that? (For example, it's defaulting to client but I want to make sure it runs server.) Does the Debug button run a different VM than the Run button? I imagine it's probably harder to attach a debugger to the server VM. Are both supported for debugging or will it always run the client VM, for example? Looking for an authoritative answers to this question, supported by facts. Thanks!
I have a maven project which actually builds as multiple java projects. Project B contains a class which is a child of a class sin Project A. When I try to run this class in a debugger I get a NoSuchMethod error when the method tries to call any functionality from it's parent. The Maven setup is designed to compile every single project and place it in the maven repository so other projects can find them (it has a sense of dependency so it builds pre-req projects firsts). This is all good for deployment, but I don't want to force people debugging in eclipse to do a maven install every time the start up their debugger. Instead I tried adding pre-req projects to the class path of the applicable projects (build path -> add class folder). This doesn't work. I think it's due to having both the maven repository and the class path in my build path? but the class folders should be parsed forced and the newer class folders should be parsed before the maven install right? How can I configure this to work without needing to re-do a maven install each time?
I hate warnings. Our Android project has 151 now, and I am sure that somewhere down the list there is one that actually warns us against a potential trouble. One type of these warnings is about deprecated fields and methods. This could be useful, except that the Manifest contains <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="10" />, and these warnings only take into account the target SDK which is android-17. It's easy to mute these warnings - add @SuppressWarnings("deprecation") annotation before the offending line, or the whole method. But this misses the whole point of it - if/when we decide to change minSdkVersion="11", the APIs that are deprecated at level 10 will still not show up, and somebody will have to go through all annotations in all our project, to find which code must be rewritten. Is there some solution that could manage these warnings based on my minSdkVersion? It seems that Mark who posted an interesting answer below, and even filed a feature request inspired by my question does not agree with me about the importance of minSdkVersion. He would prefer to see deprecation warnings (most likely from Lint, similar to the @TargetApi(NN) annotations) based on the target API level. But I cannot agree with this approach. Consider a simple application that opens the Camera. It might want to check the preview frame rate. But this method was deprecated at API 9, and now we must check the preview FPS range. If we use platforms/android-8/android.jar, the Java compiler will not show deprecation warnings. But it will not allow us to find the preferred video resolution, even in case the application is running on a device that supports such query. We will probably add @TargetApi(11) annotation there, to make sure the application is built with platforms/android-11/android.jar or higher. Now that we have target Honeycomb and higher, the deprecation warning will be shown for getPreviewFrameRate(), and this is exactly what bothers me. For a while, my imaginary application must support some Froyo devices, therefore I have no choice but set minSdkVersion=8 and use the deprecated method. Naturally, I will use any advanced APIs in conditional blocks, and have the @TargetApi(NN) in place. Luckily, for Donut and higher, the class loader does not crash when a call to a non-existent method or member is detected, and wrapping the questionable calls in mere if() is enough. So what do I do? Add @SuppressWarnings("deprecation") around the calls to getPreviewFrameRate() to mute the warnings? Add @SuppressDeprecation(8) instead? But at some point, I will decide that the backward compatibility with Froyo is not important anymore. I set <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="9" /> in my Manifest, but the deprecation warnings for getPreviewFrameRate() are still suppressed... Well, the new approach is definitely better than the existing annotation, because it's easier to grep -R "@SuppressDeprecation(8)" the whole project after the change is made in Manifest. But I would prefer a bit more tight integration here: let Lint parse the Manifest file for me. Does this make better sense now?
In Java (newer version) and windows xp (ntfs): 1 - Existing file f, Files.createFile(Paths.get(f)) : FileAlreadyExistsException 2 - Existing file f, Files.createDirectory(Paths.get(f)) : FileAlreadyExistsException 3 - Existing folder fo, Files.createDirectory(Paths.get(fo)) : FileAlreadyExistsException 4 - Existing folder fo, Files.createFile(Paths.get(fo)) : AccessDeniedException Why is the last one different? Linked to this question, what is the conceptual difference ? Doesn't it mean for a folder or a file the same when they are "writable". Or a locked file or folder, you can't access the content. I think actually of a folder as a file with a contents list. You can open it actually with vim. So in the end, why are all filesystem elements which contain binary or textual data. This two fold policy is making stuff complicated. In this respect I actually do like the unix philosophy of files. It doesn't make a difference between folders, files and device files (special files). And as hierarchical filesystem structure is actually the gof4 composite pattern I think I'm right, it is abstracting away a "Filesystemelement" as well. Why is Java complicating things here?
I am using List Class in my project and it continuously giving the below mentioned error. I have tried using new Eclipse and new workspace but then same problem.

I am trying to read and parse an rss feed from a 2 jetty servers (Eclipse - Google Plugin): one with App engine SDK enabled and one without it. 1. When i test on the jetty run with app engine enabled it works fine 2. When i use the same code on a jetty server without app engine enabled i get the following message (because the received text is empty): javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException: ParseError at [row,col]:[1,1] Message: Premature end of file. I searched the code for a premature reading of the input stream (I use new URL(host) and url.openStream() to read the input), but the code is OK (if it wasn't it wouldn't probably work in the first case). I used tcpdump (-s 1024 -l -A dst host.com -i wlan0) to examine the headers: first case: GET /rss/...

Is there a way to set the exact same headers ? And would it solve the problem ?
I'm very new to SSL so please bare if I have asked any dumb question. I'm developing a Java EE web application which deals with credit card transactions. Here I'm trying to use a p12 certificate from cybersource. I have a local, dev environment which runs in Windows and I use tomcat a my app server. Everything works fine in my local environment. When I move the same application to a Unix/Websphere environment I'm getting, "com.cybersource.ws.client.ClientException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.h: No trusted certificate found" even after giving the right certificate path in the UNIX box. I consulted with my UNIX admin team for this issue, and they asked me to convert p12 file to JKS and place in the WEB_INF/Classes folder. I have done it using keytool and converted the p12 cert to JKS. Still my WebSphere could not recognize the certificate location. How is the type of file related here? Why can't I use the p12 file instead of JKS. My UNIX team says, I have to deal something with my code. I'm stuck with this issue since a week. Please let me know if you need further clarification.
I recently ported a fairly large application from C# to Java. It ought to have about 6 main threads running and lots of timers being fired (but each executing only briefly). I make use of the Timer class and call myTimer.schedule(new TimerTask() { ... Now that I'm at the end of the port, I'm having a problem debugging the application in Eclipse, especially lately. I set a breakpoint: Eclipse will hit it but I can't step through at that point. I don't think I can look at variable values or stack trace or anything. I see my list of threads going crazy, and based on output statements I've written, I can see that Thread.activeCount() gets to be over 200 threads. I am curious as to whether this is my debugging problem. Have I overloaded Eclipse to the point that it goes crazy? From the threads I can actually see, most of them are my Timers that have been run. Somewhere I read that the JVM will keep those alive even if you cancel them (?). Anyway, if it's including all of the timers I've fired then perhaps over 200 threads makes sense. I did once today also see an Eclipse "out of memory" error. Any advice? Thanks.
I recently installed the latest version of the Android SDK which includes Eclipse. Upon trying to run Eclipse, I first came up with the error A Java Runtime Environment or Java Development Kit must be available... as many other users have found. I realized that I had incorrectly installed Java, and fixed that problem. That error message no longer appears. However, I am now getting the message: Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_17\bin\..\jre\bin\client\jvm.dll I looked up the issue and found that many people suggest editing the eclipse.ini file to include a -vm argument. I have tried this, but I cannot save the file. Whenever I try, I receive an error message saying Access is denied. I am running Windows 8. Both Eclipse and Java are 64-bit. I am the sole administrator on the computer. If you can provide me with any ideas how to fix my problem, I'd really appreciate it.

I recently started learning about Android app development. It's also my first experience with the Java language. There are some debugging tools that I want to incorporate into my app development in a form of Java package dependency. For obvious reasons, I would like to include it only for debug builds. In iOS, we can use build configuration to link with debugging libraries only for debug builds, and use macros to remove parts of code that deals with debugging. This makes it really easy to switch between debug and production builds. Anyway to achieve the same for Android? So far, the closest I got is using Maven profiles to overwrite properties files, which gets loaded by the application, but this requires that the debugging libraries are still imported. To clarify my question, here is what I want to do: I built a library that will let you browse the SQLite database on your browser. It's really useful for debugging purposes, but I don't want to ship my app with the library. Another purpose is to use HockeyApp. HockeyApp provides two features: Update notification, and crash reporting. I need three different builds for this to work: Production: Crash reporting On, Update notification Off Beta: Both On Debug: Both Off
Ok this is really frustrating. I'm using my API key perfectly fine. Authentication does just fine, token is generated fine, session key is also OK. But when I run the playlist.create, the playlist is not created. Addendum (6 April 2013): It turned out I had to generate a new md5 hash for my sig, but even after doing so, the method does not work. Addendum 2 (9 April 2013): I started from almost scratch today, and redid most of my code. I created 16 playlists successfully, no errors. But today, the same code's not working. I didn't touch it at all and yet the error. nvm For security purposes, I cannot show you my security keys. However, I did write a quick program to find the last.fm session key: http://github.com/thekarangoel/LastFMSessionKeyFinder Simply register at last.fm/api, enter your API key and secret in the program and you'll have everything you need to test the API call.
Recently Apple modified their Technical Note TN2265 - Troubleshooting Push Notifications. They added a section about throughput and error checking. This is taken from that section : Here's how to check for errors when using the enhanced binary interface. Keep writing until a write fails. If the stream is ready for writing again, resend the notification and keep going. If the stream isn't ready for writing, see if the stream is available for reading. If it is, read everything available from the stream. If you get zero bytes back, the connection was closed because of an error such as an invalid command byte or other parsing error. If you get six bytes back, that's an error response that you can check for the response code and the ID of the notification that caused the error. You'll need to send every notification following that one again. Once everything has been sent, do one last check for an error response. It can take a while for the dropped connection to make its way from APNs back to your server just because of normal latency. It's possible to send over 500 notifications before a write fails because of the connection being dropped. Around 1,700 notifications writes can fail just because the pipe is full, so just retry in that case once the stream is ready for writing again. My APN provider server is written in Java using blocking sockets (SSLSocket). Is it possible to do what they suggest in the bold text using SSLSocket? After a write fails, can I write again to the socket? Doesn't the socket close in this case? How do I know if the stream is ready for writing again? How do I know if it is available for reading? I want to avoid using NIO, because that would require using SSLEngine, which seems painful to implement.
I am creating a java client/server application over TCP where we have two sockets: One is for exchanging messages. Two is for file transfer. I have created in the Server two ServerSockets in order to create Socket One and Two by accepting the ServerSockets. At first the client sends some bytes through the first Socket so that it can tell the Server which file it needs. Then the Server through the second socket sends the file to the client. After the client receives the file tries to send back to the server a Transfer Done Message. There I get the Exception for the closed socket. However I never close the socket up until now. I only close the buffer which sents the file. Even if I try to open again the socketInputStream after I sent the file the error is still the same. Also if I do not close the buffer which sents the file, the client does not get the file. Server Exception Error in Return Message - java.net.SocketException: socket closed Client Exception Server response - java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: socket write error What am I doing wrong?
I never thought of this until now, I have been using GAE for quite some time already--but never think of its memory model, since its JVM is there already, I can't say which JVM or version of JVM they are using. So my question would be when will GAE throw Heap overflow error? Or at least would break my app or whatvever the GAE will do. I don't know. For example, I push the String to the limits that I put a data with sizeof 2^31 -1 Design wise: I know this is crazy, but the idea is the same with having millions or billions or users pushing data into your GAE application, then your application's job is to process it (serialize/deserialize) before persisting. Then the heap sum of those will be huge, they might not happen all at the same time, but for sure there will be a tangent point where heap use will be huge. Is this something that GAE application have to be concered with?
I have a dynamic web project that I am working on to migrate a jsp/servlet app from JRun to Tomcat. I am getting the error: com.ibm.ivj.eab.dab.DatastoreJDBC cannot be resolved to a type. I have the *.class files sitting inside a com/ibm/ivj/eab/dab folder (exactly how I found them). I have tried creating a jar file and adding that to the build path via "Add External Jar", I have also tried adding an "External Class Folder" and pointing to the folder that contains the "com" directory in question. Still, the error persists. What is strange is if I start typing the package name eclipse actually auto-completes the class for me! (pictured below). Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Maybe the classes were compiled for a much older java version and that is causing trouble? Maybe there is something I need to do to ensure the classes end up in the WEB-INF/lib directory? I
We are willing to communicate to a C++ library developed by another team from Java. The natural and most optimal approach we've seen is using JNI, but use SWIG for simplicity during the developing time. We actually have developed the prototype and is working well. There is also a C++->Java communication after the first Java->c++ communication using SWIG Directors. The major problem we've seen is to be exposed to possible errors in C++ library, such as memory corruption and memory leaks. It seems there is no way to effectively protect against these errors. For example, executing an abort (simulating some incorrect memory operation) in C++ will kill the JVM The solution we've thought is to launch several java processes out of the parent JVM that will run in JBoss and that is what we are willing to protect. Launching java process is hard, basically because a JVM is needed to start first. In this case, the solution we've thought is to use several Nailgun servers. Each one will load a JVM ad will have access (in the classpath) to the programs we want to launch. Each JVM in each Nailgun Server (the relation is 1-1) is capable to run concurrently several executions of our program in the same JVM. If some error occurs all the executions in this Nailgun JVM will crash (but the JBoss JVM will be alive). For this reason we scheduled to have several Nailgun servers with limited number of executions and use some kind of load balancing to dispatch the executions to any of the servers. Additionally the Nailgun servers will be restarted periodically to prevent from memory leaks. We think this is a good approach to protect from C++ crashes. However we want to ask the community if there is some better approach. I forgot to mention that another solution we are considering is to have a clustered JBoss with our war for fail-over reasons. And then maybe incorporate the Nailgun server or not depending on the C++ program reliability. The benefit of a pure JBoss clustered application (without Nailgun processes) is that we will not need any kind of interprocess communication, the entire operation will be executed in a process with threads.
I have an application that loads a series of large images on startup. This is a Processing application, so most things run on the single main animation thread, and it's using Processing's OpenGL renderer. EDIT: the RuntimeException is thrown when some process within JOGL takes > 5 seconds. Making it back up the stack to subsequent loadImage() calls means the RuntimeException is avoided. I'm not clear yet how to repro this and so haven't found a way around it save the ugly try-catch + reflection workaround here. The image loads sometimes take longer than 5 seconds, and when they do, JOGL throws a RuntimeException from within RecursiveLockImpl01Unfairish.lock(). My understanding is that RecursiveLockImpl01Unfairish.lock() complains if the main GL animation thread halts execution for > 5 seconds. Is there a simple fix for this? I could shift the image loads to a different thread and reshuffle my init sequence to be more asynchronous, but that's a lot of work for something that happens only once, on application init, at a time when the application has plenty of time to start up regardless. (Note: this is for an installation, no one will be present or trying to use the application when it first launches in the morning, so a delay of many seconds on init is not a problem.)
I'm trying to generate the documentation of my android project using javadoc & doclava. I downloaded the doclava jar and I'm trying to generate the doc through Project-> generate javadoc. If I understood the mechanism, I have two ways to tell javadoc to use the doclava doclet: 1) Select "use custom doclet" with these options: Doclet name: com.google.doclava.Doclava Doclet Path: /full/path/of/my/doclava/dir/doclava-1.0.6.jar 2) Select "use standard doclet" and then, in the "javadoc options" put: -doclet com.google.doclava.Doclava -docletpath ${/full/path/of/my/doclava/dir/doclava-1.0.6.jar} I have encountered these issues: If I use the first method I can successfully generate the doc but it seems that android classes are not recognized. I get errors when doclava parses "import android.util.SparseArray" If I use the second method I get this error: "javadoc: error - Cannot find doclet class com.google.doclava.Doclava 1 error" As a matter of fact: if I don't use Doclava my documentation is correctly generated with links to the android apis. I just want to create my project javadoc with links to the android/java doc (for the android/java objects) and have an "android look & feel".
I am using the new iOS SDK and it's associated REST API. Implementing the iOS framework was a charm but when trying to verify the payments using a Java/Google App Engine backend things are less than optimal. All of this is in testing on the sandbox environment. Right now the Credit Card payment verification is working (using the REST API SDK v0.5.2) when testing locally. However, when I deploy the application to the app engine the call to com.paypal.api.payments.Payment.get(accessToken, paymentId) fails and returns the following error: Response Code : 500 with response : {"name":"DATA_RETRIEVAL","message":"Error retrieving data","information_link":"https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/#DATA_RETRIEVAL","debug_id":"b42c7f5c2b97d"} A couple more debug ids in case they help: 04870b7c20522, 9cc4393ce08b1, 3d3eb3b9109e0. The information link only contains another error message. ("Service Temporarily Unavailable - The server is temporarily unable to service your request due to maintenance downtime or capacity problems. Please try again later.") Does anyone have an idea why this fails on the App Engine? Any help would be appreciated.
I am currently working on a frontend-solution within a SOA, and I am running into troubles when saving domain-objects. The backend gives me rather big domain-objects which are also saved as a whole. The frontend on the other side splits this data into multiple pages and sub-pages. Before I share my actual problem, I'd like to give some background information: Most tasks in our system are automated, using a process-engine, talking to webservices, and a rules-engine. The frontend is only needed when the input-data is incorrect so that a person needs to correct it. Input in the frontend is saved by the webservices and when the user thinks that everything is correct he passes the domain-object back to the process-engine. A simple example for the upcoming problem Domain-Object (which is basically the root-entity) Entity 1 which is displayed on page A (as well as some fields from the root-entity) Entity 2 displayed on page B The process identifies errors in each entity and marks them. The user is given a task and the frontend loads the domain-object, displaying page A. The user corrects the fields and when he moves to page B the inputs should be saved so nothing of his work already done is lost. The Problem: the webservice responsible for saving the domain-object will throw an ValidationException because Entity 2 still has errors. You might be wondering how the incorrect data was saved in the first place? Well, the webservice exposes two services for saving, one called "automatic" and one called "manual". The operation automaticSave allowes invalid data, because the process-engine creates markers for each error that is returned. The manualSave currently doesnt allow errors. I am looking for advices how to adress this problem. I think this should be a rather common problem within a SOA. Correct me if I am wrong :-) One way would be that the data in the frontend is only stored in the session and a user has to fix all errors before he can persist, but usability-wise I think thats not the best idea. Another idea may be a partial validation on the backend, but this opens the door for incorrect data to be entered My last idea was to pass the errors that were marked by the process-engine to manualSave so that the webservice knows "hey, this field had errors before so I dont throw a ValidationException when only this is invalid" I am looking forward to your ideas. [Update] After the inital answers I've updated the structure of the domain object. It seems that this question could be extended to "How to desgin a good webservice" :-)
I'm having trouble understanding bit-wise OR in java. I'm reading a Java programming book named "Apress Beginning Java7" by Jeff Friesen. And in that book at page-31 the author gave two 8 bit binary numbers and performed bit-wise OR on those two numbers. He said that: 0B0001 1010 | 0B1011 0111 results in 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1011 1111 Then he said that and I quote: "The &, ^, and | operators in the last three lines first convert their byte integer operands to 32-bit integer values (through sign bit extension, copying the sign bit’s value into the extra bits) before performing their operations." Now if I understand correctly the first 8 bit number(0B0001 1010) by sign bit extension becomes(32bit number): 0B0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 1010 And the second number (0B1011 0111) by sign bit extension becomes: 0B1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1011 0111 If I bit-wise OR these two extended numbers I get: 0B1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1011 1111 But the author got: 0B0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1011 1111 Can anyone tell where I am wrong on this? I mean can anyone kindly tell me why my answer is different from author's and where I made the mistake?
Please correct me if this is wrong: In Java 7's try-with-resources statement, any exceptions thrown by the resource's close() method must be either declared as thrown by my method or I must wrap the whole try in another try which catches any exceptions thrown by close(). If so, I have to wonder if I will make much use of it. I certainly don't want to throw the exceptions thrown by close(), the caller won't know what to do with that. And a try wrapping another try just to handle close() would not look very elegant, to me at least. EDIT: I think I accidentally asked two questions, one of which was a duplicate. Question 1. Do I have to declare that my method throws the exception from the close() method or wrap the try-with-resources in another try? (Not answered in proposed duplicate.) Question 2. Is there a way to close the resource silently? (Clearly a duplicate, so I am taking that sentence out of the question. Hopefully this makes the question satisfactorily unique.)
I have a project where I am using a start.HTML page to invoke javascript call which inturn calls a java servlet Enquiry.java and this calls a php file myPhp.php. This php file scrapes data from a famous music site and sends data back to Enquiry.java as an XML(file or string, my choice). So, I have to have this xml data on php page making myPhp.php act like a xml file, which my servlet uses to extract data from. Now, I have to compile and run my java servlet on putty and run html on browser and do the rest. I am able to compile my file perfectly. I have set CLASSPATH to ~/tomcat/jakarta/common/lib where all jars are placed. I do >javac -classpath $CLASSPATH/servlet.jar:$CLASSPATH/json-rpc-1.0.jar Enquiry.java Compiled fine. Now, I must be having a Enquiry.class somewhere (I think in my classpath) I stop tomcat. Transfer this class file to where my .java file is. Start tomcat. Now, I need to run it. I do java -classpath $CLASSPATH/servlet.jar:$CLASSPATH/json-rpc-1.0.jar Enquiry I get: Error in "main" thread, NoClassDefFound : Enquiry I have both in current folder only. I still get a exception I want to know what is wrong? If I add a . before Enquiry, I get: Error in "main" thread, NoClassDefFound : javax.servlet.http.httpresponse exception If I add a java -cp .:$CLASSPATH... then i get: Error in "main" thread, NoClassDefFound : Main exception Please help me to resolve my classpath and run my java servlet cleanly.
My server version is as follows on my dev machine: Apache/2.2.21 (Win32) mod_fcgid/2.3.6 I have been testing HttpURLConnection as my project requires easy streaming capabilties. I have read a great synopsis from @BalusC on how to use the class. Using java.net.URLConnection to fire and handle HTTP requests The trouble I am currently having is when setting setChunkedStreamingMode. Regardless of what I set it to my stream doesn't seem to make it to the server the data stream is empty when my server api method/connection is called/made. However, if I remove it, it works fine. I have seen another person with a similar issue: Java/Android HttpURLConnection setChunkedStreamingMode not working with all PHP servers But with no real resolution. I am unable to set it to setFixedLengthStreamingMode simply because the content (json) is variable in length. This is NOT OK. I potentially will be transfering very large quantities of data and hence cannot have the data stored in memory. My question is, how can I get setChunkedStreamingMode to play nice? Is it a server setup issue or can it be fixed in code? EDIT I have now tested my code on my production server and it works no problem. I would however still like to know why my Apache server on my local machine fails. Any help is still much appreciated.
I am trying to setup a JMeter server/client instance on a remote database server. I have extracted JMeter on the server, copied the MySQL java connector into $JMETER_HOME/lib and started the JMeter-server listener. On the client (my local desktop), I have pointed the JMeterclient to the remote server (via the remote_hosts entry in $JMETER_HOME/bin/jmeter.properties). Whenever I try to run a MySQL load job on the client (Run -> Remote Start -> ), I get the following error: Response message: java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:mysql://1.2.3.4/database And this is on the server side: 2013/04/10 12:44:43 WARN - jmeter.protocol.jdbc.config.DataSourceElement: Could not return Connection java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:mysql://1.2.3.4/dbname at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:602) at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:185) at org.apache.avalon.excalibur.datasource.JdbcConnectionFactory.newInstance(JdbcConnectionFactory.java:185) at org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool.ResourceLimitingPool.newPoolable(ResourceLimitingPool.java:672) at org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool.ValidatedResourceLimitingPool.newPoolable(ValidatedResourceLimitingPool.java:178) at org.apache.avalon.excalibur.datasource.ResourceLimitingJdbcConnectionPool.newPoolable(ResourceLimitingJdbcConnectionPool.java:123) at org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool.ResourceLimitingPool.get(ResourceLimitingPool.java:402) at org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool.ValidatedResourceLimitingPool.get(ValidatedResourceLimitingPool.java:130) at org.apache.avalon.excalibur.datasource.ResourceLimitingJdbcDataSource.getConnection(ResourceLimitingJdbcDataSource.java:222) at org.apache.jmeter.protocol.jdbc.config.DataSourceElement$DataSourceComponentImpl.getConnection(DataSourceElement.java:286) at org.apache.jmeter.protocol.jdbc.config.DataSourceElement.getConnection(DataSourceElement.java:146) at org.apache.jmeter.protocol.jdbc.sampler.JDBCSampler.sample(JDBCSampler.java:85) at org.apache.jmeter.threads.JMeterThread.process_sampler(JMeterThread.java:428) at org.apache.jmeter.threads.JMeterThread.run(JMeterThread.java:256) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662) Does anyone have any idea why this wouldn't work even though the Java connector is in the jmeter lib dir?
I'm currently designing a social network on my local host, that also has a forum aspect involved. There are three things that a user can do on the site that is causing me some concern. Log in to their profile via the header from any page on the site. Post things on their wall that include links to external sites. Post in the forum a variety of different things including links to external sites, and images on external sites. Because of #1 I made the entire site https. So no matter where a user was on the site, they could log in and their entire session would be encrypted. This functionality is working great but I am afraid of Mixed Content Warnings. Right now I'm thinking twice about making the full site secure b/c if I keep it this way will mixed content warnings appear for every page that has a link to an external site, or an image from an external site? Unfortunately I have never seen this warning b/c none of the browsers I use seem to show it to me. And I searched for some kind of list of browsers that show this warning but there is no finite list that I can find. So this is awkward b/c I'm worrying and trying to avoid a thing that I've never seen. But I have thought of one solution. My current idea on how to fix the image problem is to take images from users when they post a forum and write them to my disk, and provide the new image link. I am pretty sure this is exactly how google images stays https while showing millions of images from http sites. I think they write them all to their own server. Example: https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTj_52I-TSX79mQFJRLTDNGahtGbsh_BpYDp0H3hbzJDWK2qxPZ So I think I have found a solution to the image problem but what about external links? Because when a user posts a link on their wall to https://stackoverflow.com/ for example I read the post and surround it with an anchor tag so technically to a browser wouldn't that be none secure content? Wouldn't that throw a warning? How could I fix this and not annoy my users? And do you have a better solution to my image problem? Thank you all for reading through my confusion.
I'm using Jenkins to test a Java software project (using the play web framework but that shouldn't really matter). Part of the test is about code style, for which I use checkstyle. I tried to set up my job in the following manner: I execute checkstyle via command line, which generates a report in xml checkstyle -c /usr/share/checkstyle/sun_checks.xml -f xml -r app test -o checkstyle.xml Then I add a post-build action using this Jenkins plugin, which reads the xml report and integrates into the build results So, now my problem is the following: when there are any style problems in the code, Jenkins deems the job as a failure. By default, the post-build action is not carried out in this case. One can change this, so that a report is generated nonetheless, though it still bugs me that bad code style is considered a failure. That might be subjective, I reckon. Anyway, is there a way to change this? And quite generally, how does Jenkins determine whether a command shell is a failure?
I am testing BoneCP along with other Connection pool solutions and I am having trouble getting BoneCP to work. (Using a simple Java application in Eclipse) The code I am using is copied from the BoneCP JDBC Example. Following the BoneCP Requirements I have configured the build path by importing the following external JARs: SLF4J - slf4j-jdk14-1.7.5.jar Google Guava - guava-14.0.1.jar The following is the error I get when I attempt to run the Java Application: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/LoggerFactory at com.jolbox.bonecp.BoneCPConfig.(BoneCPConfig.java:60) at Main.BoneCP(Main.java:70) at Main.main(Main.java:24) Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.slf4j.LoggerFactory at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) Any help or expertise would be appreciated.
We have a web-application deployed on Cluster environment (Weblogic 10.3.6 server) and we are replicating the session on all the nodes. We have a search Textbox where we could search for items. Sometimes I get a JSON format Error dialog on UI with this message (5 out of 10 times I see this error): DataTables Warning: JSON Data from server could not be parsed. This is caused by a JSON formatting error I get logged out of my application when I get the above error, I don't see any exceptions logged in the log files, I have checked both the Application specific log and Server logs. This happens only in clustered environment and I get the above JSON error only in clustered environment but not on single server. We Use JQuery, Spring MVC in the Presentation-tier, Should the FORM Beans used implement Serializable(java.io.Serializable) It would be great if some can guide me in the right direction
I have been trying to build jnativehook from source. I am using windows 7. I went through all the stages described on the website. Including change the environment variables Currently I am getting a build failed from the command prompt. I have pasted it below. Im not sure where the jnativehook files where supposed to extraxted too, so I have tried building the file while it is in different locations including the root directory, the java directory and inside the java folders. I checked if jni.h is anywhere in the jnativehook (jhook) files and it isnt but there is a folder called jni one step up. There is jni.h file in the java directory but it doesnt say anywhere that I have to move and files out of java to jhook directory. Does anyone know if it supposed to extracted to specific place? Also does anyone know what this error means and how to solve it? Any help appreciated : [apply] C:\jhook\src\native\common/NativeErrors.h:36:17: fatal error: jni.h : No such file or directory [apply] compilation terminated.

I am currently getting SendFailedException because my sendmail instance has some email addresses blacklisted (to filter out all emails to non-developers during testing). But SendFailedException could also indicate a failure to connect to the SMTP server or something else. When this exception occurs because the email is blacklisted, I need to ignore the message and continue, but any other exception should be allowed to propagate out of my method. When I look at the JavaMail API, it appears that SendFailedException is the lowest level of exception I can get (the last one in the javax.mail package). What I really need is is the underlying SMTPSendFailedException, but that is in the com.sun.mail package, and, as far as I understand, that means it is implementation specific and should not be used. However, that class actually has a getReturnCode() method that could be used to differentiate between SendFailedExceptions. Is there a better way to do this? Is it safe to use com.sun.mail classes? Any suggestions?
My question is what would be the best possible solution or work around for my problem? This is my problem. I am doing a 2d android game from a flash game. I have a png image with dimension 8000 x 4800. It is a sprite sheet with 10 columns and 10 rows, each frame has 800 x 480 dimension. I know it is super big size for the sprite sheet but because the flash game is super animated and has good graphics, we just exported each action/scene to png sequence to retain the animation and the quality of the graphics and to avoid the calculation of the animation. If I load the picture in android, I got the outofmemoryerror. I think it is because of the image size. I got 4 more image with the same dimension to load on the same screen. Please help me. What would be the best possible solution or work around for this.
Server errors result in HTTP 500-responses to the client with a generic error message ("The server encountered an error..."). Is there any way to intercept this message and write a custom one? I'm would like to have a way to uniquely identify a server error from the client. If I could for instance generate a GUID which I logged server-side upon a server error and then send that ID to the client, that would make it easy to search for that particular exception in the log at any point later in time. I do realize that server errors are generated by exceptions in the code, so I'm looking for some kind of catch all exception hook in the app engine API. Of course, if such a hook exists, and the code which executes here generates a second exception, it would have to default to the general 500-error again. I'm using the Java API for GAE
This is an interview question. The interview is over, but this question is still on my mind. I can't ask the interviewer, as I did not get the job. Scenario: put object of class C1 in to a cache with key "a" Later code: C1 c1FromCache = (C1) cache.get("a"); This code throws a ClassCastException. What can the reasons be? I said because someone else put another object with the same key and so overwrote it. I was told no, think of other possibilities. I said maybe the jar defining class C1 was not available on this node (not sure if this would result in a class cast or a ClassNotFoundException, but I was grasping for any lead now. Then I said maybe wrong version of class? They said the same jar of class C1 is there in all nodes). Edit/ Add Asked if the get was throwing the ClassCast but was told no. after that i told him my action to resolve such an issue would be to drop in a test jsp that would mimic the actions and put better logging (stack trace) after the exception. that was the 2nd part of the question (why and what would you do if this happened in production) Does anyone else have any ideas about why a cache get would result in a cast issue?
I'm running java with java -Xmx240g mypackage.myClass OS is Ubuntu 12.10. top says MiB Mem 245743 total, and shows that java process has virt 254g since the very beginning, and res is steadily increasing up to 169g. At that point it looks like it starts garbage collect a lot, I think so because the program is single-threaded at that point, and CPU% is mostly 100% up to this point, and it jumps around 1300-2000 at this point (I conclude it is multithreaded garbage collector), and then res slowly moves to 172g. At that point java crashes with Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at the line with new double[2000][5] java -version says java version "1.7.0_15" OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea7 2.3.7) (7u15-2.3.7-0ubuntu1~12.10) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode) Hardware is Amazon cr1.8xlarge instance It seems to me that java crashes even when there's a lot of memory available. It is clearly not possible, I have to interpret some numbers wrong. Where should I look to understand what's going on? Edit: I don't specify any GC options. The only command-line option is -Xmx240g My program is successfully working on many inputs, and top said sometimes that it uses up to 98.3% of memory. However I reproduced the situation described above with certain program input. Edit2: This is scientific application. It has gigantic tree (1-10 millions of nodes), in each node there are couple double arrays with size approx. 300x3 - 900x5. After initial tree creation program does not allocate much memory. Most of the time there are some arithmetic operations going on with these arrays. Edit3: HotSpot JVM died the same way, used CPU a lot at 170-172g mark and crashed with the same error. Looks like 70-75% of memory is some magical line that JVM does not want to cross. Final solution: With -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:NewRatio=12 program made it through 170g mark and is happily working further.
I am using RHEL 6.0 with JRE1.6.0_43 installed. It's installed properly and java plugin for browser also working fine. But I am facing the problem while running java_vm in /jre/bin directory. While running for the first time it throws, java_vm process: You need to set both JAVA_HOME and PLUGIN_HOME Then i set the JAVA_HOME=/ and PLUGIN_HOME=/plugin, after that it throws the following exception while running java_vm, java_vm process: Couldn't find class sun/plugin/navig/motif/Plugin Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: sun/plugin/navig/motif/Plugin Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: sun.plugin.navig.motif.Plugin at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) Then i modified the PLUGIN_HOME=/ , when i try to run again it shows another exception, Java process: caught exception from sun.plugin.navig.motif.Plugin.start Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException at sun.plugin.navig.motif.Plugin.start(Unknown Source) After this, I don't know what to do to get rid of this problem... I think the problem is with PLUGIN_HOME variable.. Please provide me the clear details about PLUGIN_HOME and tell me why we need this variable?
I have the following problem: I created ~100 MB file using R by exporting as a graph (hence I can re-export if necessary) I would need to open it in gephi (0.8.2) the file includes ~2.6k nodes, ~170k edges and every node has several attributes. I have reduced all the attributes to only the necessary ones, but Gephi still won't open. I am running a laptop with 4 GB memory (I have shutdown everything unnecessary) and I have Java 64bit. Yet, I still get the following problem: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index5, Size: 5 I do not think it is a memory issue like I had before, I still have plenty (at least ~600 MB) free memory even at the most problematic point. The config file is set to : Xmx2827m The file currently is exported as GML, but I can use any format igraph can export to. So any solution that would allow me to open the file in gephi including the nodes, edges and attributes would be welcome. I picked GML because it seemed smallest file format that supports attributes. Any ideas? Thank you very much for your time!
I see that one definition can be this: Generally RuntimeExceptions are exceptions that can be prevented programmatically. But that is still not the definition of a checked exception. I thought checked exceptions were "exceptions that can be handled at compile-time". Is that correct and/or can you tell me more? I also read this on the site, can you explain the quote? Many people say that checked exceptions (i.e. these that you should explicitly catch or rethrow) should not be used at all. Java: checked vs unchecked exception explanation Can I just learn what the definition is? I also read somewhat unexpectedly: NumberFormatException is unchecked` But I would think that NumberFormatException is checked since I would handle that at compile-time. Can you please help me understand? I've done some Java programming but I never wrote my own exception class, why would I need that? Update A definition is given is the SCJP book by Sierra / Bates:
My company uses an applet which needs JNI to access some PKI features. This is a very stable (+4 years) solution and is already in production in several clients. It's a signed (Thawte Certificate) applet and it worked fine until JRE7 21 - now a security exception has popped (all Applet JNI solutions we have are presenting the same issue). I checked Java applet stopped working after update to JRE 7u21 and Cannot launch applet using Java 7u21. I've checked Java 7 Update 21 Security Improvements in Detail, but it doesn't mention anything about JNI. I've already tried using TurstedLibrary and recompiling it with JDK7 21 but it still pops the security exception. I'd like to check with you guys if you had the same issue and if someone is able to use Java + JNI again (don't know if there's some new stuff to sign the DLL or something like that).. Update: Working - got it through http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/mixed_code.html#trusted_library Adding the correct Trusted Library manifest make it stop prompting the error - remembering that you need to use JDK7 21.
I have a signed applet on my website that had been working fine for nearly a year. Today, however, it's giving my users a mixed code warning. I found here that certain Apache components, which I happen to be using, can generate a mixed code warning. However, there are two things that concern me. First of all, my applet consists of a single jar file that's signed, and when I use jarsigner -verify my_signed_file.jar I get the jar verified output. (It's not linking to any external libraries, all of the compiled code is inside this jar file.) I'm getting this message all of a sudden, even though the my applet jar hasn't been modified in nearly a year. Both I and my client have been using the Java 1.7 runtime for a while now without getting this message, so why would we be getting the message today? Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated. Thank you. --Jay
I know that there are many questions on this topic, and I have been searching for an answer for the past 4 months. Everyone says check host address, port, and firewall. Well I have done these items, but am still not having any success. We are running our web application locally using Apache Tomcat 7.0.27 through Netbeans 7.2.1 and are no longer able to connect to the SMTP server to send emails. When running the application on a virtual machine located on the server, there is no issue connecting. We have no problem connecting and sending mail using telnet locally with the same parameters. We have tried looking at the SMTP logs on the server, and were able to access some logs, but can't find any related to the refused connection. Which SMTP logs would provide more information on this issue? I tend to think that since the connection is refused it may not even trigger any logging, is this a correct assumption? We migrated to IIS7 several months ago and were having trouble accessing IIS 6.0 Manager, so I am not sure that they are even set up correctly. Does anyone have any ideas of how to further troubleshoot the connection? Thank you in advance, and please let me know if I can provide any further information.
I am writing an educational program for students, where they can see how different algorithms work when solving Traveling salesman problem (Time consumption, visual representation of state etc.). The problem is that not only I have to show good algorithms but I have to show bad ones as well. For instance I implement Breadth-first search algorithm for TSP (horrible choice). Program itself is written in Java. I have a seperate thread for problem solver algorithm and all algorithms implement a specific interface which allows me to interfere after each iteration. All blind-search algoritms which run over a tree structure with N nodes (n= number of cities) and each node is an array of N elements, that implementation produces a StackOverFlow Exception after around generating ~ 50k nodes. I dont want to limit user interface so that limited ammount of cities can be used- simulated anneal works with thousands of cities. Here is the question: Is there some reliable function I could use in some specified logical statement so that I could identify the point when System is about to crash? Something is style : if (System.memoryLeft() <= 100 /bytes/ ) { // Stop working and take action Thanks in advance.
UPDATE: The error codes here is not such a return value of a function. Actually I am not discussing using exception or error codes for error handling. I am trying to figure out, using what pattern to organize errors. What I am really doing is like error codes showing on Windows blue screen. Back to the very old time, when your Windows crash you can get an error code on blue screen, using that code you can figure out what's going on by looking up MS's document. In my system, there are many plugins contributed by different people that may not know each other. If I allow them to define their error codes. It's mostly like error code of two plugins may conflict. ================================================================================================ I want to design an extendable error codes system that allows plugins to define their own error codes. The basic idea is: system has a range of reserved error codes plugin can select a range that not used by system, then creates its error codes in that range. However, the problem is plugins don't know each other(because plugins may be written by different people and installed into system by user's preference). so their error codes range may conflict. Is there any good practice for this requirement? I google a lot but to my surprise, there are very few articles talking about designing error codes in production software. Most posts are focus on exception vs error code. And, is there any good pattern for showing error in product that user could figure out what's going on? My basic idea is to show user an error which has error code, descriptions, details. And user could click the error code then I would show him the proper solution
I essentially have some objects in this configuration (the real data model is a bit more complex): A has a many-to-many relationship with B. (B has inverse="true") B has a many-to-one relationship with C. (I have cascade set to "save-update") C is a kind of type/category table. Also, I should probably mention that the primary keys are generated by the database on save. With my data, I sometimes run into problems where A has a set of different B objects, and these B objects refer to the same C object. When I call session.saveOrUpdate(myAObject), I get a hibernate error saying: "a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session: C". I know that hibernate can't insert/update/delete the same object twice in the same session, but is there some way around this? This doesn't seem like it would be that uncommon of a situation. During my research of this problem, I have seen folks suggest the use of session.merge(), but when I do that, any "conflicting" objects get inserted into the database as blank objects with all values set to null. Clearly that isn't what we want. [Edit] Another thing I forgot to mention is that (for architectural reasons beyond my control), each read or write needs to be done in a separate session.
Let me brief what am I trying to achieve. I want to override the method EntityManager.persist() which is used in apache JUDDI for one of my requirements. Hence I thought of overriding the default openjpa persistence provider impl class with a wrapper class which will inside directly use corresponding org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl methods.(this is very same as MyPersistenceProvider extends PersistenceProviderImpl ) . I added the custom persistence provider in persistence.xml. At startup I found the log saying INFO: Found persistence provider "org.test.uddi.persistance.CustomPersistenceProviderImpl". OpenJPA will not be used. Which means my class gets picked as the provider. But $subject occurs. Any idea why ? Following is the full stacktrace. [2013-04-29 13:32:22,470] INFO {org.wso2.carbon.core.deployment.DeploymentInterceptor} - Deploying Axis2 service: UDDIReplicationService {super-tenant} INFO: Found persistence provider "org.test.uddi.persistance.CustomPersistenceProviderImpl".

Before anyone says anything I'm asking this out of curiosity only; I'm not planning to do any premature optimization based off of this answer. My question is about speed in using reflection and casting. The standard saying is 'reflection is slow'. My question is what part exactly is slow, and why; particularly in comparing if something is a parent of another instance. I'm pretty confident that just comparing the class of an object to another Class object is about as fast as any comparison, presumably just doing direct comparison of singleton objects that are already stored int he Object's state; but what if one class is a parent of the other? I usually think of instanceof as being about as fast as regular class checking, but today I thought about it and it seems that some reflection has to happen 'under the scenes' for instanceof to work. I checked online and found a few places where someone said instanceof is slow; presumably due to reflection required to compare the parent of an object? This lead to the next question, what about just casting. If I cast something as an object it's not I get a ClassCastException. But this doesn't happen if a cast an object to a parent of itself. Essentially I'm doing an instanceof call, or logic to that effect, when I do the cast at run time am I not? I've never heard anyone hint that casting an object could be slow before. Admittedly not all casts are to a parent of the provided object, but plenty of casts are to parent classes. Yet never has anyone hinted at all that this could be slow. So which is it. Is instanceof really not that slow? Are both instanceof and casting to parent class kind of slow? or is there some reason a cast can be done faster then an instanceof call?
I'm getting this exception when restarting my GWT server. I can't find any information on this exception that pertains to a server reload. The exception doesn't seem to cause any problems but it's starting to annoy me. The other developers in my office running the same GWT client and server code don't have this problem on their work stations. Does anybody have any ideas about what could be causing this?

I wrote a bash script to auto-deploy a web-application to tomcat container whenever it is triggered. It is pretty straight-forward: Dump the current database for back-up Shutdown the current tomcat process Delete the web-application folder Replace the war file with the new one Start tomcat again However, now I want to have a fall-back. If there's some problem in start-up process, the database will get restored and the old war file is deployed again. My problem is that I don't know when a web-application failed to start. One of my implementation is that I will check the size of the logging file of my web application, if after a while it doesn't increase (which means there's nothing get written), then the system should understand that deployment is failed and we should restore the old web-application. However, this is kind of dirty and I'm not sure what will happen if my logging file get rolled right at that time. Does tomcat has any mechanism to support start-failed detection of a web-application?
I'm working on an batch application right now that utilizes a class to email out any errors caught during runtime so that the support team will know the batch failed immediately. Basically, the entire batch process is kicked off using a run method in my launcher class. The run method has a try/catch block that will send the email if any exceptions make it back to the launcher class without being handled. Is there a way to test my email functionality utilizing Eclipse's debugging tools? I would like to kick off the application then have a way to just throw an uncaught exception so I can see the email show up in my inbox. I don't want to put a throw statement in my code, because I really don't want to make the method use the "throws" tag. I am hoping that I can use the debugger to pause the app and then somehow just tell Eclipse to throw the app an exception. Is this possible?
I have written a program which I used Java Media Framework (JMF) Library to capture video from camera and display the video, when I run the program in Eclipse it work will, but when I export the program as runnable jar file, then the program cannot detect the device. I have done some experiment which I will share with you below. I installed JFM in C drive and I add the libraries from C drive to Eclipse (C:\Program Files\JMF2.1.1e\lib) in this case the program run from Eclipse working will, but when I copied the libraries from (C:\Program Files\JMF2.1.1e\lib) to inside the project in Eclipse, then the same problem happen which cannot detect the device. Now I don’t know how to solve this problem, if anyone knows about this can suggest me. Thanks in Advance! I have tried all below three options to export, but the same problem happened: But when I select the first option then Eclipse warn as below:
It sometimes happens when I'm working on a project that I suddenly get problems with running the program. When I press the keyboard shortcut for running as a Java application, I get the error message "Selection does not contain a main type". Also, the option Run -> Run As -> Java Application has disappeared from the menu. I CAN, however, run the application by selecting the appropriate command in the menu Run -> Run History, or by running it in debug mode. I can also solve the problem (temporarily, until the next time it appears) by restarting Eclipse. So it seems likely that this is a bug in Eclipse. I've searched SO and the web for the same problem, but only found examples of people actually forgetting the main class etc.. To emphasize, I don't need to change anything in the code or any settings in Eclipse to fix the problem. Any idea of why this problem appears, what I can do to prevent it and/or more convenient ways of solving it (restarting Eclipse takes a while) would be much appreciated! (Additional info as follows. I have no idea if this has anything to do with anything or if it is any help: The last time the problem appeared, the CTRL key had just stopped working. Curiously, only in Eclipse and only in one editor tab. Closing and reopening the relevant class tab solved the problem but introduced the "main class not found"-error. This error only affects one project at a time: other projects run perfectly fine)
The problem I'm facing is a very simple one... I can't get IntelliJ IDEA 12 to help me with the creation of an Android application module (project). After successfully installing IntelliJ IDEA 12 and making acquaintance between the IDE and both SDKs (Java and Android), when I run the "New Module wizard" and choose "Android application module" I receive an error message which states: "Cannot find resource directory for module < blah >" The IDE does not hang, or crash but I'm left with a half Android project which does not contain the mandatory file structure of any (straight forward, recommended) Android application. Amongst other things: the "res" folder is missing and so is the activity which the wizard asked me about and then there's no AndroidManifest.xml Here's what the IDEA 12 Wizard creates: and here's what the structure of the project should look like (in this particular case it's the work of an Eclipse - Android integration from a colleague's machine): I've replicated the problem several times and it always happened in the same way. It looks like something's broken in there and I've looked all over the Internet for an answer before finally deciding to ask this question. I'm sure that all the required files and folders could be created manually but I would like the IDE to help me with this boilerplate stuff since I'm a beginner with Android development and there may be other things not working, behind the scenes, it this is the symptom. In other words, I feel it would be very important for the wizard to create a working Hello World project. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
I'm really a newbie to JUnit and unit testing in general and I'm struggling to find the right approach. What is the better way to deal with unexpected exceptions, and why? Method A: first catch the expected ones, fail the test with a message in the last catch block, catch a general Exception and fail the test with some "Unexpected exception has occured" message Method B: catch only the expected ones, fail with a message mark the test method with throws Exception and let anything unexpected "bubble up" completely out of the test And to add to the confusion, by saying "unexpected exception", I mean either one of these things: an exception that the method being tested claims to throw, but on in this case. For example, my method throws IllegalArgumentException and NullPointerException, but in this try block, I expect it to throw IllegalArgument; NullPointer is considered unexpected. Catch and fail or bubble up? a general Exception I really cannot anticipate I'm aware this question comes out a bit confusing, I'm getting lost in it myself, but hopefully someone will give me any kind of hint. Won't blame you for downvotes, it's still worth the risk :)
I'm looking for a lightweight way of embedding some GUI-based object inspection facilities in a Java application. Ideally it would be something like the variable inspector in the Eclipse debugger, which lets you see all the fields of a given object instance, and drill down to inspect fields contained within these. Doesn't have to be pretty, just needs to have a way to inspect the value of all fields I don't just want to use a debugger: this idea is that the facility can be used on the application at runtime, allowing for quick diagnostics without restarting the application. It needs to be pretty lightweight: since this is meant to be embedded in a deployed application, I don't want to pull in a whole load of extra dependencies. So Swing would be OK, but pulling in a whole native widget library would be out of the question (sorry, no SWT....) It needs to be able to inspect an arbitrary Java/JVM object (presumably via reflection) Does anyone know a tool like this?
Why IOException after thousands of socket creation calls? I did a simple Server code (Java) which accepts connections then creates a thread reads the socket and sends back another character to the Client The Client code starts to do a cycling (long enough to reproduce the issue) and in each cycle creates 50 threads in each thread creating a client socket to server machine and sends a character then reads from socket the character that the Server sends back. Then both the Client and the Server closes the socket. After a while I notice that on Client side I get exception in client socket creation. Are there some limitations which I should take in consideration to work this properly or this should work in an infinite loop? I'm thinking here to situations that maybe after a long enough cycling time the client side tries to bind the new socket to a port on client machine which is still binded to a socket which is in CLOSED state but that time period which needs to be elapsed to be freed by kernel not passed yet. (sorry don't know official name of this time period) The client and server machines are two Linux systems in VMware.
I downloaded Android Studio and attempted to launch the program. This is running on Windows 7 64-bit with Java 1.7. During the installation my Java 1.7 is detected, and the rest of the installation goes through just fine. However, when attempting to launch the application from the desktop icon, nothing happens. Looking at the task manager, a new process from the CMD is loaded. This is because it's attempting to run the batch file studio.bat. When I execute via CMD, I get the following error: ERROR: cannot start Android Studio. No JDK found. Please validate either ANDROID_STUDIO_JDK, or JDK_HOME or JAVA_HOME points to valid JDK installation. ECHO is off. Press any key to continue . . . I've attempted to open the idea properties file to see if there was something I could configure for this ANDROID_STUDIO_JDK or something like that. However, I found nothing. I hope some of you can let me know if you were able to install this or if you are having problems as well.
I'm facing a DatabaseLessLeasing issue. Our's is a middleware application. We don't have any database and our application is running on WebLogic server. We have 2 servers in one cluster. Both servers are up and running, but we are using only one server to do the processing. When the primary server fails, whole server and services will migrate to secondary server. This is working fine. But we had one issue end of last year that our secondary server hardware was down and secondary server was not available. We got the below issue. When we went to Oracle, they suggested to have one more server or have one database which is high availability to hold the cluster leasing information to point out which is the master server. As of now we don't have that option to do as putting the new server means there will be a budget issue and client is not ready for it. Our Weblogic configuration for cluster are: one cluster with 2 managed servers cluster messaging mode is Multicast Migration Basis is Consensus load algorithm is Round Robin This is the log I found LOG: Critical Health BEA-310006 Critical Subsystem DatabaseLessLeasing has failed. Setting server state to FAILED. Reason: Server is not in the majority cluster partition> Critical WebLogicServer BEA-000385 Server health failed. Reason: health of critical service 'DatabaseLessLeasing' failed Notice WebLogicServer BEA-000365 Server state changed to FAILED **Note: **I remember one thing, the server was not down when this happened. Both the servers were running but all of a sudden server tried to restart and it unable to restart. Restart was failed. I saw that status was showing as failedToRestart and application went down. Can anyone please help me on this issue. Thank you
I'm looking for an open source Java Job Scheduler that allows sending different kind of jobs (not only flop intensive) and distributes them across many machines. It should also monitor the jobs and retry on different nodes should any job fail or the slave node crash. I would also appreciate load balancing similar to OpenMP or MPI. Ideally you should be able to pass in a Job dependency graph and the jobs will be processed in a topological-ordered fashion and parallelization should be done where possible. The closest match I know to this is Quartz but this only allows scheduling single jobs by time and there is no remoting, failover, load balancing and dependency handling capabilities. Such solution could be built on top of Quartz and a MOM server e.g. ActiveMQ but I'd like to be sure there is nothing out there first before building this up. Probably a MapReduce port to Java would also do.
I want to create a fresh android application project in eclipse But when I try to create a project it every time gives me the message on the first screen of creation.

I am developing a web server in java as part of my study; the server has model logic. I am looking for method to send specific error messages to the client. To do so, the deeper layer of the logic should return some class with the error. The current implementation is like that: BaseResponse - abstract class that all other response inherit from it. ErrorResponse - this is the response class that has the specific error message. This method is very limiting, because if in the upper layers of the logic I want to see if the request was successful or not, I should check the type, and then cast the response to the correct class. for example: layer 1: ServiceApi.login(username, pass) layer 2: system.login(username, pass) layer 3: userManager.login(username, pass) the userManager is the one that actually does the login logic, then if I in layer 2 want to check if it was successful or not, I should do the casting and instance checking. so, I am looking for method that in the layers I will get the object themselves (and not response) and still for the client return the specific error messages.
I have an app that do simple CRUDs ops (Create, read, update, delete with MySQL). This app is with maven & hibernate. Everything is fine when I debug and execute the app into the IDE (eclipse). But I need to create a jar of this app, I tried and when I execute the new .jar file looks that everything is ok. The real problem is when I execute any action for example insert a new record. I fill the textfields and click into the button to save... but DON'T DO NOTHING! The app only display the GUI but don't do nothing, don't save, don't update don't delete. What is wrong? exist any special guide to create a .jar file with hibernate? What should do? ---------------Update------------- Well I did many thing I created the .jar file with the shell and looks ok I create the manifest and is ok but is the same problem when I launch the .jar from shell show me this: Could not initialize the database. java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver Looks like the jar cannot found the classpath to mysqulconnector.jar... but is weird because I declare it in the manifest "Class-Path: connector.jar" I dont know how do it. What should do "attach" or declare the jar to connect to db?
I have a Java application with several (10) packages and almost 50 classes. My task is to understand the application (with poor documentation and no test cases). The application seem to have several bugs that I need to correct. So, I have started reverse engineering it and developing test cases based on the understanding. At times, I am using the test cases to understand the application itself. In this process , I am using JUnit test suit. I am also using the Eclipse Scrapbook, which to me is a very handy tool. I am testing small snippets of code using the scrapbook. As there are several packages and classes, I want to preserve all the small tests that I am doing using the scrapbook. My question is regarding the organization of the scrapbook(s) for large applications and the common practice. Is it a common practice to create separate scrapbooks (like Junit test case for each class and methods) for each package ? I am looking for guidelines that is followed in industry.
All of the tutorials/links/articles I have found for debugging GWT involve: Using the Google-Eclipse plugin; and Running GWT in Development Mode from inside Eclipse (with Eclipse as the web container) I would like to know how to debug a GWT app while it runs from a non-Eclipse web container; specifically a full-blown Tomcat instance that is either running on the same machine (localhost:8080) or on a remote machine somewhere else. Ideally, I'd be able to access my app normally, via browser, but as I interact with the app (clicking buttons, etc.), Eclipse would be running in Debug mode, and would hit breakpoints that I set ahead of time (before the deploy). To my surprise, there isn't much out there on this that I could find, and certainly nothing definitive. So I was wondering if any battle-weary GWT veterans could shed some light on how I could do this. If at all possible, I'd prefer not to install the Google-Eclipse plugin, unless that is the only option for achieving this. Thanks in advance!
I have followed the tutorial in facebook.com concerning how to integrate facebook into android applications. I have downloaded facebooksdk and imported the projects to a clean workspace on Eclipse. However after I have imported them , I got about 150 errors about "can not be resolved to a variable". Among the samples there is also a FacebookSDK project that is imported. I assume that is the real library to be used for other samples ?. I have looked into the details. HEre is what I have found : FacebookSDK project doesnt have any library path problems. However, all other sample projects tries to find facebooksdk.jar in the bin folder of facebook project. And there is no such file. Also, I have not found a single thing about a facebooksdk.jar in google. -The errors concerning FacebookSDK project are as follows : R can not be resolved to a variable. -The errors concerning Other sample projects are as follows : Some resolving issues with imported functions and classes. I appreciate any advice. Thank you.
I'm trying to learn web development using Java. I have to mention, I didn't open a new project, I'm working on an existing one and trying to add pages to it. I am using netbeans IDE 7.2.1 to create a servlet. I also use Struts2. I right-click on a the package in which I want to create the servlet in, New, Servlet. Then a popup window appears to prompt me for the Class Name, location, etc. At the bottom of the popup, it says in red: Invalid deployment descriptor web.xml And doesn't allow me to continue. When I opened my web.xml file I could not see anything which might seems to be related to my issue. Can someone please help? Edit: I am really a newbie :) Sorry about the silly questions. When I run this page, I get the error page of our website, meaning ( I assume ) it look the file somewhere and is not being able to find it. Thank you again...
Background So I've inherited an android application that in various places connects to web services to send or receive information. As it is right now, when a connection fails the user of the android device is prompted with an error message that for most users are viewed as obscure. The problem So what I'm looking for is a pattern or suggestion on how to implement a solution in this android application that catches all java connection exceptions and presents a dialog telling the user he lost the internet connection and needs to try again. Any ideas? :-) Edit, current idea My current idea to solve this issue, or making it a bit more managed instead of having a fractured exception handling that takes care of the problem at every possible connection is this. Each communication instance/class will inherit from a super class, or implement an interface that forces this class to be used. This class contains the logic for connection exceptions. Lets just for now call it ConnectionExceptionManager. The problem then only becomes implementation of this in each communication class in each web service call. In each web service calls exception I need to check for communication exceptions and if it hits, use the ConnectionExceptionManager in this catch. This would however still make it a hassle, to copy into request method in each communication class. Any ideas about improving this current idea of mine?
In [java.util.Collections][1] in Java SE 6, it says: The "destructive" algorithms contained in this class, that is, the algorithms that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to throw UnsupportedOperationException if the collection does not support the appropriate mutation primitive(s), such as the set method. These algorithms may, but are not required to, throw this exception if an invocation would have no effect on the collection. For example, invoking the sort method on an unmodifiable list that is already sorted may or may not throw UnsupportedOperationException. Why does it specify that the unsupported methods "may" throw an exception, instead of just saying they will throw? I misunderstood reading this paragraph, I thought it was saying that methods on objects returned by Collections may throw if they are unsupported. It's really talking about the methods in the Collections class. So this question is invalid. Please close/delete this question as it provides no value.
I have two Java programs that are scheduled to run one after the other. When they run in sequence without an overlap, there are no issues. But sometimes one of them gets prolonged a little while more due to the volume it is processing and the second one starts before the first one ends. Now, when this happens at a point when the second one is half way through completion it crashes giving the Max no of files open exception. The first one finishes successfully though. When run separately, with the same volume, there are no issues with either of them. Both processes are completely independent of each other - no common resources, invoked from different scripts and are finally 2 different processes running on the same OS on 2 different JVM's - I use a HP-UNIX system and have tried to trace the open handles using the TUSC utility but there aren't any that could cause such a problem. Xmx is 2Gigs for both and I doubt that would be reached - but is there an explanation to this that I am not seeing? Can the parallel runs be an issue or is it just a coincidence?

I am trying to run a Java application that connects to a MS SQL Server 2008 database. The application was always worked fine when run from a 32-bit machine. The MS SQL database is and will remain on a 32-bit machine. Only the java code is being moved to a 64-bit machine. Now I have to migrate the java code to a 64-bit machine. I got by the expected mismatched architecture errors by building the code with the 64 bit Java JVM, and using the 64-bit version of the SQL Native Client data source/driver. Now, I am left with the error in the title, Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Invalid string or buffer length. I also installed the 32-bit JVM and SQL Native Client 10 on the 64 bit machine, and tried to run that way, and still a no go. Will it be a problem, no matter what I do, to try to run a java app from a 64-bit machine that is trying to talk with MS SQL database on a different machine that is a 32-bit? Thanks!! Alex
I created a simple "Hello, World" Android app. Then I checked for updates in Eclipse. A lot of updates were installed. After installing them and restarting Eclipse I got an error in my Android app. The main activity page is not loaded and I see the message Unable to resolve target 'android-16' until the SDK is loaded. If I click Window->Preferences and navigate to "Android", it shows me "No target available". I remember, that before that, there was something there instead of "No target available". I found out that during the update file "adb.exe" was moved from C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk to C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools. I tried to change the directory in the properties (Window->Preferences) to ...\platform-tools, but it gave me the message Could not find folder 'tools' in ... The Android SDK manager fails to launch. When I click Window->Android SDK Manager, it says Starting ... but nothing happens afterwards. At Stackoverflow I found several questions regarding this problem. BUT none of the solutions worked for me. Here is the list of similar questions solutions to which didn't help me: Android Problem: Eclipse cannot find ADB.exe Could not find adb.exe - after upgrade to Android SDK 2.3 Unable to set up Android Target in Eclipse Could not find folder 'tools' inside SDK Please help me to solve this problem!

I am trying to use the spring data binding classes to use in my own framework, which is non-spring-mvc based. In this I override the DataBinder and the AbstractBindingResult classes. When the user is editing the object, validation can occur, which will run through the binder, which will validate the whole object. However, once the the user edits one field/value, a whole new result isn't needed, only the specific field/value needs to be revalidated. Luckily, I can extend the default implementations for that. What I can't seem to do is clean up old errors for that specific field, because the errors list is rendered add-only by the AbstractBindingResult implementation. So my questions are: Is there a way to clean up errors that I am missing? Is there a reason why this implementation is chosen? Do people have other suggestions how to do this? Perhaps pick another validation framework, or just take the AbstractBindingResult code and rewrite it?

In a Java project, I'm using Sonar with Maven and it's work fine with "sonar way" profile. But when switching to the "Sonar way with Findbugs" profile, it fails : "Can not execute Sonar: Can not execute Findbugs: Findbugs needs sources to be compiled. Please build project before executing sonar and check the location of compiled classes." The project is correctly build before the execution of Sonar. But the root module / project doesn't contains any classes. So target/classes is empty My project is composed of several modules and a root pom.xml Project |_ Module 1 |_ Module 2 |_ Module 3 pom.xml Sonar is running fine for every modules and try to analyze the root project but this one doesn't contains any classes so it fails. Is there a way to exclude the root project / module (exclude root module is not possible) or tell sonar to only generate a warning in this case or another solution? Thanks in advance.
I am making a basic lexical analyser in Java for my semester project and I am at conflict on a concept with my subject teacher. My view is that in general if an input like "1a" is given to lexical analyser then it should give output as: "<Number><Identifier>" But, my teacher says that it should flag this as an error because instead of treating it as a number and a identifier it should flag the whole string(i.e. "1a") as an error.This is because(as he says) identifiers cannot start with a number. On the contrary I think this should be the responsibility of next stage of compiler(syntax analyser) to decide if something is a valid identifier or not. I know he is right about identifiers not starting with a number but I need closure on the part that the lexical analyser should be the one deciding that. I will really appreciate your help. Thank you
I have recently implemented OpenID login using Google on my project. I used this tutorial to get familiar with the library. It wouldn't work in my project, when the login form was submitted a request ended up at my authentication controller, rather than redirecting to Google. After hours of stripping my project down to nothing I found the problem, when I have spring-integration-core on the classpath it does not work. Investigating this problem I downloaded the source for the example, adding spring-integration-core to the dependency list causes the same problem I was getting. Ideally I would like to use spring-integration in my project, and therefore help to get to the bottom of this would be appreciated. I get the same problem with a combination of spring-security 3.0.5 and 3.1.3, and spring-integration-core 2.2.0 and 2.2.3. The dependency hierarchy looks ok to me (there are not any obvious conflicting spring versions).
Our open source app targets the Java 6 platform so we compile with the -source 1.6 and -target 1.6 options but when using JDK 7, we get this warning message, e.g. For example: $ javac -source 1.6 -target 1.6 test.java warning: [options] bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 1.6 We can resolve the problem by using the -bootclasspath for our machines, but we distribute our app as a source tarball/zip and our users build it on their machines. Additionally, we DO NOT want to require user to download JDK6 just so they don't get this warning so the -bootclasspath option is not a good solution. Of course we verify that we use only JDK 6 APIs, by using and testing JDK 6. So we would just like to suppress this warning when using JDK 7 to compile our source code. I have scan through the javac options but cannot find out how to suppress this warning. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/javac.html Any ideas on how to do suppress JDK 7's bootstrap class path warning when targeting Java 6? For now we just tell our users to ignore this but ideally, we don't want any warnings print at all.
In my spring MVC I use @ResponseBody annotation to create the JSON object & I use AJAX & jquery for query & parsing the data. Everything works great but we figured out that when our bean object (the one in controller) which we receive from a library changes we have no control over it inside the JSP because it won't provide any compilation error & because we just use Jquery to parse our JSON. this has made us worry because our bean object may change frequently. right now these solution came to our mind: 1) when the request came to our controller method, we just use ServletDispatcher to make the content somewhere else (another jsp) & return it back to the user. (This is bad because we have to use row Servlet code inside Spring framework ) 2) (trick) we call getter methods of our object inside our controller method & when the content of that object changed, It leads to compilation error inside the controller method. Do you have any idea or solution that leads to compilation error when the bean object inside the controller change or is there any specific Spring method to solve this problem ?
I'm currently working on a webservice running on a glassfish 3.1.2-server to which I only have remote deployment access. The route is basically like this: I develop the webservice on a locally running glassfish server -> I create a war-file with all the needed dependencies -> I deploy the war-file to a remote svn-directory I have write-access to -> the remote glassfish fetches the svn-war-files and deploys them -> I can now run them over HTTP-URLs. This works okay when my local configuration roughly matches everything on the remote server, however now a few problems have started arising - the local webservice runs perfectly, the remote does not. Instead of getting the wsdl when calling ?wsdl, I get a "resource not available" error. So my question is: Is there any way I can force the webservice to redirect the caller of the url with the param ?wsdl onto an error-page detailing the exception? I'm currently calling java.util.logging, but since I have no access onto the logs that's no help.
I am making HTTP requests too frequently and after some time getting this Exception: java.net.SocketException: recvfrom failed: ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out) I have gone through all of this related post. But I don't get how to solve this. They have mentioned to clear the DNS cache, but I need to clear it in runtime, so that my execution does not stop working, which is not possible in Android. Can anybody tell me the solution. Here is my log: 06-04 11:14:08.119: W/System.err(8338): java.net.SocketException: recvfrom failed: ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at libcore.io.IoBridge.maybeThrowAfterRecvfrom(IoBridge.java:552) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at libcore.io.IoBridge.recvfrom(IoBridge.java:516) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.read(PlainSocketImpl.java:489) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.access$000(PlainSocketImpl.java:46) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at java.net.PlainSocketImpl$PlainSocketInputStream.read(PlainSocketImpl.java:241) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.io.AbstractSessionInputBuffer.fillBuffer(AbstractSessionInputBuffer.java:103) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.io.AbstractSessionInputBuffer.readLine(AbstractSessionInputBuffer.java:191) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultResponseParser.parseHead(DefaultResponseParser.java:82) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.io.AbstractMessageParser.parse(AbstractMessageParser.java:174) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.AbstractHttpClientConnection.receiveResponseHeader(AbstractHttpClientConnection.java:180) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultClientConnection.receiveResponseHeader(DefaultClientConnection.java:235) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.conn.AbstractClientConnAdapter.receiveResponseHeader(AbstractClientConnAdapter.java:259) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.protocol.HttpRequestExecutor.doReceiveResponse(HttpRequestExecutor.java:279) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.protocol.HttpRequestExecutor.execute(HttpRequestExecutor.java:121) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector.execute(DefaultRequestDirector.java:428) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient$1.executeRequestSending(AbstractHttpClient.java:608) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.naf.redirect.NafRequestExecutorWrapperRedirectionHandler.executeRequestSendingUsual(NafRequestExecutorWrapperRedirectionHandler.java:96) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.naf.redirect.NafRequestExecutorWrapperRedirectionHandler.executeRequestSending(NafRequestExecutorWrapperRedirectionHandler.java:73) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.naf.auth.NafHttpAuthStrategyDefault.sendFirstRequest(NafHttpAuthStrategyDefault.java:488) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.naf.auth.NafHttpAuthStrategyDefault.performAuthExecutionUnsafe(NafHttpAuthStrategyDefault.java:389) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.naf.auth.NafHttpAuthStrategyDefault.performAuthExecution(NafHttpAuthStrategyDefault.java:200) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.execute(AbstractHttpClient.java:557) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.execute(AbstractHttpClient.java:509) 06-04 11:14:08.139: W/System.err(8338): at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.execute(AbstractHttpClient.java:487)
I'm really having some problems with Eclipse and Android SDK, I have been working on a project, and I opened it and I got an error staying about the project.properties, I used the android tools -> Fix project properties and I still got the project properties. So I removed the project from the workspace folder, I then moved it to my desktop and then imported to Eclipse, I now get this. Description Resource Path Location Type error: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:Theme.Holo.Light.DarkActionBar'. styles.xml /Ball-O/res/values-v14 line 8 Android AAPT Problem Description Resource Path Location Type error: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:Theme.Holo.Light'. styles.xml /Ball-O/res/values-v11 line 7 Android AAPT Problem Does anyone know how to fix this? Canvas Update I'm getting this error now Project has no project.properties file!
I am checking out the new features of Java SE7 and I am currently at this point: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/catch-multiple.html regarding the catch multiple feature, when I came across this statement: Note: If a catch block handles more than one exception type, then the catch parameter is implicitly final. In this example, the catch parameter ex is final and therefore you cannot assign any values to it within the catch block. I never noticed that the caught exception is not final in the classic case of handleing caught exceptions. I just wonder why is that a good thing in the first place? Would it not be ill-advised to essetially MODIFY a caught exception before I guess rethrowing it or maybe logging it's message? Should it not be up to the trowing mechanism to create the exception so it represents exactly what it should? I have never seen an exception being modified in the catch block can maybe someone point out it's benefits? Thanks!
By using EclipseLink JPA2.0 I have build an application which was working fine. Then I add some attribute in a table and regenerate that table entity. But when I call create method by facade(session bean) on that particular entity that throws exception that first new column does not exist. When I removed that column from entity then error went for second new column. But columns exist in table with same name. In-fact I have re-generated all entities via netbeans Code is working fine on one machine but throwing exception continuously on other machine. even with same code same environment.

I hate asking this because so many people ask it, but I've yet to see complete answer. I can no longer compile because of the proverbial java heap space out of memory error. my eclipse.ini had only two lines in it originally: -data @noDefault I've tried adding various things like: -data -vmargs -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m @noDefault or -data @noDefault -vmargs -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m or -data @noDefault -startup --launcher.XXMaxPermSize 1024m -vmargs -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m I've also tried much longer code additions and other permutations of the above code, and different memory adds like 512m, as per various suggestions on this site. what would be nice is a COMPLETE code listing for the eclipse.ini file for people who had next to nothing in it to start, like me and others with just 2 lines in this file, including instructions on which lines would have to be changed for one's own configuration, for windows (i'm running windows 7 premium). also using the command line with: eclipse -vmargs -Xms512m -Xmx512m or eclipse -vmargs -Xms512m -Xmx512m -XXMaxPermSize=512m has not worked. i'm willing to run the command line for every eclipse launch if I found a command line sequence that worked. it would be a shame if coders to spend the research and study time becoming an expert at eclipse.ini file manipulation just to fix the common out of heap space memory error.
This question is really, really stupid as I have no experience with Maven. I was interested in NanoHTTPD as an embedded web server in my project, but upon downloading the source and testing it out, I get the following error: Failed to execute goal on project nanohttpd-samples: Could not resolve dependencies for project fi.iki.elonen:nanohttpd-samples:jar:2.0.2: The following artifacts could not be resolved: fi.iki.elonen:nanohttpd:jar:2.0.2, fi.iki.elonen:nanohttpd-webserver:jar:2.0.2: Failure to find fi.iki.elonen:nanohttpd:jar:2.0.2 in http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1] I tried the -e flag and netbeans spat out a tonne more errors related to Maven, which none made sense. I also tried putting together one that did not involve Maven myself, which it didn't work. I Googled for an hour and absolutely no answers are avail. Results are <10 and none are related to nanohttpd. I know Maven is similar to Ant, but I have no idea how it works. Anyway, NanoHTTPD > https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd I am using netbeans, with JDK 7 downloaded today on this new linux box. Help is appreciated. Below is the error reproduced on Fedora Netbeans, Stock JDK7 + NB bundle. Full resolution : http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/2061/screenshot0608201310360.png Thank you!

I am attempting to query a MySQL database from a java program on EC2. My database is stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) RDS. When I test my java program from my local tomcat server, I successfully query the RDS database. However, when I query my RDS database from my EC2 instance, I fail to connect. In my attempts to solve this problem, I investigated my security settings. I've set up an RDS security group associated with my EC2 Security group that is associated with my instance. In my EC2 security group I've enabled all types of inbound traffic to all ports. Other answers to similar questions suggest that setting up the RDS security groups to accept connections from the EC2 instance is the resolution to this problem. However, I have seemingly done this, yet cannot connect from my EC2 instance (but can from my local machine). Am I overlooking something?
I have a grails application. I don’t have the War file. I only have the folders and the files. I am trying to install it and I am facing problems. The steps I am using are: I am creating a zip file that contains the application(files and folders) I am going to Elastic Beanstalk wizard and I am creating new environment using TomaCat 7. I am using all the default configurations. I upload the zip that contains the application when the wizard ask for that. Finally the wizard informs me that the application installed correctly, but when I am trying to View running version I am taking the error HTTP Status 404. //Edit // The error: Error Compilation error: startup failed: General error during semantic analysis: unable to locate the java compiler com.sun.tools.javac.Main, please change your classloader settings java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: unable to locate the java compiler com.sun.tools.javac.Main, please change your classloader settings at org.codehaus.groovy.tools.javac.JavacJavaCompiler.findJavac(JavacJavaCompiler.java:190)
I am using a brand new developing pc and need to test a personal application that runs on a local GlassFish server 3.1.2 and should connect with a local SQL database called 'funkOneDB' (my IDE is NetBeans 7.2.1). But I can't get the GlassFish server to connect with the database, and the problem seems to be related to the (place of the) SQL driver in the GlassFish Server's directories (more problem specifics in a few lines). I am fairly certain I correctly set up the related JDBC Resource and Connection Pool on the GlassFish Server (as I mimic a set-up already existing and working properly on another developing pc). The Resource specifics are: jndi name: jdbc/FunkResource pool name: FunkPool The (most important) Pool specifics are: pool name: FunkPool resource type: javax.sql.Datasource datasource classname: com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource additional properties correspond to the specifics in the XML GlassFish-resources of the application (username, password, url, etc.; no problems there) I first placed the necessary SQL driver in the GlassFish Server's directories, i.e. the file mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar at ..\GlassFish3\GlassFish\domains\domain1\lib\ext. Yet, when I perform a ping test from the JDBC Pool 'FunkPool' at the GlassFish server, I get the following error: Ping Connection Pool failed for FunkPool. WEB9031: WebappClassLoader unable to load resource [com.mysql.jdbc.SQLError], because it has not yet been started, or was already stopped Please check the server.log for more details. In the server.log I only find the following extra logging exception and failure info: (i) Exception while creating an unpooled [test] connection for pool [ FunkPool ], WEB9031: WebappClassLoader unable to load resource [com.mysql.jdbc.SQLError], because it has not yet been started, or was already stopped (ii) RestResponse.getResponse() gives FAILURE. endpoint = 'http://localhost:4848/management/domain/resources/ping-connection-pool.json'; attrs = '{id=FunkPool}' Note however, that when I ping the database funkOneDB from my IDE NetBeans via jdbc:mysql://localhost:33066/funkOneDB, it's succesful. As already mentioned, the credentials and other data I use for this IDE-based ping are the same data I use in the JDBC Connection Pool. I searched for the problem also on stackoverflow for some. And I did find some people talking about it, like Glassfisch MySQL ping ERROR (no answer by anybody), or Struggling to create MySQL Connection Pool on Glassfish (tried that solution, i.e. putting the SQL driver one level up in ..\GlassFish3\GlassFish\domains\domain1\lib\, but this creates other errors, even after restarting the Glassfish server), or GlassFish not loading connector (even tried this solution, no succes). Can somebody help me solve this problem? Many thanks in advance! With kind regards, Heinz
I am in a situation where I catch anInterruptedException but I put a breakpoint at the beginning of the Thread.interrupt() method and there is no hit. What else can cause InterruptedException to be thrown? Note that I encounter this problem only on Windows, the same code runs fine on Linux. As the interrupt method delegates to a native call interrupt0, I guess it comes from there. But how can I investigate further ? Thanks EDIT: I found my problem. It was also my misunderstanding of the interrupt mechanism. Thread.interrupt is called indeed. What bit me is that it is called long before I start the wait(). But as the thread has the interrupt flag activated, the first call to wait throws the exception immediately. In my case, it was log4j who set the interrupted flag when it tries to create a NonBlockingSocketAppender on an invalid address. Even weird is that it interrupts the thread it is currently running on...
I see lots of questions about how to make Intellij break on exceptions. I'm trying to do something different: I want to throw an exception at a breakpoint so that I can see what will happen if an exception were to occur at that code. I've figured out ways to force this. For example, if I have a variable called willBeUsed, I can hit a breakpoint and add a watch that says willBeUsed = null. This will trigger a NullPointerException eventually. But I'm in a situation where I want to throw an IOException to see what happens. There's no way to trick my code into doing that. When I add a watch that says throw new IOException() it gives me an error saying, "unexpected tokens". As a work around, I can modify the code to throw the exception and redeploy. But I'm wondering if there's a way to do this in the debugger without modifying source code.
I'm running in 64-bit Windows 7 and Server 2008 with a 64-bit JVM, and I get "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread" in a program with plenty of memory available. I have read on and on about garbage collection and heap generations and so forth, but nothing seems to explain this case. The closest I've come is one entry that gave a program that allocates idle threads (How to hit java.lang.OutOfMemoryError by spawning threads? under the Ajay George response) and at least recreates the problem we have in our production code. The problem is that we get the OOM with plenty of OS memory (RAM) available, very little allocated in the heap, and no response to the OOM exception when we run with -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError. When running the code above (the idle thread spawner) using a small heap setting (Xmx16M) and a large stack setting (Xss1G) the java process allocates about 8179 threads before failing and has a large commit size when viewed in task manager, but other than that it has claimed very few resources. I've turned on GC tracing and observed very little activity (usually two GCs) prior to the failure. I've boosted the PermGen to no avail. I boosted the initial heap size to the point where it isn't consumed prior to the failure (Xms1024M Xmx65536M) and it still gets OOM. I've looked at both of these using the YourKit profiler and it shows exactly what I suspected, which is the heap is not consumed and very few GCs have occurred. The problem I have in production however only has about 150-300 threads (it varies) when it fails and the stack size is defaulted, so probably 1M in windows. What I'm trying to find out is how to determine what is causing the problem so I can make appropriate changes to our code. Is there something special the JVM does when creating threads that has a very limited memory source? I know that with NIO and memory mapped files that the JVM doesn't track the background memory backings and high levels of churning in memory mappings will quickly run out of memory, but in that case the OS shows the use of the memory by the JVM. In our thread case the OS shows the JVM as having a small amount of memory in use.
after hours and hours of search to get it running I'm stuck now. So what happened? I tried to dive into the PlayN framework to code my first game on android. With a little struggle I generated my first project with maven (because apparently some versions aren't available in the maven repo) so I used the newest version of the playn-archetype: mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.googlecode.playn -DarchetypeArtifactId=playn-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.7.1 which generated my project neatly. Then I changed the Android SDK to 17 instead of the generated 11 and run the project. But instead of the background image which is in the assets project of PlayN I only get a black screen with a little box in the corner of my Phone which contains ERROR ERROR. Neither LogCat or any other Logging feature in IntelliJ-IDEA showed any exception or error so far. here is a picture of the screen Has anyone encountered and fixed this problem? Thank you for your help! Stuff I'm using: Android SDK 17 Java Development Kit 7 update 25 IntelliJ IDEA 12
I'm working on an application which uses a serial connection to a USB device (Shows up as a COM port). On the previous HW, a silabs chip was used and silabs drivers was installed on the PC. The new HW uses a internal USB block and now has a custom driver. When I use/used the old HW, I would get a exception in my reader thread in the read() call, when the USB device was disconnected, but with the new setup this is not the case. I have been looking at the drivers and where silabs depends on its own .sys files, the new driver uses usbser.sys. I have been reading alot about the different sections in a INF files, assuming that this was related to a driver problem but can not seem to find any thing which pops in my eyes. The application is written in Java and uses the jComport component. Sadly I'm not allowed to post any driver code, but hope you guys can help me anyway. Anyone which can pass on some information to help me ?

I'm trying to assemble a project using maven and the OpenImaj library, I been following the instructions on this page http://www.openimaj.org/tutorial/getting-started-with-openimaj-using-maven.html but some of the process seems to be different from the one outline in the tutorial, I have tried this on two different computers (mac and pc) and received the following errors/steps, any idea of where/what I am doing wrong will be helpful. after running the mvn -DarchetypeCatalog=http://maven.openimaj.org/archetype-catalog.xml archetype:generate line I am prompt to "Choose a number or apply filter" where the default is 284. Once I select 284 (should I be selecting anything else?), I'm being prompt to select "maven-archetype-quickstart version" where I choose the latest 6:1.1, following by the groupId, artifactId, version, package, and Y confirmation, this result with 'Build Success' and create the directory as well as the pom.xml file on my computer. When I navigate to the project folder "cd projectName" and run the mvn assembly:assembly command, I first see that a few of the packages are being collected, then I see a "Build Failure" notification -"Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:2.2-beta-5.... No assembly descriptors found. any idea what I am doing wrong and how I can get the OpenImaj lib integrated into a project, should I be downloading the SVN version and attempt to set the projects from local libraries. Many thanks in advance!
I know java can't give me the name of the null field at run time, but in many cases having an NullPointerException message that contains the null Object run time class name, could probably make it much easier to trace the Exception cause. Or am I missing something and this too is impossible? P.S. Even if there's no such standard way, can you think of a trick to get it done? EDIT: For clarification - I know I can (most of the times) trace the source easily from the code line, but: in some cases it will require deeper digging into the called methods (if the try block is not deep enough - which is a poor way to code but sometimes it's a given fact). Say some new SO guy asks about such Exception, then having the message could help us solve his problem much faster (which is true in any case of debugging from logs).
I have done more than an hour of searching while trying to run JUnit on my project. I can see that there is a class missing - LogEntryFormatter.

i have a form where i have 5 TextFields that are required and 25 that are optional. I set the required TextFields setRequired(true) and get the Feedback messages i want when this fields are empty. But how do i achieve such an effect that i get warning messages in my feedback panel when the 25 fields are empty but the form still does submit correctly? I want to inform the user that these fields are optional, but it would be nice if he would fill them. I know i can in onSubmit() add warnings through the warn() procedure. But in on submit i can only check the model for this values, i dont have the component that is empty. But i would like to have the functionality of Validators so that i can say to the user that Field 'optionalTextField1' has no value but it would be nice if you fill it, i can user properties for the messages and so on. Any ideas how to do this?
This is my first question here, and, for some reason, when trying to upload a screenshot of my problem, I got an error message which read Failed to upload image; couldn't reach imgur Anyway, I have uploaded it onto Google Photos, so I will send the link after explaining a little what it is. I am new to developping Apps in Java, specially when it is about connecting to JDBC. So, as the target database is a SyBase one, I downloaded JTDS JDBC Driver from its official website on sourceforge Afterwards I did what was suggested here so as to set up the class path. Include jtds1.3.1 into the library and my project, so it was supposed to work, and... voilà! A fantastic ClassNotFoundException when executing the Class.forName() method to load the driver. Here is the screenshot, being lines 35 and 37 the ones of interest. I would be so grateful should someone help me a little, however stupid may be the error I may be doing to have this problem - which sure it is. Thanks.
When I try to use a java.sql.Timestamp value to insert into a DATETIME column in MySQL 5.6, I always get this error: com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlDataTruncation: Data truncation: Incorrect datetime value: '' for column 'invoice_date' at row 1 The original developer of this project had custom JARs that created the Prepared statements, such that java.util.Date is converted into Timestamp to be inserted into DATETIME and vice versa, as well as handled database connections. Note that this is my assumption since there is no documentation about it. Trying to use a timestamp to insert into DATETIME myself via PreparedStatement had the same results, using something like: ps.setTimestamp(3, new Timestamp(date.getTime())); I had to create my own connection so that I can use java.sql.Date to solve this problem. However it zeroes the time value as a result. I used ps.setDate(3, new java.sql.Date(date.getTime())); And I get something like 2013-06-27 00:00:00 in the table, since as we know java.sql.Date doesn't store the time. Surprisingly, on a server that uses MySQL 5.0, this works normally. I'm assuming the millisecond value in Timestamp is causing the problem casting into DATETIME? Since the original works in older versions. Is there any way to resolve this without having to reinstall everything with 5.0?
I have a Java Web Start application that installs shortcuts on the desktop to allow launching later. The JNLP is hosted in a normal Apache Web Server which is accessible without requiring authentication. This works correctly. However, I have a problem in the following scenario The user launches for the first time and creates the shortcuts successfully User disconnects, and then logs in to a Wireless Network that requires authentication with a log-in site (typical, for example, in hotels: when you type www.google.com it instead redirects you to a login site) Without login in first, the user attempts to connect by double clicking on the shortcut What happens in this case, is that the JWS machinery downloads the jnlp url, but instead of getting the jnlp it gets the login site. It is then unable to launch the JNLP application as this web site can not be parsed, and furthermore, the link is now forever broken, as it points to an invalid locally cached JNLP. The only solution seems to be to manually remove the links and connect online to download the JNLP again IS there a way that I can avoid this issue?
Are there are any accepted best practices/strategies in tracking down the root cause of NullPointerExceptions in Java, in particular when it comes to threading? The background: I have a threaded app that uses Apache's HttpClient 4.2, and from time to time we see what seems to be a NullPointer occuring when we call the HttpClient's execute method. ("What seems to be", as the returned value is just null.) I know all threads share the same HttpClient with the same PoolingClientConnectionManager (thanks to a System.out.println(httpClient), printing out the references), but it seems like we still get thread-related errors in the library (probably due to something we did wrong). And while I would love to find a solution to that particular problem, I'm much more interested in general approaches to finding the root cause of NullPointerExceptions - as I said, especially for threading, and even more if the exception gets thrown deep inside a library.
I have implemented a HTTP client using Netty4.0.0.CR3. I am managing a pool of client connection toward server, Based on certain event an event handler thread pick one connection from the pool, send the HTTP request to server, wait for response (FullHttpResponse) and then release connection back to pool. Now problem which I am facing is that under heavy load I am getting these warnings in my log, ` 15:56:59.828 nioEventLoopGroup-37-1 WARN i.n.c.nio.NioEventLoop - Slf4JLogger.warn() : Unexpected exception in the selector loop. java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: event executor terminated at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.reject(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:711) ~[netty-all-4.0.0.CR3.jar:na] at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.addTask(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:306) ~[netty-all-4.0.0.CR3.jar:na] at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.execute(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:696) ~[netty-all-4.0.0.CR3.jar:na] at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AbstractUnsafe.invokeLater(AbstractChannel.java:968) ~[netty-all-4.0.0.CR3.jar:na] at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AbstractUnsafe.close(AbstractChannel.java:750) ~[netty-all-4.0.0.CR3.jar:na] at io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.closeAll(NioEventLoop.java:521) ~[netty-all-4.0.0.CR3.jar:na] at io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.run(NioEventLoop.java:329) ~[netty-all-4.0.0.CR3.jar:na] at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor$2.run(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:114) [netty-all-4.0.0.CR3.jar:na] at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:680) [na:1.6.0_45] ` Now, what i want to ask is, will these warnings will create any problem, if yes any pointers on how to solve this or I can ignore them.

I have a JSP file in which I have used many CSS classes. I have defined those CSS in .css file. If I don't include .css file in the path then JSP will not work as per expectation. In bigger project how can I trace absence of .css file? Do we have any browser where I can see/trace CSS errors? No features of Firebug give any error if we miss to include .css file in the project. I am using Firebug and could not find .css error file by using firebug. We should have prior knowledge that we must have missed to include .css file that is why JSP file is not being render properly. But what if somebody else who doesn't have knowledge which .css(or any other html, jsp, javascript) file to be included then such features like FIREBUG is useful. But in case of .css firebug doesn't give error trace
I am trying to debug my first app. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 with Android Jelly Bean (I'm a Windows user) and I have installed the latest version of Kies and have installed all required drivers for my device. Following the steps to debug in the Android Getting Started tutorial, I have not been able to successfully debug my app on my phone or in an emulator. Actually I don't really care fo the emulator at this point since this app is just a hello world app. I need to see it on my device but I can't and I don't know what I'm doing wrong, if anythin. When I hit the debug button in Android Studio, and select my Device as the device to debug on from the popup dialog, Android Studio then displays the following error: Installing myapplication DEVICE SHELL COMMAND: pm install -r "/data/local/tmp/myapplication" pkg: /data/local/tmp/myapplication Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK] I have searched this error but all the solutionts I have seen are telling me to do things I've already done! How can I debug an app on Samsung GS3 using Android Studio?
I rented a little tomcat server to provide http-get service for an android app via jsp on dailyRazor. The maximum java heap is "Max memory: 92.81 MB". Default tomcat setting for maxThreads was 25. As the number of users using my service growed, i was getting lots of refused connections / timeouts for the server at prime time (which i think was because the thread pool is too small). Thats why I increased the maxThreads to 250. In this night, the server crashed showing me multiple java.lang.OutOfMemoryError s. 250 seems to be a bit to heavy for the little heap :p I temporary reduced maxThreads to 50 which seems to be fine as i dont get any more errors. As i dont know much about tomcat, i want to ask for a good way to find the right number for maxThreads. I thought about looking at the maximum memory usage of one thread. Then maxThreads = (maxMemory / memoryOfOneThread). Is there a better solution? thanks danijoo
This should be easy, but it's been costing me tons of time. I basically can't get a RESTful web service running under eclipse. I'm sure I'm missing something stupid, but resources seem to be a bit scattered and nothing covers the recent 4.0/EE 7 release. I have a clean install of Eclipse Kepler (4.3). I try and set up a basic RESTful app using the following steps. I have Java EE 7 installed I open eclipse, point it to a fresh workspace and create a new 'Dynamic Web Application'. Project name doesn't particularly matter, a new Target Runtime is created by downloading the Glassfish extension (New Runtime->Download additional server adapters->Glassfish). This requires restarting eclipse - so just repeat the previous, but select a Glassfish 4.0 runtime after clicking 'New Runtime'. Web Module is 3.1, everything else is default. I click 'Finish' to create my new project. I then right click and open project properties, then 'Project Facets'. I check of JAX-RS (REST Web Services). Then click 'Further Configuration required...". I then select 'Disable Library Configuration' from the drop down. The fields receive the following values: JAX-RS servlet name: JAX-RS Servlet JAX-RS servlet class name: org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer URL mapping patterns: /jaxrs/* I then click OK to close all the windows. Now adding a New->'RESTful Web Service from Pattern' creates a new class, that doesn't seem to ever get picked up by glassfish on deployment. My understanding is that it should auto scan and pick up things with an @path. It doesn't seem to. If I finagle things enough I can seem to access the application.wadl - but doesn't show my resource. If I go back into properties and take a look at my JAX-RS project facet, I'm presented with an error box saying some of my values are invalid. In the workspace log I'm greeted with the following exception: !ENTRY org.eclipse.jst.jee 4 0 2013-07-02 21:54:27.780 !MESSAGE org.eclipse.jst.javaee.web.internal.impl.WebAppImpl cannot be cast to org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.webapplication.WebApp !STACK 0 java.lang.ClassCastException: org.eclipse.jst.javaee.web.internal.impl.WebAppImpl cannot be cast to org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.webapplication.WebApp at org.eclipse.jst.ws.jaxrs.core.internal.project.facet.UpdateWebXMLForJ2EE.run(UpdateWebXMLForJ2EE.java:32) at org.eclipse.jst.jee.model.internal.JEE5ModelProvider.modify(JEE5ModelProvider.java:255) at org.eclipse.jst.jee.model.internal.Web25MergedModelProvider.modify(Web25MergedModelProvider.java:92) at org.eclipse.jst.ws.jaxrs.core.internal.project.facet.JAXRSFacetInstallDelegate.createServletAndModifyWebXML(JAXRSFacetInstallDelegate.java:275) at org.eclipse.jst.ws.jaxrs.core.internal.project.facet.JAXRSFacetInstallDelegate.execute(JAXRSFacetInstallDelegate.java:156) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.internal.FacetedProject.callDelegate(FacetedProject.java:1477) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.internal.FacetedProject.modifyInternal(FacetedProject.java:441) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.internal.FacetedProject.mergeChangesInternal(FacetedProject.java:1181) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.internal.FacetedProject.access$2(FacetedProject.java:1117) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.internal.FacetedProject$5.run(FacetedProject.java:1099) at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.run(Workspace.java:2345) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.internal.FacetedProject.mergeChanges(FacetedProject.java:1109) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.internal.FacetedProjectWorkingCopy.commitChanges(FacetedProjectWorkingCopy.java:2020) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.ui.internal.FacetsPropertyPage$4.run(FacetsPropertyPage.java:232) at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.run(Workspace.java:2345) at org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.ui.internal.FacetsPropertyPage$5.run(FacetsPropertyPage.java:246) at org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run(ModalContext.java:121) Any insight would be so greatly appreciated.
I am using EJB3.0. I have an application running on websphere app server v7 who is executing a remote ejb 3.0 running in a different application on the same app server. I use @EJB annotation to inject remote interface in my code. It runs fine, so I am sure all configuration and code is ok. When the other application (containing the ejb) is restarted (it may be deployed because of a fix elsewhere in the code) my application and its client does not run anymore, it seems to lose the reference of the ejb stub. I can fix the problem simply restarting my application, but it is not a good practice in our production environment. I would like to re-inject or renew the ejb if needed. Is it possible? Another way should be creating ejb stubs and adding them to my application (not a good thing anyway, I would avoid it). I also tried to switch to the old 'lookup' way through InitialContext but only get a ClassCastException on stubs... again, it seems to need concrete stubs again... Is there a simple solution to this 'classic' scenario? Thank you MMad
I'm creating screenshots in my testcases with selenium webdriver, and while these indeed show what is visible in my web application, it doesn't show popups created by the browser. I have found that in IE in some cases, my app triggers a JS debug popup in IE. This is of course an error and breaks the rest of my test, but the screenshot does not show the error. I presume this is because it's an IE native popup, rather than one trigger by my application. Is it possible to get this included in the screenshots? I was thinking of maybe creating the screenshot with Robot#createScreenCapture() but obviously that wouldn't show anything useful if the browser is minimized. So, a few possible solutions: - can you detect if an error message pops up in a browser - is it possible to maximise/focus the browser while running? - can you take screenshots from selenium with the popups showing?

I have a class foo that my application generates, then compiles using the command line, and then loads using a custom classloader. The reason this had to be done is that the application "generates java code" for the class foo that it then incorporates into its own program using a classloader. As an application this works fine. Now I am trying to port this to tomcat. The custom classloader loads this file from outside of tomcat (this may be an issue but I have not seen an error message about that, the application generates, writes the file for foo.java, calls javac to build it, and the classloader certainly finds foo.class since it can't find fooparent. fooparent is already in the application, I see it in the jar file that is loaded by tomcat. Again, as an application this works. Now, foo extends fooparent. I read: ClassLoaders are hierarchical, meaning your dynamically loaded class has access to all of its parent's classes, but the parent doesn't have any direct access to its classes. But I am not told what is the solution? It seems that in tomcat, it loads the foo class and then gives a NoClassDefFoundError for the "fooparent". It seems like the parent of foo was loaded before by a parent classloader but my custom classloader is not visible to what other classloaders have already loaded to be seen and in a sense integrated. I am trying to find out if I am trying to do the impossible and if I should abandon this.
I have an application which is scheduler running different threads. The application may load new Runnable classes and run them. Currently the application is in production, that is it's running on remote server. My team consists of 3 people developing Runnable classes. When the class is ready, it's uploaded to server and loaded to scheduler. I would like to give my team the ability to debug specific threads. That is: person A may debug threads of Runnable A, B-B, and so on. Giving them the full access to the remote JVM is not a solution, because the developers are not allowed to see the system core, and each others solutions. So my question is: how to allow multiple remote debugging with thread specific connections? Preferable IDE: Eclipse EDIT: It's possible to connect remotely to specific thread with jdb http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/jdb.html Here is an example: http://www.itec.uni-klu.ac.at/~harald/CSE/Content/debugging.html 1) Find your thread with jdb threads 2) Put breakpoint and enter the wanted thread Still the security issue stays. One solution was to compile protected code without debug symbols, but it will only protect the core, allow seeing each other's threads. So, next step - digging Security Manager. Maybe there's privilege layer suitable for my situation.
I am wondering if anyone could expand on any of these attempts or has any other ideas for catching JS errors using WebDriver that will work in Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari. Here is what's been tried so far: Attempt – Problem: JSErrorCollector.jar - Works fine, but is a Firefox only solution. Inject JS into page source – I injected window.onerror code into the page’s source code using WebDriver, but any initial errors are missed because the injection is too late. BrowserMob – I can intercept the HTTP response and planned to inject the window.onerror code into response body, but the author has not implemented the getBody() method yet, so only headers can be modified, that I am aware of. The body is always null for all responses. (I was on a webpage where the author talked about implementing getBody() but it hasn’t happened yet and I cannot find it again) Fiddler – JS will inject correctly, but Fiddler is Windows only so Safari won’t work. Parent/Child windows – I use javascript to open and store a reference to the test page’s window. The window.onerror code is contained in the parent window so it will not miss startup errors in the child window. I cannot get this to work in anything but Firefox and Chome somewhat. I already asked a question about it here. Selenium RC – I haven’t tried it because all my tests use WebDriver, but I know it has some kind of method like captureNetworkTraffic(), but I don’t think it can be used in WebDriver. IE error popup – I was going to use the parent/child solution for Firefox/Chrome and then look for the IE error popup. This popup displays when the setting is checked to display it. The popup is a native Window window (I think) so I cannot use selenium to access it. Read browser console – I could not find a way to do this in all browsers. In Chrome I found a way to save the console log to a file and then read the file. That is as far as I got. I would like a solution similar to BrowserMob since it seems like it would be a cross browser solution. Are there any other proxies that can be put in the test and intercept the response? It would have been excellent if the getBody() method was implemented. I also like the parent/child solution because it also seems like a simple, cross browser solution, but it is not working for IE (parent/child question again). Thanks for any help.
I have seen this question asked a lot, but I still can't figure out a solution to it. Well a solution that works for me. I have a project that is using Apache POI, and I made sure to include all the external JARs. The project compiles and runs fine in eclipse but when I run the jar with "java -jar Test.jar" I get this error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/poi/ss/usermodel/Sheet I'm not sure if this is useful information, but I created a lib folder for my project and put the poi library in there. This means that the dependcies are in the JAR file when I create it, I figured I should mention this because I saw a few solutions about just having your external jars right next to your executable jar. I also tried setting my classpath to the directory of the project. What do I seem to be doing wrong?

I'm having problems to run eclipse in my job - at my home desktop I got everything as a 64 bit version. What I did was copy the folders to my job desktop and it doesn't. I checked the architecture here and it's 64 bits too. The failure come from both sides: If I set my virtual machine as: C:\jre7\bin\javaw.exe I receive the error from code 13. If I set the virtual machine as C:\jre7\bin\client\jvm.dll I receive the error from "Can't load shared library" my source researches were : Failed to load the JNI shared Library (JDK) Eclipse reported "Failed to load JNI shared library" Cannot run Eclipse; JVM terminated. Exit code=13 Can't start Eclipse - Java was started but returned exit code=13 Eclipse crashes at startup; Exit code=13 Resuming: Home desktop - Windows 64, JRE 64, Eclipse Juno 64 Job desktop - Windows 64, JRE 64, Eclipse Juno 64 Anyone got any idea of what I could do? Cos with my research everything I tryed was in vain.
We use slf4j and logback for logging in our java ee web application. Recently in order to move these libraries to a common location in the glassfish app server (to glassfish\lib directory specifically) we made a couple of configuration changes. We made changes in the web.xml file to add JNDI entries and renamed the logback.xml to logback-<context-name>.xml as specified in here. The logback-<context-name>.xml is placed in WEB-INF\classes directory. After this change, logging for hibernate and http-client libraries is defaulting to debug mode and hence there is lot of logging being done. The root logger has INFO log level and there are no specific loggers defined for hibernate & http-client libraries. If I revert this change i.e. remove the jndi entry in web.xml and rename the configuration file to logback.xml, only INFO logs are logged as expected. Any suggestions on what could be the issue? Thanks. Update On troubleshooting further I released that hibernate and apache client libraries use the default logger context created during the initialization time. This logger context has the root log level set to DEBUG. We use JNDI as the context selector. It is strange that the context name is not found at runtime when the ConnectionManager class (hibernate class - org.hibernate.jdbc.ConnectionManager) tries to instantiate a logger. Logger instance creation calls ContextJNDISelector.getLoggerContext() method. This method does a JNDI lookup but does not find the entry. I troubleshooted further by spawning a thread in a servlet context listener to print the JNDI entry (java:comp/env/logback/context-name) every 3 seconds. The logs from the thread indicate that the JNDI entries are always present. Any ideas why is contextName is not found in JNDI when queried by ContextJNDISelector?
I have a problem with a Java application. Sometimes, when I run my application on an Ubuntu Server, a ClassNotFoundException occurs. I said sometimes because the error appears randomly: sometimes after a long time (and restarting the app fixes the bug), sometimes at the first time the concerned class is used (and rebuild the app fixes the bug). Note that it's not always the same class that causes the error. Also note that I don't use Class.forName() or Classloader.loadClass() or ClassLoader.findSystemClass(). I run my application via the command : java -jar server.jar All the classes are in the Jar file (I unzipped it to check) and the Manifest is correct.

We have used HashMaps in someplaces for storing some data.From logs we can I identify that its reproducing at the same place. I wanted to ask if Garbage Collector spends more time in clearing up the hashmaps? Upon looking at the code( i cant share here ), I have found that that there is a Hashmap created like Hashmap topo = new HashMap(); but this hashmap is never used. Is this a kind of memory leak in my application ? If this Hashmap is created inside a method which is doing some processing and it is not used elsewhere also this method is accessed my multiple threads say 20 .Then in such a case would it impact,creating Hashmap as above, Garbage collector to spend more time in recovering heap and throw OOME. Please let me know if you need some more details.
I'm currently developing a Java Agent in order to facilitate the dynamic instrumentation of new and legacy Java Applications. It occurred to me that, as far as IDE debugging is concerned, Java Agents could be perhaps considered a special case as they are required to be injected into a target JVM process in order to be ran. Which thus naturally gives rise to the question of how one would go about debugging, testing and profiling an Agent-type application. A cursory search for existing solutions turned up a few command line based options (i.e YourKit, JIP, etc) however many of them are ALSO Java Agents under the hood. Which if utilized would lead to, at least in my view, the rather odd scenario of an Agent debugging/profiling another Agent. I am aware that Agents can be stacked in a hierarchical arrangement, however i'm unsure if Agent Applications can be debugged by stacking Agents in this manor.
i had started using datastax java driver from yesterday on latest version of cassandra 1.2.6...i cross checked start_native_transport: true is set in yaml...also my cassandra is configured with rpc_address and listen_adress as computer host name....and with same name i am connected in Client....but it shows this message and after that hangs at .build(); ... i had also cross checked i had taken all jars i have are as per http://www.datastax.com/documentation/developer/java-driver/1.0/java-driver/reference/settingUpJavaProgEnv_r.html and i am using JDK 1.6... Here is message i got : Jul 17, 2013 11:20:37 AM com.datastax.driver.core.Connection$Dispatcher messageReceived SEVERE: [mlhwlt08/192.168.2.111-1] No handler set for stream 0 (this is a bug, either of this driver or of Cassandra, you should report it).

PROBLEM SOLVED please read below : My problem solved..now i am able to create table and insert values in it with java client... Enabling TRACE mode was little problematic for me for that i removed all slf4j jars from classpath and downloaded latest ones, with that was able to see debug logs... Actual problem solved by removing this jar from my class path : google-collect-1.0-rc1.jar AND adding these two jars jackson-core-asl-1.9.2.jar, jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.2.jar Root cause was : com/google/common/collect/ImmutableSet this existed in two jars google-collect-1.0-rc1.jar AND guava-14.0.1.jar...so removing first jar solved it.... I hope this will help someone who will use datatstax java driver without maven.. Thanks for all help...

I am trying to deploy a WAR file on weblogic server. This is a simple java application. I am new to this and experimenting. JRE: 1.5.0_41, OS: redhat 5.8, Weblogic: WebLogic Server 10.0 MP2 The contents just include a jsp file and a java file (jsp inside jsp folder and java class inside WEB-INF\classes folder and correct package structure). I am using this java util file inside the jsp for some common utility methods. However, when I deploy the WAR, it gives me NoClassDefinitionFoundError for this java utility class. I have searched the threads and found that this exception points to some other inherent issue in the deployment. It also mentioned class path conflicts etc. I can understand this issue when it comes to using a class from an external JAR file, but could not understand how it fails to locate a file in the same context as that of the jsp. How come the import statements in the jsp worked and the jsp got compiled and rendered and failed only when the part of accessing this object came into picture? (runtime problem maybe?) Please educate me on this. My debugging efforts are still on. Thanks a lot, folks!! [P.S.: Could it be because i compiled and built my source using eclipse setting 1.7 compliance and used it on a lesser JRE?]
I am working in spring3 project. When I run my code sometimes i am getting this Jdbc Connection Exception for some particular functionality but other functionalities working very fine. And also this Exception is not occurring repetitively but sometimes, So I can't get where the mistake will be.

I have my own app. I'd like to use a treeview control in it (which I would prefer not to have to write on my own) and came across this one: http://code.google.com/p/tree-view-list-android I've downloaded all resources and put them into a separate project which is now in my workspace. When I remove the isLibrary flag temporarily I can also execute the test activity from it. So far so good. Now I want to use the control in my own program. I followed http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject. But instantly after clicking apply everywhere I am using R.* in my program I get an error saying "R cannot be resolved to a variable". It appears it can't find any layouts, strings, etc. from my own project. I try to add the import statement "import namespace.appname.R;". But instantly after saving the file the line is removed again. Does anybody have an idea? There are a lot of posts around the R-error, but I haven't found one that involves library usage.
I'm getting this message in the following scenario: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: agents.MemoryAgent I've bundled, by hand following this link, a java agent class into a jar. For the run/debug configuration I've copied a working entry and added VM arguments. I've tried both of these (the constant arguments are carried over from the copied config) -javaagent:agent.jar -Xms256m -Xmx1024m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true And -javaagent:agent.jar -cp . -Xms256m -Xmx1024m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true NOTE: pseudonym class used here, real class exists I've tried putting the agent.jar file into the 'Working Directory' specified above, as well as the 'Project compiler output' directory specified in the project structure/setting dialog. The entire contents of my manifest.txt file: Premain-Class: agents.MemoryAgent Which yields in the META-INF\MANIFEST.MF file when extracted: Manifest-Version: 1.0 Created-By: 1.6.0 (Sun Microsystems Inc.) Premain-Class: agents.MemoryAgent I have verified that the class' path matches that used in the jar and class files. I'm using: java version "1.7.0_25" Intellij12.1 Why can't it find the class? In the screenshot a field is titled 'Use classpath of module', but I could not find anywhere that this is defined. Is that relevant?
I realize there were a bunch of these questions a few years ago. But those problems were fixed an update to Java 6. But I'm on Java 7. I'm on a Mac OS X, Java 7, everything is up to date. Things I've tried: Project Clean In the debug config, I tried telling it to not run in the background. In the debug config, tried both running all tests in class and just running a specific test Double checked jar files and project config The unit tests DO run, they just don't pause for debugging. Update: If I set a breakpoint in the grandparent class SolrTestCasJ4, which is in a second project open in the workspace, AND change the debug config from running a method to run all, it stops near the top of one of my test methods. But it only for an initial breakpoint in the grandparent class. I guess that's an OK workaround for now, but a bit weird and not really an explanation.
We are trying a simple use case of reading/writing to a mysql database using JPA from Camel routes inside Karaf.

We have an older web-based application (Java with Spring 2.5.4 framework) running on a GlassFish 3.1 (build 43) server. This application was recently (a few weeks ago) re-directed to use an Oracle 11g (11.2.0.3.0) database and ojdbc6.jar/orai18n.jar (up from Oracle 10g 10.2.0.3.0 and ojdbc14.jar) -- using a JDBC Thin connection. The application is using org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource version 1.2.2 for connections and the database requests are handled either through Spring jdbcTemplate (via the JdbcDaoSupport abstract class) or Spring's PlatformTransactionManager. This morning we noticed that application users were able to enter information, modify it and later to retrieve and print that data through the application, but that there were no committed updates for the last 24 hours. This application currently has only a few users each day and they are apparently sharing the same connection which has been kept open by the connection pool during the last day and so their uncommitted updates were visible through the application, but not through other connections to the database. When the connection was closed, the uncommitted updates were lost. Examining the server logs showed no errors from the time of the last committed changes to the database through the times of printed reports the next morning. In addition, even if some of the changes had been (somehow) made with the JDBC connection being set to Auto-Commit false, there were specific commits made for some of those updates that were part of a transaction which, as part of a try/catch block should have either executed one of the "transactionManager.commit(transactionStatus);" or "transactionManager.rollback(transactionStatus);" calls that must have been processed without error. It looks as though the commit was returning successfully, but no commit actually occurred. Restarting the GlassFish domain and the application restored the normal operation with the various updates being committed as they are entered. My question is has anyone seen or heard about anything like this occurring and, if so, what could have caused it? Thank you for any ideas here -- we are at a loss. Some new information: Examination of our Oracle 11g Server showed that near the time that we believe that the commits appeared to stop, there were four operations blocked on some other operation that we were not able to fully resolve, but was probably an update. Examination of the Glassfish Server logs showed that the appearance of the worker threads changed following this estimated start time and fewer threads were appearing in the log until only one thread continued to be used for several hours. The problem occurred again about one week later and was caught after about 1/2 hour. At this time, there were two worker threads in operation.

I am running a jsvc application which is working absolutely fine but now I need to enable one port on my application so that I can do remote debugging. I am performing above task using java. Is there any way to achieve above task ? I have checked all JSVC option http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-daemon/jsvc.html but didn't find anything. Here is the code of adding jsvc parameter : private List getJSVCArgs(){ List jsvcArgs = new ArrayList(); jsvcArgs.add(jsvcDir+"/jsvc"); jsvcArgs.add("-pidfile"); jsvcArgs.add("pidfile.pid"); jsvcArgs.add("-outfile"); jsvcArgs.add("outfile.txt"); jsvcArgs.add("-errfile"); jsvcArgs.add("errfile.txt"); jsvcArgs.add("-wait"); jsvcArgs.add(String.valueOf(jvmProperties.get("-wait"))); jsvcArgs.add("-user"); jsvcArgs.add(System.getProperty("user.name")); jsvcArgs.add("-home"); jsvcArgs.add(System.getProperty("java.home")); return jsvcArgs; } Now I need to pass this "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8001,server=y,suspend=n" to JSVC. Anyone has any idea how to achieve it ?
I bought a site license for the GeoIP ISP database from Maxmind, and decided to implement it within my Google App Engine project. I tested my own External IP with a regular Java project which used the same API/JAR and was able to resolve it to Comcast. Implementing it within Google App Engine has been a pain. Using the same exact call (my own external IP), I received various IOExceptions, specifically EOFExceptions whenever using the standard LookupService (read from file) and OutOfBoundsArrayExceptions whenever using the memory-based LookupService. Some specific information: The database file size should NOT be an issue. It is around ~3mb. You can find the API open sourced here : https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-java I will eventually figure out this issue but it seems to be fairly low-level so it may take some time. I was wondering if anyone else had any issues. UPDATE- I've just confirmed the .dat file's MD5 changes whenever checked using Commons Codec 1.8 DigestUtils.md5Hex. It is different from the working files' MD5.
I have problem running MT4J examples. I try running he advance MTShell and I get the following errors.

Ok, I did my homework and searched around, but no one seem to be having quite the same problem, but tried solutions to similar problems to no avail. The peculiarity of my issue is that the project was working just fine last Thursday (last day I messed with it), but when I opened it this Tuesday, it just wouldn't build, giving me the mentioned error. And no, neither I nor anyone else as much as touched the project nor Eclipse. Another thing I've noticed is that, even though the project is properly converted to C/C++, it somehow at the same time is not, as at the project/properties/Paths and Symbols section Includes/Symbols tabs are missing; similarly, under Tool Chain Editor it simply doesn't show the dropdown option "No ToolChain" anymore (it did before as it was supposed to). Doesn't seem to be an issue with Eclipse as a whole since I was able to properly convert a different Java project to C/C++ without any issues, but I'm at a loss on what to do now or how to find the real problem. Anyone happens to know how to "unconvert" a project so I can start the whole thing from scratch without having to manually start a new project? EDIT: Fixed the project, for the record, it was some insane error that came out of literally nowhere, which caused the Properties to lose reference and add a bunch of filters that disabled both Classes and com.example.myproject.
Currently i having an Assignment of AI(Artificial Intelligence) to develop an Expert System. We are using SWI-PROLOG as our practical class learning software, and now i am trying to apply e2glite to my Assignment. I found that e2glite is able to download from www.expertise2go.com, and this website also providing the instruction and example. According to their instruction, computer must have Java(already installed). So now i am trying to preview the sample that i had downloaded from the website, i am able to view the interface, once i click the "START The Consultation" is giving me "ERROR 800: MUST QUIT". In debug mode, it show me "Found on line 0 (below) before character 1 null" According to the www.expertise2go.com, the meaning of error 800 is "Missing or Empty knowledge base". But i am follow exactly as the instruction to do it. I don't know where am i doing wrong. P/S: i can view sample from the website, but no from my computer
I've been trying to find a work around with this issue of RemoteDeathError. In the browser when I open my gwt application, after a while it shows that GWT DMP Plugin has crashed And looking the the devmode console, I can see this error: 00:02:49.491 [ERROR] Uncaught exception escaped com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannel$RemoteDeathError: Remote connection lost at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.reactToMessagesWhileWaitingForReturn(BrowserChannelServer.java:354) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.invokeJavascript(BrowserChannelServer.java:218) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpaceOOPHM.doInvoke(ModuleSpaceOOPHM.java:136) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpace.invokeNative(ModuleSpace.java:561) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpace.invokeNativeObject(ModuleSpace.java:269) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.JavaScriptHost.invokeNativeObject(JavaScriptHost.java:91) at com.google.gwt.core.client.impl.Impl.apply(Impl.java) at com.google.gwt.core.client.impl.Impl.entry0(Impl.java:213) at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor97.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:601) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.MethodAdaptor.invoke(MethodAdaptor.java:103) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.MethodDispatch.invoke(MethodDispatch.java:71) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.OophmSessionHandler.invoke(OophmSessionHandler.java:172) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.reactToMessages(BrowserChannelServer.java:292) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.processConnection(BrowserChannelServer.java:546) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.run(BrowserChannelServer.java:363) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722) Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset by peer: socket write error at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0(Native Method) at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite(SocketOutputStream.java:109) at java.net.SocketOutputStream.write(SocketOutputStream.java:153) at java.io.BufferedOutputStream.flushBuffer(BufferedOutputStream.java:82) at java.io.BufferedOutputStream.flush(BufferedOutputStream.java:140) at java.io.DataOutputStream.flush(DataOutputStream.java:123) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannel$ReturnMessage.send(BrowserChannel.java:1310) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannel$ReturnMessage.send(BrowserChannel.java:1315) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.reactToMessagesWhileWaitingForReturn(BrowserChannelServer.java:340) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.invokeJavascript(BrowserChannelServer.java:218) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpaceOOPHM.doInvoke(ModuleSpaceOOPHM.java:136) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpace.invokeNative(ModuleSpace.java:561) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.ModuleSpace.invokeNativeObject(ModuleSpace.java:269) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.JavaScriptHost.invokeNativeObject(JavaScriptHost.java:91) at com.google.gwt.core.client.impl.Impl.apply(Impl.java) at com.google.gwt.core.client.impl.Impl.entry0(Impl.java:213) at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor97.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:601) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.MethodAdaptor.invoke(MethodAdaptor.java:103) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.MethodDispatch.invoke(MethodDispatch.java:71) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.OophmSessionHandler.invoke(OophmSessionHandler.java:172) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.reactToMessages(BrowserChannelServer.java:292) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.processConnection(BrowserChannelServer.java:546) at com.google.gwt.dev.shell.BrowserChannelServer.run(BrowserChannelServer.java:363) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722) What the possible causes of this error and how can I fix it?
I have code that modifies an XML Document by adding an Attribute to an existing Element. Prior to the modification I run the Document through validation using Schema and Validator and it passes. However, after I add the Attribute (which is valid per the schema) if I pass the Document instance to the Validator it fails. If as an intermediary step I take the Document instance, convert it to a String and re-parse to a Document, this new Document passes validation. I assume I should not have to do this. I tried using normalizeDocument and normalize and these didn't address the issue. Update I wrote a unit test that does nothing but validate the Document, adds the attribute and revalidates the Document. This passes. However, when I run the integration test that passes the Document through the whole system it fails per the above. Again, converting to a String and back to a Document passes validation. The code is not in a location that I can paste it here and it seems that it is a broader issue since the unit test passes. Any suggestions on where to investigate would be helpful.
Is java function returning values via exception a best practice or does it have any disadvantage? My requirement is a java DAO function returns me a collection of data with limited size(basically lazy loading). I need to get total size of the collection. So what I thought was if I pass a flag to the java DAO function for total count, the challenge thing was to return the count from the java DAO function. Is it ok to get the count through exception? Is this a good approach? Any other solution is always welcome. EDIT: The reason to go with exception was: Let me explain the use case: I have an action layer and a dao layer. Now in action layer I have used around "5 (if , else) condition" to get different types of data collection WITH limited count from DB. Now my next action task was to get the total count of the collection WITHOUT limited count. How to do was the question avoiding more number of if conditions. So what I thought was to use EXCEPTION to return total count and handle clean in action layer. Here I need either total count or data list.
I have repeatedly got the java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error when compiling my android project on IntelliJ Idea. I increased my java heap space by following the link here however that didn't solve the problem. The funny thing is, at times my app will compile, and at other times the app will not compile due to the java heap space error. Even when I have made no changes to the app, it will compile at times and fail at times. Any idea as to how I can solve this problem? I am compiling an android project, could it be due to the large amount or resources (drawable hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, large-hdpi, large-xhdpi, large-xxhdpi) that I have? But then again, like I said it compiles at times and at times it doesn't. I'm down to making about 10 attempts to compile each time and luckily it will be successful once. Here is the error: Internal error: (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError) Java heap space java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at java.util.Arrays.copyOf(Arrays.java:2271) at com.intellij.util.io.UnsyncByteArrayOutputStream.write(UnsyncByteArrayOutputStream.java:52) at com.intellij.util.io.DataOutputStream.write(DataOutputStream.java:34) at java.io.FilterOutputStream.write(FilterOutputStream.java:97) at com.intellij.util.io.IOUtil.writeString(IOUtil.java:63) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.storage.OneToManyPathsMapping$PathCollectionExternalizer.save(OneToManyPathsMapping.java:87) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.storage.OneToManyPathsMapping$PathCollectionExternalizer.save(OneToManyPathsMapping.java:84) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.storage.AbstractStateStorage$1.append(AbstractStateStorage.java:103) at com.intellij.util.io.PersistentHashMap.doAppendData(PersistentHashMap.java:371) at com.intellij.util.io.PersistentHashMap.appendData(PersistentHashMap.java:358) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.storage.AbstractStateStorage.appendData(AbstractStateStorage.java:101) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.storage.OneToManyPathsMapping.appendData(OneToManyPathsMapping.java:50) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.storage.SourceToOutputMappingImpl.appendOutput(SourceToOutputMappingImpl.java:50) at org.jetbrains.jps.builders.impl.BuildOutputConsumerImpl.registerOutputFile(BuildOutputConsumerImpl.java:65) at org.jetbrains.jps.android.AndroidResourceCachingBuilder.runPngCaching(AndroidResourceCachingBuilder.java:126) at org.jetbrains.jps.android.AndroidResourceCachingBuilder.build(AndroidResourceCachingBuilder.java:48) at org.jetbrains.jps.android.AndroidResourceCachingBuilder.build(AndroidResourceCachingBuilder.java:32) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.BuildOperations.buildTarget(BuildOperations.java:100) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.IncProjectBuilder.runBuildersForChunk(IncProjectBuilder.java:744) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.IncProjectBuilder.buildTargetsChunk(IncProjectBuilder.java:770) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.IncProjectBuilder.buildChunkIfAffected(IncProjectBuilder.java:702) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.IncProjectBuilder.buildChunks(IncProjectBuilder.java:523) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.IncProjectBuilder.runBuild(IncProjectBuilder.java:314) at org.jetbrains.jps.incremental.IncProjectBuilder.build(IncProjectBuilder.java:179) at org.jetbrains.jps.cmdline.BuildRunner.runBuild(BuildRunner.java:129) at org.jetbrains.jps.cmdline.BuildSession.runBuild(BuildSession.java:220) at org.jetbrains.jps.cmdline.BuildSession.run(BuildSession.java:112) at org.jetbrains.jps.cmdline.BuildMain$MyMessageHandler$1.run(BuildMain.java:132) at org.jetbrains.jps.service.impl.SharedThreadPoolImpl$1.run(SharedThreadPoolImpl.java:41) at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471) at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask$Sync.innerRun(FutureTask.java:334) at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:166) Thanks in advance!
So this is regarding an interview question I was recently asked. The interviewer started on this by asking me how we create our custom Exceptions. On answering that, he asked me how I'd create a RunTimeExceptions. I said we'd create them in the same way as we would create the checked Exceptions. Just our custom exception would extend from the RunTimeException class. Then he asked in what scenarios would you create your own RunTimeException. Now I couldn't think of a good answer to that. In none of my projects, we created custom RunTimeExceptions. I also think that we should never create RunTimeExceptions. JVM can fail only in a finite number of ways and it handles them well. While writing an application we can't predict what runtime exceptions can occur and hence we shouldn't need to handle them. And if we can predict those conditions, they aren't RunTimeExceptions then. Since we neither need new runtime exceptions, nor need a handling of runtimeexceptions, why would we ever need to create a custom RunTimeException. Everything that we can pre-think of as a possible failure condition should be handled at compile time and it would be a checked exception. Right? Only the things that cannot be handled at compile time and the ones that depend on run time things go into the category of RunTimeExceptions. Even if we write custom RunTimeExceptions and then a custom method that should throw that RunTimeException - how do we make sure that the method will throw that particular RunTimeException. How do we do that mapping. It doesn't seem possible to me. Am I missing something/ many things here? Kindly advice. Thanks, Chan.
I've been able to make the JNI sample work on OSX with one C file, such as in this tutorial. But when I try to make a makefile that links in other C files, I get the dreaded "UnsatisfiedLinkError".

Situation Every once and a while my application seems to be freezing. The only indication of this that I get is that my browser will say "Waiting for localhost...". If I restart my browser and access my application it continues waiting. The only solution so far has been to turn off Tomcat then turn it back on. The problem then vanishes. I'm very confident this is a server side process that has taken over and nothing client-side. Problem Rather than only analyzing my code it would be nice to actually inspect what is Tomcat doing or working on at any given time, kind of like a "Tomcat Task manager". I suspect some process running in the background with the JVM is the culprit but I'm not sure how to go about analyzing that. Questions What's the best way of looking at what the Tomcat is doing when no web requests are being made? Any idea what background process or threads I should look into as a possible culprit? Possible Cause of Problem: This problem started as soon as I started using a singleton across multiple pages. Before I commit to that as the cause I'd like to track down where the freezing is actually taking place.

I am working on moving code from R2007a to R2013a. I am getting a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError during my run in R2013a which does not appear in R2007a. It occurs when I call. feval('get',fname,jevent); Where fname is a product.ProxyField object for an Object Filter and jevent is a product.format.java.internal.JavaEvent. The class is in a jar file on the path and is being accessed by another class in the same jar file. The stack trace does not leave the realm of the product if that helps. I do not have access to the original code for the jar file. I do have access to code derived from that original code and both classes are in the same package. I'm guessing this has something to do with differences in the java version but I'm not sure what to do since I don't have the original code to recompile. Unfortunately I can't provide actual source or full detail but a google search only yielded results for MATLAB startup issues. Any thoughts?
I have read some information on when to use assert and when to use an exception. What is unclear to me is Why ? eg: Assertions are intended to be used solely as a means of detecting programming errors, aka bugs. By contrast, an exception can indicate other kinds of error or "exceptional" condition; e.g. invalid user input, missing files, heap full and so on. Now: "Assertions are intended to be used solely as a means of detecting programming errors, aka bugs "- Now whats that harm is all asserts were replaced by exceptions ? Exceptions would do the same thing ? "Assert is for debugging purpose only and its trigger condition should not happen." - : Now Well if I use exceptions then execptions then exceptions would never be thrown From my understanding exceptions can do everything asserts to except they cannot be disabled. Is disabling asserts the ONLY reason why they should be used ? Is there a reason WHY to use them rather than WHEN to use them ? Thanks
I have a Java EE web application developed in an old version of Eclipse (Ganymede if I remember correctly). I recently migrated to Kubuntu 12.04 LTS and migrated the application to Eclipse Kepler (which I downloaded and installed from the Eclipse website). It is using Java Compliance Level 1.6 and the target container is Tomcat 6. My problem is that I now receive the error: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: operator does not exist: integer = character varying when the application encounters a page with a certain Postgres query in it. I'm using the JSTL sql:query and sql:param tags to implement a prepared statement within the jsp page. I know this is considered bad practice, but I'm not the original author and this technique is used throughout the application. The error occurs because of trying to assign a string to an integer in the sql:param tag. In the previous setup any casting happened transparently and there was no error. With the new setup I receive the error. I read that more strict type casting was introduced with Postgres 8.3 which would cause this error, but I am using the Postgres 8.2 JDBC 4 jar file within my application so it should work. I am stumped. Perhaps someone has an idea? I came across a workaround, to multiply the string by 1 before making the comparison: http://dev-answers.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/type-coercion-in-jstl-for-sqlparam.html But this is a bit of a kludge and I would have many pages to modify. But it is academic because I should not be experiencing the problem anyway. Thanks for reading. Any help greatly appreciated.
I downloaded Eclipse Juno a while ago but until now used its Java SE perspective only. Today I downloaded GlassFish 4 for Windows and installed it. During installation I got a screen that showed that installation process didn't find Java JDK but allowed to browse for it. I found C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_17 directory and selected it. i finished the installation and was able to start and stop domain and see both application and admin pages. I also wanted to install GlassFish plug-in for Eclipse. I found it through Marketplace and downloaded and installed it. I switched Eclipse's perspective to JavaEE and tried to pick GlassFish as a server. Such option was indeed there. However, I then got a screen titled New GlassFish 4.0 Runtime with the following error: Glassfish server runtime requires full JDK instead of JRE The only enabled buttons are Back and Cancel. I Googled around but didn't find anything useful for such case. Can somebody guess what could have happened and suggest troubleshooting steps?
I'm working on a service to prepare spreadsheet for a report. I'm using jxl-2.4.2.jar to achieve this ( please note that I can't use the latest version due to compatibility constraints). When I execute the code locally on my eclipse it works fine. My eclipse has java 1.5. When I deploy my code in my test environment, its giving NoClassdefFound error for jxl.* ( any classes in jxl ). My test environment has IBM's java 1.5. I believe it doesn't make any difference if I use IBM's version or Sun's version of java in this context. I believe this error could happen when JVM fails to load the class at runtime or if the class has any static methods/properties. I checked the classes and none of them have static contents. So, this could be something else. FYI.. I'm using ant to build the project & I check the build.xml. It is showing the correct version of java 1.5. Could someone please help to fix this error? Also Just FYI.. my project resides on AIX 5.0 server. Any help in this regard much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Say we have a method changeUserName(Long id,String newName) which invokes the repository's findUser(Long id) to find the right user entity and then change its name. Is it appropriate to thow an IllegalArgmentException when findUser returns null ? Or should I instead throw a custom UserNotExistException (extends AppException extends RuntimeException) ? UPDATE: RuntimeException: @nachokk @JunedAhsan Actually I deliberately make all the exceptions unchecked , because I think this way makes client code clean , easy for debuging and more safe. As to those "unhandled" ones, I'll catch them all on the top of layers thus avoiding showing them on the UI. This is due to the fact that many clients catch checked exceptions and then just ignore it, and in some cases they don't know how to handle it. This is a hidden trouble. Clarification: Sorry for my bad English. What I meant is if the changeUserName should throw an IllegalArgumentException, not the findUser method. And another question: how to differentiate illegal argument from business rule violation?
I know that this theme was written a lot of, but I cannot find a solution in this threads. I have a bitmap with a HD size and want to rotate it. But if I create a new Bitmap with Bitmap.createBitmap (with the same resolution) I get a OutOfMemoryException. At this point I have only one Bitmap in usage in my app! If I search for this problem I found solutions with "call recycle()" or "set Options", but all this things do not work. The second problem is that the available memory is very great. I log the size of the available memory and get 451 MB. This is the last call before I create the new Bitmap in HD resolution. I believe that my app use at this moment ca. 30MB of memory. Ergo, my question: Is there a bug in the Bitmap.createBitmap method? If it is so, what is the work around? Thanks for your help.
I want to understand the way the validation chain works. What certs do I really need in my truststore? I have a chain with Root CA -> intermediate 1 -> intermediate 2 -> server cert. I have only the intermediate 2 cert in my truststore. On my one test machine this works all right, but on my other it does not (contacting a different server with similar configuration). I get this popular SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target Exception. The server sends the full chain. I guess the solution will be to put the whole chain up to Root CA to my truststore. I want to know why it works on one machine and not the other. Is it possible to have influence on how chain validation works? Can a server require full chain validation? I could not figure out, if the default truststore from jdk is automatically included or not. The 2 machines have slightly different jdk versions 1.7.0_21 (not working) and 1.7.0_25 (working). Does it matter? One more thing: this SunCertPathBuilderException - is it possible to find out which part of the chain he does not like? I am happy for any hints. Thanks, Heike
I'm having a problem in my Android app and didn't find any related topic in the forum (maybe I just didn't know how to look for it) I have a project that generates a .jar file with some classes I use in two other projects (basically a server-client structure, the Android app being the client). I have built another project in order to test specifically this generated .jar, and it works fine. When I add it to the android app I can declare and use the classes having no compilation problem, but when I execute the app (using BlueStacks) I get this ClassNotFoundException. If I keep clicking "Resume" I get also a NoClassDefFound exception when trying to instantiate one of the classes from the generated .jar. Is there any extra configuration (other than including it in the build path) I have to make to be able to use or generate this .jar? I'm using Eclipse Kepler, Android 4.2.2 and Java 1.7.
-Hi I'm using the Zebra Link-OS SDK to play around with a QLn-320 mobile printer. I have not altered any of the code. The printer is able to communicate through a network but not via USB. It is using the ZDesigner QLn320 driver on a USB port. I know the problem isn't the USB because I am able to perform SGD commands via Zebra Toolbox as well as print documents through notepad. The sample code should print out a 60 byte sample logo, instead the application returns "Communications error" in the form of a red label. It doesn't even seem to read anything from the printer as I don't get anything returned by doing a SGD command. It seems to work about 1% of the time and other times it shows the blinking folder icon but nothing happens. I've tried all the firmwares for the printer listed on Zebra's website including the latest one. I've tried deleting the project, re-importing it, cleaning it, and even using NetBeans, but nothing seems to work. The bug seems to be in the SDK. Any ideas? Thanks!
Using NetBeans IDE 7.3.1, I modified a desktop application under Windows 7, using JDK 1.7. Performed clean and build, and tested this application under Windows 7, Windows XP, and on a MAC. All test scenarios run under each operating system performed as expected. This app is ported to outside vendors, and all vendors, except for one, have loaded and executed the app without any issues. The one vendor encountering problems, and running under Windows XP, returns an error message - "Could Not find or load main class". After doing a little research, this error usually indicates the JDK is different. They downloaded and installed JDK 1.7, but the same error message appears. I had them go to http://javatester.org/othertesters.html, making sure that java was working on the workstation and verifying the java version (1.7). They reinstalled JDK 1.7 and still receive the same error. I have duplicated the error by removing JDK 1.7, loading JDK 1.6 and running the app. Receive error ("Could Not find main class"). A little different than what they receive, but basically the same problem. Removed JDK 1.6, loaded JDK 1.7 and problem disappears. I'm at my wits end! I am going to make an appt. to access their workstation. But before I do, I would like to put a plan in place to try different scenarios to fix the problem. I don't know how to proceed, since I've run out of options. I'm hoping for any suggestions.
I'm trying to use the Java Google Drive API in a servlet in Google App Engine (GAE) and get a NoClassDefFoundError when the servlet is first loaded in the (localhost) server in Eclipse. As a test, I tried to create an instance of GoogleClientSecrets class in my servlet. Eclipse compiler doesn't complain, I have C:\app\gDrive\libs**google-api-client-1.16.0-rc.jar** in the Java Build Path, google-api-client-1.16.0-rc.jar contains the package com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2 which contains GoogleClientSecrets. The (localhost) server in the Google plugin in Eclipse loads as usual. When I the servlet class is first loaded (when the first request to it is made), I get the NoClassDefFoundError. If I comment out the reference to GoogleClientSecrets, the servlet works fine. google-api-client-1.16.0-rc.jar is in the Eclipse -> Java Build Path -> Libraries list as an external jar file. It is 'check' marked in the Order and Export tab (which I think means that the jar file should be packaged in the war file -- an should be available to the server environment. Is there some restriction on the use of these classes in GAE at run time? Is there something different about the classpath of the class loader for the server or servlets? (In a standalone Java application the code works fine for accessing the Google Drive (ie I have all the needed jars in that Java Application environment -- something is odd in the server (I think that is the Jetty server). Update How DevAppServer finds classes (As Mark Doyle points out) the DevAppServer's class loading scheme is wholly different for loading classes used by the webapp from the class loading scheme used to load the DevAppServer code itself -- And the web app class loading scheme is not the usual Eclipse project buildpath process. (I'm documenting how all this works here, for clarity, and so I can find it again.) Looking into it I see that when loading classes for a webapp, DevAppServer calls a Google class 'IsolatedAppClassLoader' (to isolate the class loading of each webapp from each other. IsolatedAppClassLoader.loadClass() calls DevAppServerClassLoader.loadClass(), which (in most cases) eventually calls its superclass java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(), which, in this case calls java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass() which calls URLClassPath.getResource() which is where much of the work begins. URLClassPath.getResource() has a 'for' loop which gets each loader listed in the URLClassPath object. In this case there are 17 (!seventeen) loaders in for the URLClassPath, all of the instances of sun.misc.URLClassPath$JarLoader (subclass of URLClassPath). -- These seem to be DevAppServer jars. My class is not found, a ClassNotFoundException is returned (at this level). IsolatedAppClassLoader does this again (I don't understand why, but this time directly with the URLClassLoader object (the run() method), something about PrivilegedExceptionAction.run()??)) In any event, URLClassPath (from an anonymous subclass of URLClassLoader ??) runs URLClassPath.getResource(), (this the IsolatedAppClassLoader instance is a subclass of URLClassLoader!). The IsolatedAppClassLoader instance contains a 'ucp' field (URLClassPath sub object) with 21 loaders. The first is a FileLoader instance (subclass of URLClassPath) which contains the url file: /C:/eclip/webAppName/war/WEB-INF/classes/ -- so this is where it finds all the individual classes in the war/WEB-INF/classes directory. The remaining 20 loaders are all JarLoader loaders. Of that 15 correspond to the 15 .jar files in the project's war/WEB-INF directory. The remaining 5 JarLoader instances are: file:/C:/app/eclipse/plugins/com.google.appengine.eclipse.sdkbundle_1.8.2/appengine-java-sdk-1.8.2/lib/impl/agent/appengine-agentruntime.jar!/ file:/C:/app/eclipse/plugins/com.google.appengine.eclipse.sdkbundle_1.8.2/appengine-java-sdk-1.8.2/lib/tools/jsp/repackaged-appengine-jakarta-jstl-1.1.2.jar!/ file:/C:/app/eclipse/plugins/com.google.appengine.eclipse.sdkbundle_1.8.2/appengine-java-sdk-1.8.2/lib/tools/jsp/repackaged-appengine-jakarta-standard-1.1.2.jar!/ file:/C:/app/eclipse/plugins/com.google.appengine.eclipse.sdkbundle_1.8.2/appengine-java-sdk-1.8.2/lib/tools/jsp/repackaged-appengine-jasper-jdt-6.0.29.jar!/ file:/C:/app/eclipse/plugins/com.google.appengine.eclipse.sdkbundle_1.8.2/appengine-java-sdk-1.8.2/lib/opt/tools/appengine-local-endpoints/v1/appengine-local-endpoints.jar!/ I don't know why these are on the list, probably some standard stuff for Jetty?
I've just started learning how to load XML files and use them to create objects a bit yesterday and so I've run into a few little things that I haven't, through about 15 minutes or so of looking around, been able to figure out so I decided to try asking them here. DBLoader: https://github.com/Valkryst/Project_02/blob/master/src/main/java/valkryst/item/DBLoader.java#L93 XMLParse: https://github.com/Valkryst/Project_02/tree/master/src/main/java/valkryst/core/xml The DBLoader class is where I load all of the variables from the XML file and create either an Armor or a Weapon object depending on a few things. The XMLParse class is just to hold a few methods that I've found myself in need of quite often while working with XML files. Now onto my two questions... How can I, with how my code is currently set up in the DBLoader class, do a check to see if there are no elements other than the opening and closing elements which are "body" and "/body"? (Replace the quotation marks with > and <.) How can I resolve the error "[Fatal Error] :1:1 Premature end of file" when loading an empty file? I've already included a try-catch block to skip the current iteration of the for loop after it's caught. (This will probably be fixed if my first question is solved.) I did have more questions and that but it's around 4:00am here so I'm a bit out-of-it and I'll leave it at the two most important questions I had. Thanks for any replies. Edit: Another error just cropped up that I can't seem to figure out in my tired state of mind so I'll just add it to this post just in case anyone sees the problem while helping with my main questions. When DBLoader is run it always seems to skip "/XML/Items/Armor/Boot.xml" for some reason. I've added a print statement to tell me when a file is successfully loaded but only "/XML/Items/Armor/Sword.xml" ever successfully finishes. They are my two test XML files so only they should successfully load. Sorry if this sounds weird, I'm falling asleep.
I am trying to read and write .xslx files using Apache POI. My program picks up data from workbooks stored in a folder & writes it to another file.

I am new to Android NFC development.I have created android application which using ISOdep send data to java card.In my java card applet i get data from APDU command and encrypted data using RSA2048 and send back to Android application.So I am using NEXUS S and Jcop 81 card for the testing.My problem is when i remove the java card while processing encryption the Android device(nexus s) gives wired sound.After that i try to tap again then always it gives this wired sound.And then I reset java card using JCOP tools and tap again.now it works fine.In here How to Reset java card using APDU command i asked how to reset java card before we selecting applet.But android or java card API doesn't support for the RESET.How can i solve this problem.Is there are any way like begin transaction and endtransaction like in javax.smartcardio Or Is there any other way to do this process??Other thing i want to know is this problem common for all android devices?

I have just started using Spring Data REST in our Spring MVC application to reduce the work required for having REST HATEOAS support for our API. This worked almost instantly for top level entities - where we could return all items, PUT/POST new items, or return a specific item by ID. The issue I'm having now is when trying to follow the link provided to show a collection that is mapped to an entity that I have returned. I'm having an 'org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: no Session' being thrown - I presume as it traverses the parent object into the collection (which is lazy loaded). Googling around for the problem suggests enabling the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter - however we are reluctant to enable this for our project, as we have had bad experiences before with that causing dead locks with the database connections. Can anyone provide a hint as to perhaps a configuration option I might be missing, or something I'm missing from the documentation as to have these links correctly navigate the collection. Regards, Andy
I'm helping my kid learn to create Minecraft plugins, although I don't have much experience with Java or IDEA. Everything is working well so far, but in order to execute our code, we have to: Make the project in IDEA (output path is set to Bukkit/plugins) Run Bukkit server Start Minecraft and connect I'm not sure that anything can be done about (3), but it seems to me that IDEA should be able to handle (1) & (2) in a single step. Also, we cannot presently debug using this configuration. In Visual Studio / .NET, I would just need to specify the executable -- java/craftbukkit, in this case -- as an "external program", and it would solve all of these problems. In IDEA, though, it seems that I am supposed to add a Run Configuration, and I don't see an option which allows anything like a "host application." Instead, it wants the full classpath to the main for Bukkit, and it isn't clear to me what that would be. I have also seen it suggested elsewhere that even this won't work without a debug build of Bukkit. but I don't really want to debug Bukkit; I just want to debug our plugin code only. I found these instructions for remote debugging Bukkit plugins, but is that actually necessary? It doesn't solve the "two steps to run" problem; it actually makes it worse!
My problem is following: In one entity class I have added NamedQuery that didn't compile well at the time of application deployment to server. The problem was that I was using wrong entity name in it's JPQL statement, so I've decided to remove that problematic NamedQuery for the time being, while I consider some alternative. So, everything went on normal, the application was working fine, when all of the sudden, I started getting the same error I've got when I tried to deploy entity bean with afore-mentioned problematic NamedQuery. Funny thing is that such NamedQuery does not exist anywhere in my code - I've removed all references to it, so there's no way it could still get deployed to server, but somehow it does. It's like the Glassfish holds it's own copy of those entity beans and keeps deploying them, although they were modified in the meantime. Feel free to ask me for any additional info regarding this problem.
I have a problem that I can't figure out. Context : was 7.0.0.19 version (with no preCompileJsp) Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/jsp/_xxx (wrong name: com/ibm/_jsp/_xxx) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassImpl(Native Method) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:275) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:212) at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionClassLoader.defClass(JSPExtensionClassLoader.java:181) at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionClassLoader._loadClass(JSPExtensionClassLoader.java:133) It's the only JSP that give problem, and only on a specific environment (no problem on the others environments with the same configuration) the xxx.class is well present in my profile/tmp directory with others jsp in the same directory (that all give no problem) and the filesystem is not full. Tests I did a copy of xxx.jsp to xxxNew.jsp in the same directory I can access the xxxNew.jsp without any problem (so there is no coding problem) So I did a mv from xxx.jsp to xxx1.jsp and had no problem to access the jsp new named I deleted the xxx.class in the tmp directory I did the mv back to the first name (xxx.jsp) and still get the error with a newly xxx.class in the tmp directory. Is there a class cache anywhere in websphere that could explain this ? (no cachespec.xml for dynacache found in the war module). Why Websphere try to find a class from the org.apache.jsp package and not from com.ibm._jsp ? (how the AS choose the mapping from the URL to the classes ?) Thxs !
OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Web Server: IIS 7.5 JSP/Servlet Engine: Tomcat 5.5.28 (32-bit) PHP: 5.4.14 Java: JRE SE 1.6.0_20 (32-bit) Apache Isapi Connector hooks into Tomcat from IIS PHP-Java Bridge 6.2.1 BMC AR System 7.5 Patch 6 Tomcat Initial and Max Memory: 1024 MB, 1024 MB I am using a Java web application called AR System. After installing the PHP-Java Bridge, I started seeing java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space error in the Tomcat logs. (I see in Windows Task Manager that there are 6 PHP-CGI.exe processes, all similar in memory footprint, give or take 5 MB). It would occur every other day or so and then shortened to every day, sometimes twice a day. Consequently, the application hangs and I have to restart it. And I added a Windows Task to restart Tomcat during non-peak hours to give me some cushion. I suspected a memory leak and started doing some research. Normally, Tomcat sits at around 300-350 MB. With the PHP-Java Bridge, memory jumped up significantly. In fact, the error has occurred anywhere from 450-600 MB. I learned that default PermGen is 64MB and PermGen should be set to 1/4, up to 1/3 of Tomcat memory (sorry, I don't recall the link). Tomcat is running under Windows Services at this point, and I added the following to its properties: -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:PermSize=128M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M I enforced GC on PermGen memory and increased the size from the default 64 MB size to 128-256 MB. Memory went up all the way to 800-850 MB, slowly, but it wasn't hanging during peak hours, albeit I still had Tomcat intentionally restart during non-peak hours, via a Windows Task. If I take off the restart, it MIGHT eventually hang but I haven't tried it. I still suspected a memory leak. I installed a trial version of AppDynamics to monitor the application, its memory, and run leak detection. Additionally, to use tools like VisualVM and Memory Analyzer (MAT), I disabled The Tomcat Windows service and ran Tomcat from the Windows Command Line, via catalina.bat. I appended Java Options to the file; I made sure Tomcat memory was 1024 MB, Perm Gen was 128/256 MB, and ensured PHP-Java Bridge and AppDynamics was running. As of right now, PermGen is holding at 163 MB used, and AppDynamic's Automatic Leak Detection did not detect any leaks with any Java Collections. I fired up MAT, created a heap dump and analyzed for leaks. When I ran it yesterday, it found three possible suspects: net.sf.ehcache.Cache net.sf.ehcache.store.DiskStore org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader When I ran it today, it found 2 possible suspects: java.util.HashMap org.apache.jasper.servlet.JasperLoader So, with MAT and AppDynamics, it appears that no memory leaks were detected for classes directly related to the PHP-Java Bridge JAR files. I haven't tried using Plumbr, but I can't find the free beta version. The free version detects leaks, but you have to pay to see it. Again, I don't have a source link at this time, but I recall reading that Tomcat 5.x can have performance and memory leak issues. Of course, that doesn't mean everybody will have those issues, just a select number. I know Tomcat 6 and Tomcat 7 redesigned their memory management or how they structure memory. I also did speak with someone from BMC, the maker of AR System, and they said the current version of AR System I'm using could suffer from performance and memory issues. But, again, none of this was a problem before the PHP-Java Bridge. It was only after I installed it that this PermGen memory issue started. Since the tools above did not report any leaks, does that mean there are no leaks and PHP-Java Bridge just needed more than 64 MB PermGen memory? Or, is there an inherit problem with my version of Tomcat and installing the PHP-Java Bridge just broke the proverbial camel's back? Upgrading to a newer version of AR System and Tomcat is not an option. If there is a leak, I can uninstall the PHP-Java Bridge or continue trying to find a leak and fix it. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you. Update 1 With MAT, I looked at the thread overview and stacks and you can see below that the PHP-Java Bridge contributes about 2/3 of the total heap memory of Tomcat. That's a lot of memory! I think there is a leak, I do. I can't find any information on the PHP-Java Bridge having inherit memory leak issues. But, to me, it appears that the problem is not that Tomcat is leaking. Ideas? AppDynamics couldn't find any leaks, even when I manually added classes that were suspected in MAT. What I'm wondering is perhaps the PermGen error is a symptom of that case where the program has no leak and needs more PermGen memory allotted. It would be helpful to know if the PHP-Java Bridge is designed to eat a lot of memory, this much memory; maybe it's optimized for 64-bit, since the current setup is a 32-bit Java Web application. If I knew that this bridge needs a lot of memory, I would say OK, fine, and go from there. But it certainly appears as if there is a memory leak somewhere in the chain. Update 2 I've been running Plumbr now for 2 hours and almost 10 minutes. I see that Tomcat memory is shooting up to 960 MB and probably will continue to climb. For those familiar with the program, the Java web application has been analyzed 3 times. So far, no leaks have been reported. If it stays this way, then the two conclusions I've arrived at are a) there are no leaks or b) there is a leak and, somehow, both AppDynamics and Plumbr missed it. If there are truly no leaks with this set of applications working together, then it must be that the Bridge uses a lot of memory and needs more PermGen memory than Tomcat's default, 64 MB -- at the very least, for 32-bit Java web applications.
I've created a small JAR library in Netbeans containing a few non-platform specific classes and interfaces. I then use this JAR file in an Android Eclipse project by placing it in the libs folder. I can then import any class or interface into the android code with no problem. I can also extend the Android View class and implement an interface contained with the JAR file and this custom View is displayed in the Layout editor (in Eclipse) with no problem. The problem comes when I attempt to run the app on the Emulator. It crashes and logcat gives a NoClassDefFoundError, complaining that it cannot resolve classes which are in the JAR file despite me including it in the build path. I originally built the JAR file targeting JDK 1.7 but I happened to try changing it to JDK 1.6 and then the app works. Has anyone else come across this? Is JDK 1.7 incompatible with Android? javac -version reports 1.7.0_17
Our Tomcat 6 Server is reporting quite a few ClientAbortException errors, which I believe is down to say a user navigating away from the page before its fully loaded. We are also getting No buffer space available (maximum connections reached? errors. Is there a way of creating a ClientAbortException Listener to terminate any Abandoned Connection Clean Up or unused http threads and delete any byte data used for incomplete downloaded images. This project is inherited and I've noticed that even when running locally if I start VisualJVM and view the monitor and then open a website locally I see an Abandoned Connection Clean Up thread created and a number of http threads created. If I open another website on the same local web server I can see yet again another Abandoned Connection Clean Up thread created and another set of http threads created. If I navigate through the pages, I don't see any other connections created, mainly because the project is using database pooling but if I close the browser the threads are still running, they are not being freed up. Needless to say, as soon as the server has been running for a number of days or is under load the aforementioned errors are generated. Any help would be much appreciated :-)
I'm using sqlite4java to handle with sqlite db. I want now to copy a table from database to dbtest. So I found the code here on stackoverflow. But I get always an error. First of all I open a connection to my new created database and afterwards I attach the other database with the following command: ATTACH DATABASE database AS database; This works fine. dbtest has been opended earliere as new database. Then I want to copy the tables: Hence, the table is already created and it is the same as in the other database. INSERT INTO dbtest.Routing (id, source, destination, metadata, zone_src, zone_dst,cost) SELECT * FROM database.Routing; But after executing this I get the error: com.almworks.sqlite4java.SQLiteException: [1] DB[1] exec() no such table: dbtest.Routing I tried it also with sqlite Studio and there it is working without any problems, but I cannot attach a database there (this is done automatically). Do I have to use another notation to use two databases? EDIT: I use now the answer from CL. But this leads to the new issue: com.almworks.sqlite4java.SQLiteException: [1] DB[1] exec() no such table: second.Routing What did I change? ATTACH DATABASE database AS second; //new name for the database file and it will be attached as second, because if I use the debug function it says: Database second already in use. If I use this command I get the error mentioned above. INSERT INTO Routing (id, source, destination, metadata, zone_src, zone_dst,cost) SELECT * FROM second.Routing; Problem solved by using the absolute path for the database file.
I'm in a process of writing a Bamboo plugin, the bulk of which is complete. The plugin works by starting a remote process off via a post request to a server and then polling the same server until it gets a message saying the process has completed or an error occurred - this part works. I would like to add some extra logic where I can notify this server if the user cancels the job, however I'm unsure of how to go about this. I have played about with creating another task which runs as a final task, however I don't know how to detect if any of the previous tasks failed or were cancelled. I have tried using List<TaskResult> taskResults = taskContext.getBuildContext().getBuildResult().getTaskResults(); to get a list of the previous Task's results, however this always appears to return 0 Task Results. I have also tried using a Post-Build Completed Action Module, however I'm unsure how I would add this to a job and the documentation on this has me slightly mystified. If anyone could help me in the right direction I would appreciate it.
I have came across this problem while installing rJava on R3.0.1: "configure: error: One or more JNI types differ from the corresponding native type" The detailed message is attached below.

I have a Java project which is divided into 3 modules. These three modules are separate Maven project but there is a dependency between them. The relationship is simple: Module A depends on Module B Module B depends on Module C Module C is a library which handles the low level database tasks like create session etc. Module B is a database library which defines DAOs, DTOs, Entities etc. Module A is a Restful Web Service which contains the business logic and uses library B to access the DB. I have a checked exception defined in Module C which is thrown by a public method. Module B can get this Exception. My question is that whether it is a good practice for B to Catch this checked exception and throw another checked exception defined locally in Module B to module A. Not catch the checked exception but declare this exception in its public method so that it is passed to module A. My personal opinion is that a module should only throw a checked exception it defines to its client modules unless is the Java's predefined exception. But there is certainly an draw back of this which means I have to create two different exceptions in multiple modules to represent a same error condition. Can anyone share your opinion?

Similarly to the question asked at How can I define a failover spring integration gateway? I have to implement the failover feature, however my expactations are different. I have two brokers: primary and secondary and one service that is running on the same servers either in PRIMARY or BACKUP mode. Synchronization of internal data is performed using SYNC queue. Within the service I would like to implement following functionality with Spring Integration: Each 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, ..., 5Q queue has a receiver and 1SQ queue has a sender. Both receiver and sender operate with primary broker (already implemented in Spring using message gateway & router for sender, and service activator for receiver). When a message from 1Q-5Q is received a new message is sent to 1SQ (this already works). In the same time the update of internal data is sent to SYNC queue. This way the interal data structures are synchronized in case of a failover. external module sends to the 1Q queue of the primary broker additional KeepAlive Message. If the message is not received after N secs. the new receiver and sender should be launched that operate with secondary broker. This way the receiver/sender take on the functionality of the primary broker. Questions: Obviously round-robin strategy is not suitable. Also automatic selection of secondary server as in question is not the way to go. That is why keepAlive message was chosen to detect whether the primary broker is down. Is it possible to have this functionality with Spring Integration? To be more precise: how to implement the switching between primary and secondary server for my senders/receivers when the keepAlive message is not received by the primary server? Is it possible to switch back to primary server when it is up&running again?
At one point, the remote debug used to work. But for the life of me, I don't seem to be able to figure out what broke it. I have a flex/Java application. There is a wrapper that starts the tomcat server. I modified the wrapper.conf file to include -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n In my flex debug configurations, on the left, I have Remote Java Application. On the right, I have Standard (Socket Attach) as the connection type, 127.0.0.1 (I have tried localhost too) as Host, and 8000 as Port. The following is the stack trace. !ENTRY org.eclipse.jdt.launching 4 113 2013-09-03 11:30:49.109 !MESSAGE Failed to connect to remote VM.

I had a brain meltdown over this problem last night. I started to debug my program after making sure there were no clear errors coming from my eclipse error check. I'm using Jre7 by the way. Anyway, each time i stepped into my class call(lets call it "a") the debugger would trip and say "class not found". However if i just run the debug without stepping into anything, there is no exception. Also if i step over the class call line, the program still initiates the class and all its members, and doesn't throw any exception. It is only when i reach that initial call " classA a = new A(); " that it stops and throws an exception. It also did this for a subclass i made inside of A. I couldn't step into that class either. Can anyone tell me what types of things can cause this? I am a beginner so please dumb it down a little if you can.
Figured I would ask here seeing as how Wowza's website is down for maintenance. Obviously for OPSEC "domainname" is filler for actual domain name which is domainname.com NOT the IP address. So I am getting a JMXConfig: error: java.io.IOException: Cannot bind to URL [rmi://domainname.com:8085/jmxrmi]: javax.naming.ConfigurationException {Root exception is java.rmi.UnknownHostException: Unknow host: domainname; nested exception is: java.net.UnknownHostException: domainname.com] Is this bind error from not port listening or some stupid configuration I messed up? Jconsole can't connect and I'm sure thats because of this startup server error. Jconsole I am using the follow info: Again, IPADDRESS is fill in for Server's (Host Gator) Shared IP Address. service:jmx:rmi://IPADDRESS:8084/jndi/rmi://IPADDRESS:8085/jmxrmi user: admin pass: admin Will it not connect because of the java error? And how do I fix. Thanks guys, first time messing with Wowza. My hope in getting all this to work is that via the Jconsole I can actually configure IP Camera IP Addresses that are currently working on a different system. And yes I have Transcoder pretty much setup.... I think.... Wowza isnt the easiest beast. Thanks
This unhelpful error message has been driving me crazy recently; it does not occur within the android emulator, only when running on my (android 2.3.6) device via USB debugging, launched from Eclipse. No exceptions are actually being thrown, and as far as I can tell none of my database queries are actually failing (everything seems to be working normally), yet I'm receiving at least one of these error for every query that I run. As far as I can tell I'm doing everything right: I'm using one SQLiteOpenHelper instance created as a singleton (synchronised static method retrieves a single instance using the application's context). I only call getWritableDatabase() when I need to run an update, insert etc., the rest of the time I use getReadableDatabase(). All actions that involve a writable database are also wrapped in transactions with a try/catch/finally block to ensure endTransaction() is called. All other queries are wrapped in a try/catch block to catch any possible SQLException responses, which are logged as appropriate. I am calling close() on all SQLiteDatabase and Cursor objects that I'm using. Most of these are things that used to throw background errors in the emulator until I corrected them, and when I run my app in the emulator I see no database errors of any kind any more. Yet running on my device I get the unhelpful "THIS SHOULD NEVER occur" errors seemingly for every single query I run, with no apparent ill effects. Of course I'm just ignoring these for the time being, but I can't think of any other possible causes. My SQL statements are all valid, and most of my code is based on the official android tutorials such as the one here. Can anyone identify why I would be getting these errors? What other possible causes are there?
Pardon the nebulous nature of this question. But I am out of patience and have no clues. The error is the infamous "Unfortunately (your program) has stopped". I am running relatively simple exercise program in Eclipse involving the actionbar and tabs. However, I am not posting the source because my program fails before it ever gets to my actual code. I toggled a breakpoint on my first "breakable" line of code; it never trips. There are no exceptions in the LogCat, and no errors on the Console. The Variable window shows a "NullPointerException" on variable "e". The source window states "Source Not Found" though I understand that is a generic error and doesn't necessarily mean anything. I have cleaned, built, saved, restarted, rebooted. I have tested other more complex programs successfully. I have deleted the \bin and the debug.keystore files and rebuilt. Nothing I do gives me a different error or any better clues as to what to look for. I'm no guru, but I can generally make my own way through java code. But I'm out of ideas here. Can any point me in the right direction?
I'm trying to implement Tab Navigation using ActionBarSherlock within my app. I've started with testing the code from this example in my app but it gives me errors related to the @Override methods (everything else seems to work fine, I also didn't have any problems with ActionBarSherlock in the same project before): The method onTabReselected(ActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction transaction) of type ReportActivity must override or implement a supertype method The method onTabSelected(ActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction transaction) of type ReportActivity must override or implement a supertype method The method onTabUnselected(ActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction transaction) of type ReportActivity must override or implement a supertype method I've tried changing public void onTabSelected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction transaction) to onTabSelected(com.actionbarsherlock.app.ActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction transaction) but it didn't help. I'm targeting my app to API level 17, which from what I've heard shouldn't be a problem for ActionBarSherlock.
I have created one keyspace and created the column family with some column names. And also added the records in that keyspace programmatically. Now I am going to add one more coulmn in that keysapce and added the new records. It was success... But while searching with that new column field value with equals operator.. I am getting the following exception me.prettyprint.hector.api.exceptions.HInvalidRequestException: InvalidRequestException(why:No indexed columns present in by-columns clause with "equals" operator) I think there are the rows which does not have the new column field... Is That make an issue?.. Could you please anyone help me to how to solve this problem?.... In Normal Relational database we can add null values to the existing records if any new column is added in the table... Is there anyway like that we can do with cassandra to solve this problem?.... My Final Result should be I can able to search the records with the new column field....

I am creating unchecked exceptions.What I have seen is that most exceptions call super().So I have followed the similar pattern. I want to know how to handle unchecked Exceptions(System defined and Custom) for logging purposes,for recovery of application or from that particular method,or any other Custom work ? I am working on multi threaded environment (Socket programming). Creating a main Thread which will create a Network Service which will create a ThreadPoolExecutor and open the socket and accept it in while loop and sends the tasks to Threads created by ThreadPoolExecutor. Now if one Thread throws unchecked exception,then depending on the severity of Unchecked Exception,I would either kill that thread or continue as it is,but logging in both cases. I am going to create only unchecked exceptions.If I catch the unchecked Exception then there would be no point of making it unchecked. So Is there any way to solve the problem. In Spring I have used @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler to manage Unchecked Exceptions.But I am not sure how to do this in Socket Programming. Please suggest and guide me with your experiences. Also,I have seen that many frameworks like Spring,Hibernate are moving towards Unchecked Exceptions by Wrapping Checked Exceptions in Unchecked Exception. Please don't suggest me to use checked Exceptions because it is a debatable topic.Sorry.
I have a question in reference to Apache Tomcat. I thought I knew what the issue was, but I will ask anyone who knows as a reference. I am working on a web application that makes numerous database calls for information manipulation. The application is connected to a MySQL server via straight jdbc. I have checked and may have possibly missed, but all of my resultSets, statements, and connections are closed when the methods are completed as far as I can tell. Yet, I get this recurring and troubling message from tomcat every time. The message is as follows: SEVERE: The web application [/myApplication] registered the JDBC driver [com.mysql.jdbc.Driver] but failed to unregister it when the web application was stopped. To prevent a memory leak, the JDBC Driver has been forcibly unregistered. Sep 11, 2013 12:33:40 PM org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader clearReferencesThreads SEVERE: The web application [/myApplication] appears to have started a thread named [Abandoned connection cleanup thread] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak. Sep 11, 2013 12:33:40 PM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext reload. If anyone has any insight into exactly what this this issue is, it would be most appreciated. If it helps, I have connections to 4 different databases within the MySQL database, I don't known whether or not that makes a difference, but just throwing it out there. Thanks all.

I know there are similar questions posted before and I went through those but still its not working for me. I am creating a sample JMS test class (chat application) and uses javaee.jar and javax.jms.jar. I can test it through Eclipse IDE and it works fine. But I am trying to run through command prompt so I can run multiple windows.I managed to compile the Chat.java file and it created the Chat.class. But when i try to run it, I get could not find or load main class. These are the commands I used: From the src/domain folder: javac -classpath javaee.jar;javax.jms.jar Chat.java---- this created Chat.Class inside domain folder where domain is the package name The I ran the following command from src folder java -classpath javaee.jar;javax.jms.jar domain.Chat ---- this gives me the could not find or load main class domain.Chat error message But when I run without the -classpath parameter(java domain.Chat), it reads the main() and gives me different error since it cant find the jms jar files. E:\eclipse\Spring\JMSChat\src>java domain.Chat Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/jms/MessageList ener So basically it finds the Chat.class file when I don't pass in the classpath parameter and it cannot find the class when I use the classpath to add the jars. I tried running it from within domain folder as well as from src folder, but no luck. Any clue what I am doing wrong? Thanks in advance.

We use a 3rd party JAR which contains an Applet class. When used in an HTML page you pass this applet the name of your 'application' class and an assets .zip file path as parameters, and the applet instantiates and runs your specified class. I need to debug the initialization of our app when started as an applet, but since the applet class is in a JAR, not part of our source I don't know how I can do this... I can't select MyApplet.java and say "run as Applet". I really want to be able to launch an actual HTML page with the applet parameters in, with a breakpoint set in Eclipse so it will halt in our application-class constructor. Is it possible to tell eclipse to debug an HTML file like this? A valid alternative would be to instance the Applet class in a normal Java application manually. There are other questions about debugging applets, but this seemed a different case since the Applet isn't part of our code.

I just thought of something minor I would like to do and was curious if it the ability to do it existed. It's purely a convenience syntactic-sugar sort of thing, hardly mandatory to have, but a slight convenience I thought may have been implemented at some point. I have a method nestled 2-3 layers down in helper methods of a Junit test case which throws a checked exception. I know for a fact that I want to fail if this exception is ever thrown. However, if I just call Fail() I lose the stack trace of the exception and the other conveniences that come with allowing the exception to propagate I know the 'standard' approach is to have the method throw the exception. However, as I said, I'm buried a few methods deep already, and I suspect this method will be called by many future helper methods. If I throw an exception in this method I will have to constantly adding a throw clause to all the methods that use this one method, directly or indirectly, which could be quite a few methods. This is obviously doable, just a little annoying; and, in theory at least, I could mask a situation where the exception is thrown and I actually wanted to catch it if all my methods already throw it. Is there a way I can tell JUnit to act as if the exception had propagated up to the top level and fail, without having to have all my methods throw it? So JUnit reports a failure due to exception, with the stack trace and all, immediately. Essentially I want a fail method that takes an exception. Does anything like this exist, or do I have to simply throw it? ps. I know I could wrap it in a RuntimeException and re-throw it, but I don't really like that option either.
I'm transitioning from Eclipse to IntelliJ Idea and having some trouble getting my Maven Web project running as I'd like. In Eclipse, I ran it using mvn tomcat:run, which worked fine with JSP debugging. In IntelliJ, I created a run configuration to use this command, and it works, but JSP debugging doesn't work. I tried to find info on getting JSP debugging to work on IntelliJ, and the only info I found involved setting up a Tomcat server in IntelliJ, not using Maven's tomcat with mvn tomcat:run. The problem is, I can't figure out how to do this without IntelliJ using it's own builder instead of building the project with Maven. I can add Maven goals like "mvn compile", but when I set it to deploy exploded war, and adds 'build myproject:war exploded artifact' to the build queue, which calls IntelliJ's builder. IntelliJ's builder takes forever to build my project. I've never even let it finish. To be fair, the project is huge, but Maven builds to fairly quickly. Also, everyone in my company is using Maven to build it, so I need to use Maven as well. Can anyone help me either get JSP debugging working using mvn tomcat:run, or on an Intellij managed Tomcat with the project built by Maven?
I recently being assign to a new department and to my worst nightmare, i am asked to support a piece of website coded with ZK with no documentation, no handover, and no one knows the system. But, i am blessed with the laptop where the previous developer develop this system on. With a few days of linking the bots, i manage to found out that this website is indeed written in ZK, Birt Report and the IDE is Eclipse Galileo 3.5.1 I have quite a bit of knowledge in Spring, hence i am able to hack the code to only certain extend. I hit a road block in Eclipse IDE, everytime it is trying to render the ZK pages so i can modify the screen. I always getting the "Fail to render : Page not found: /common_script.zul" error when i am on the ZUL Visual Editor. Any idea where should i start to be able to render the ZK page? I find manually edit the .zul XML is pretty much impossible for the enhancements i need to do. The ZK version is "ZK 5.0.5 2010110316" base on the view page source.
Having an issue with the product I code for where our licensing service is unable to find a host MAC address. We don't have much idea why this is happening and it is only happening to very small percentage of users. The method to get this MAC address is using the Java NetworkInterface methods. If this fails and returns NULL (or users JRE is <1.6) we then fall back to using Sigar to get our address. However it seems this is also failing. The problem is either that it can't obtain the IP address (and then further to this can't get the MAC address) or just can't get the MAC. This issue is happening across all OS' we support (AIX, Solaris, Win7/8, Win Server, Linux & MAC). As such, my first thought was that these users were enabling the Java security manager (as this is a common factor), but this is looking less likely as I try to reproduce it as this requires a lot of extra configuration steps with permissions to even get our product to run. As such we would have expected to see users asking us for what they need to enable to get our software to run, but this does not happen. As such I am wondering what is causing this to fail. My only lead now is that it is something lower level (within the OS) that is being enabled to block Java's attempts to natively get this information. I am searching for this now, but it is slow going and an odd thing to search for. My question is, is this kind of behavior possible (i.e. disabling calling of native methods to discover network info to anything other than trusted code within the OS?), on any/some of the platforms listed above? Has anyone had this problem before with Java NetworkInterface methods?
During JNI invocation , I am persistently hitting this issue of "Detailed error: #,# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.,# Native memory allocation (malloc) failed to allocate 18446744073203188961 bytes for GetStringUTFChars,# ". I have verified that the variable being read by GetStringUTFChars is only 3 character long, so I am sure this is a garbage value provided in the error thrown by JNI.

I created a runnable .jar file from a project I built in Eclipse Juno. The project uses the JRE7 and JavaFX libraries, which I added to the build path. Build Path Settings The .jar file executes successfully on Windows 7 machines. However, when I try to run the .jar file on a WindowsXP machine, it fails with the following linking error: Error on WindowsXP The error reads: Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: com.sun.glass.ui.win.WinApplication._invokeLater(Ljava/lang/Runnable;)V at com.sun.glass.ui.win.WinApplication._invokeLater(Native Method) at com.sun.glass.ui.Application.invokeLater(Application.java:338) at com.sun.javafx.tk.quantum.QuantumToolkit.defer(QuantumToolkit.java:620) The error occurs just as the program tries to load a class that uses JavaFX, The WindowsXP machine has Java Version 7 Update 40 which comes with JavaFX, so I can't figure out why it would fail. Could this be a 32-bit vs. 64-bit problem? Also, on the build path settings, I wonder if I'm including the right JavaFX jar file. I have two to choose from and I'm not exactly sure which one to include. I assume it's the second one because it's part of the JRE. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_25\jre\lib\jfxtr.jar C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\lib\jfxtr.jar Thanks
I have a folder of source files (say src/main/java), which contains two super-packages: com.blah.generated com.blah.software The com.blah.generated code is generated by a tool which cannot be run at every compilation and is checked in to version control. We never change it, it is occasionally re-generated when there's a new dependency on a new release. The generated code has 100s of warnings, which I want to get rid of. I don't have access to the generator code, nor can I relocate the package to a different folder. Obviously I have a source folder pointing to src/main/java. I tried to exclude the com.blah.generated package, but then the com.blah.software using it fails to compile. I tried adding a second source folder pointing to the same folder, and excluding com.blah.software so that I can turn on "Ignore optional compile problems", but Eclipse complains (however there's no overlapping between the two folders): Build path contains duplicate entry: 'src/main/java' for project 'blah' I also tried filtering the Problems view to Include selected element and its children EXCEPT the com.blah.generated. but there's no such option.
The Overall Problem When I install a simple Java application that I wrote to run on boot in the background through /etc/init.d/, it works on the liveUSB that I explicitly install it on. When I make a copy of that stick, it never boot successfully. When booting the liveUSB copy the Java application will always hang when the liveUSB boot process reaches my script. My script, which does do exactly what it is supposed to do, even every 5 minutes and will continue running forever until you power down the machine. My script is blocking everything else Nothing loads beyond my script You cannot cancel my script There is no GUI The only text you can see is the command line output from my script Setup & Test - Everything goes well :) I have a Linux liveUSB with 3 partitions. Simple standard Xubuntu image is loaded. sda1 > 2gb stoage sda2 > 2gb system sda3 > remaining gb for casper I have created a simple Java application that runs in the background on start up. To get this far, I followed these steps: Compiled java application into classes Placed class files in /home/user/folder/ Copied my startup.sh script into /etc/init.d/ While inside /etc/init.d/ Typed "update-rc.d startup.sh start 20 2 5 . stop 20 0 1 6 ." This updated run levels successfully Now I can restart / reboot / shutdown whatever operation and everything runs perfectly! The Copy - Here's where it gets tricky! When creating a copy of this stick, I follow these steps: Mount sda2 copy everything from that folder to /home/user/Desktop/tmp-system/ Mount sda3 copy everything from that folder to /home/user/Desktop/tmp-casper/ Go into /home/user/Desktop/tmp-system/ Type "tar -cvf system.tar ." Go into /home/user/Desktop/tmp-casper/ Type "tar -cvf casper.tar ." Umount sda2 sda3 Plug in empty USB (sdb for example) Set up partitions (Same as the stick you are copying from) Untar into partitions tar -xvf system.tar ... into sdb2 tar -xvf casper.tar ... into sdb3 Testing - Here's where everything goes wrong! Plug in newly created liveUSB into a computer Boot from USB Everything starts to boot fine Java application that I wrote gets triggered Boot process hangs forever No cmd prompt available NO GUI available It is as if the thread is running (and it is! The output can be viewed every 5 minutes - which is exactly the way it should be) Solution Attempts & Gotchas 1 I can mount the copied liveUSB edit the startup.sh to not start my Java application and it will still not boot (just as I suspected?). 2 If I use "dd if=sda of=sdb" the copy of the liveUSB will work perfectly fine. However this is not an acceptable solution. If I were to copy a 16gb stick with dd to a 64gb stick, that would turn the 64gb stick into a 16gb. 3 Tested many variations of startup.sh and the Java application itself. All of which produce the same error. 4 The method I am using to copy works for every other form of application, file or anything else. 5 I would also like to try and avoid using any additional libraries or programs to help run the Java application.
Currently I'm looking at integrating some build processes into my source control (Git hooks specifically). I'm trying to write a pre-commit hook that checks for build errors in my Java project (a medium-large test development project) and fails to allow commits that contain errors in the build. This is turning out to be rather challenging. The approach here uses a command-line Eclipse tool to build and output warnings and errors. This does technically work, but it's slow and may cause problems with the Eclipse IDE (I've already had heap allocation errors). I've also looked at solutions using ant but these approaches don't seem to be a simple one-line solution, and may still be slow. My main question: what's the fastest (run-time compilation speed) way to build and validate a Java project, by command line? I'd like a solution that returns 0 with no errors and something else if errors are present, but I'm willing to look at other things.

I am working on a java application in eclipse Indigo. I was working and debugging the project with no problems but at one attempt, the jvm gave an error and the run window crashed. After that now when I run the debugger on that specific project, the main program loads after 10-15 seconds and when it does, it hangs and closes down the program upon any action. The program runs fine in "Run Mode". I check debugger for one other project in the workspace and it works fine for that, but is only giving problem for this one specific project. I have tried running Eclipse again, clean and build project again, remove extra breakpoints and try again but the problem exists. How can I solve this problem, it is really annoying me as I have to deliver the project and without debugging I cannot track the data coming in and out.
We have a backend Java application responsible to schedule batch-jobs. It connects to the Oracle database, obtains the list of applicable jobs for the current run and executes them. The job type could vary from calling a Stored Proc, to moving a file etc. We are testing upgrade of Oracle from 11.1.0.7 to 11.2.0.3. Surprisingly, all the Move jobs are failing (indicating file doesn't exist) post this upgrade. This is the issue I am facing. Unfortunately, this Java application is a packaged product and I don't yet have access to the complete source code. I decompiled the class files. Before the move occurs, the Java program checks for the existence of the files using "if(!sourceFile.exists())" This attempt fails, leading to reattempts by the job and finally fails. We have already verified the file and folder permissions etc. I also downloaded the latest ojdbc5.jar for 11.2.0.3 from Oracle's website. But no luck. This environment is on a Linux-Solaris server. My question: Do you think there is any version dependency on Java or anything else because of the Oracle upgrade? Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

For my masterthesis I'm writing an Eclipse plugin for visualizing variables while debugging. I put a lot of effort in creating custom 'crawlers' for a comfortable access to the IJavaObject, IJavaType and IJavaValue and more. The problem is, that I haven't seen any possibility to get the real underlying object in memory but just the IJavaObject wrappers. E.g. if I have a java.awt.Color I can get the IJavaObject and call methods with my crawler (so via the clumsy sendMessage of JDT). Therefore I am able to query for the single R, G and B values, built my own Color object and can directly show the color. But when it comes to an java.awt.Image I want to directly draw somewhere, for example, I can't do this. I have access to the IJavaObject and my crawler and can call some methods (btw only those that accept primitive types as parameters) and even query private fields, but I need the real Image object not just it's width, height or ImageObservers. So in short: Is there ANY possibility to access the real underlying object of a IJavaObject? Thanks in advance.

I'm trying to make an servlets application with java and oracle10g and I've had it well so far until I need some specific values from some the database, for wich I have a DAO class that handles the connection for retrieving data. I have the following issue. First off, I excecute a main() method in this class that is suposed to retrieve all entries in some table an print the name of each one in console. I works perfectly. then I want to return an ArrayList of all those names in order to use them in the servlet. So I make a method just like the one in the main() with the only difference that instead of printing the names, I add each one to an ArrayList which is returned after closing the conection. Well, It gets ClassNotFoundException in the line Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver") If it helps, I'm guided with this tutorial to connect java applications to oracle databases. Any help would be appreciated
I'm trying to run FEST Swing tests on Jenkins as a service on Windows 7. I have already allowed the service to interect with the desktop with the necessary permission to do so. It was no use, though. Most of what I found on the internet either shows how to do it on Linux (through the CLI shell) or how to run it on the prompt, which is not what I'm looking for. I have also found some vague discussions on how to run the tests letting the desktop available (which was by running it on a VM). But that's not what I need either. I need to run the GUI tests just as they are run on Eclipse, with the graphical appearance on the desktop. When I try to do it, the following happens: execguitest: [echo] ---------------------------------------------- [echo] project-name: Executing project's GUI tests [echo] ---------------------------------------------- [junit] Running dev.AllGUITests [junit] null [junit] null [junit] null [junit] Tests run:33, Failures: 3, Errors: 30, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 112,375 sec [junit Test dev.AllGUITests FAILED Does anyone have a clue on how can it be done? P.S.: Sorry for any english mistakes. English is not my mother language.
The problem: I'm doing maintenance/enhancement work on a project using an old (2.0.3) version of Mojarra, and recently hit a bug. Updating Mojarra corrects the problem. Unfortunately, updating Mojarra on the production Glassfish server isn't an option; a whole bunch of applications in production are on that server, and there is no possible way our QA department would be able to check all of them for regression errors. The proposed solution: Deploy Mojarra with just this application, I've dropped the new Mojarra jar (javax.faces-2.1.26.jar) into /WEB-INF/lib, and changed the sun-web.xml per BalusC's answer in another question. The complication: Doesn't work. Setting <class-loader delegate="false" /> results in a null-pointer exception when I log into the app; apparently, my EJBs are no longer being set properly. Leaving "delegate" set to "true" gets me into the app, but is using the old Mojarra on the server, leaving me back where I started. So, how do I accomplish what I want here? Is there some other way of doing this (other than updating the JAR on the Glassfish server itself, which is a non-starter) or of correcting the behavior I'm seeing? EDIT: Taking a closer look at the console output, I'm getting a TON of ClassNotFoundExceptions. It looks like my other JAR files aren't getting pulled-in.
Its absolutely clear for me, that usually a Java program should not catch Throwable, since it is catching Error-s like OutOfMemoryError. 100% clear. But. If I have a multi-threaded application, it is usually a best practice, that I should have an UncaughtExceptionHandler, which does something if RuntimeException or Error happens. What I usually want to do, is simply logging. Logging RuntimeExceptions cannot really hurt, thats clear. But the question arises in me: Which errors can I catch and log safely in an UncaughtExceptionHandler, which will not treat my whole application if I log it? Which errors are there, which does not mean, that the application must stop immediately? For example if I get an OutOfMemoryError, I would just ask for a printStackTrace to standard out, since the memory need of logging it can kill other threads. But a StackOverflowError seems to me totally safe to be logged, since it means simply, that the stack area of the current thread became full. It is safe to log it. Which other Error descendants would you log?
I wrote an Eclipse plugin that presents a right click menu option on any file or folder (for example, in navigator view). For each file selected (and for each file inside of a selected directory), the plugin computes and displays the MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 hash of the file. The plugin works perfectly when I debug while developing. If I make the site using site.xml, put it on my server, and then install to Eclipse (it installs just fine), I see the menu. I can compute and display the hash for a selected file, but it just won't work for a selected folder. Absolutely nothing has changed in the code; it always works in debug mode, and it never works when I install it. My question is this: how can I debug this? At first, I thought Eclipse's workspace/.metadata/.log file would offer some clue, but no error is output. I even went so far as to try adding some code in that writes a file to the desktop, but that file never gets created. Does anyone have any clue what is going on or how I should go about fixing this? I've never had such a hard time debugging before! For reference, https://github.com/gfairchild/eclipse-hasher is the project. All source code is viewable there (it can be imported as an Eclipse project). The answer ultimately involved 2 things: I wasn't including the lib directory during the build process. The dependency I use (Apache Commons Codec) wasn't included, so of course it wouldn't run. During the testing process, I had tried manually putting a build of Hasher into eclipse/plugins. I incorrectly assumed that if I uninstalled Hasher through the Eclipse interface, this file would be removed. It wasn't. So for the last month, I've had a stale version of Hasher being loaded into Eclipse. That's incredibly frustrating. Oh, well. Lesson learned. Thanks very much to everyone that offered help!
I have an OSGi environment running some bundles, one of them uses Service Bus API (Azure Java SDK v 0.4.4) and there are some errors after I reload my OSGi environment. The workflow is this: Initialize the JVM and the OSGi framework Bundles are loaded and started Service Bus bundle creates a Configuration using "ServiceBusConfiguration.configureWithWrapAuthentication(v,w,x,y,z)" call and everything runs smoothly I programmatically restart the OSGi framework and then all bundles are loaded and started again Service Bus bundle tries to create a Configuration using "ServiceBusConfiguration.configureWithWrapAuthentication(v,w,x,y,z)" but this time I get the following error: Exception in thread "Thread-7" java.util.ServiceConfigurationError: com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.core.Builder$Exports: Provider com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.blob.Exports not a subtype at java.util.ServiceLoader.fail(ServiceLoader.java:231) at java.util.ServiceLoader.access$300(ServiceLoader.java:181) at java.util.ServiceLoader$LazyIterator.next(ServiceLoader.java:369) at java.util.ServiceLoader$1.next(ServiceLoader.java:445) at com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.core.DefaultBuilder.create(DefaultBuilder.java:43) at com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.core.Configuration.<init>(Configuration.java:52) at com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.core.Configuration.load(Configuration.java:78) at com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.core.Configuration.getInstance(Configuration.java:63) at com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.serviceBus.ServiceBusConfiguration.configureWithWrapAuthentication(ServiceBusConfiguration.java:88) After some debugging I see that it could be an issue with the ServiceLoader, more exactly when it checks if the com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.blob.Exports is a subclass or implements com.microsoft.windowsazure.services.core.Builder$Exports which is also being checked after during the first run. So in my opinion there must be something that prevents the proper reload of the Services but I've not been able to figure out what's exactly happening. Hope any of you has a clue about that!
I have very perplexing issue that I'm encountering at the moment with Websphere 7.0.0.27 and a particular web service call using the org.springframework.remoting.jaxws.JaxWsPortProxyFactoryBean class (from spring-web either 3.2.3.RELEASE or 3.1.1.RELEASE). The service call is functioning perfectly fine when I start my server from scratch. I can call the service, get data back, and my app functions just fine. However, when I re-publish my application, subsequent calls result in the following: javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException: ServiceDescription.updateEndpointDescription: Cant do a getPort() specifiying a different SEI than the previous getPort(). PortQN: {0}; current SEI: {1}; previous SEI: {2} at org.apache.axis2.jaxws.ExceptionFactory.createWebServiceException(ExceptionFactory.java:173) at org.apache.axis2.jaxws.ExceptionFactory.makeWebServiceException(ExceptionFactory.java:70) at org.apache.axis2.jaxws.ExceptionFactory.makeWebServiceException(ExceptionFactory.java:118) at org.apache.axis2.jaxws.description.impl.ServiceDescriptionImpl.updateEndpointDescription(ServiceDescriptionImpl.java:557) at org.apache.axis2.jaxws.description.impl.DescriptionFactoryImpl.updateEndpoint(DescriptionFactoryImpl.java:372) at org.apache.axis2.jaxws.description.DescriptionFactory.updateEndpoint(DescriptionFactory.java:178) at org.apache.axis2.jaxws.spi.ServiceDelegate.getPort(ServiceDelegate.java:584) at org.apache.axis2.jaxws.spi.ServiceDelegate.getPort(ServiceDelegate.java:507) at javax.xml.ws.Service.getPort(Service.java:103) at org.springframework.remoting.jaxws.JaxWsPortClientInterceptor.getPortStub(JaxWsPortClientInterceptor.java:419) at org.springframework.remoting.jaxws.JaxWsPortClientInterceptor.prepare(JaxWsPortClientInterceptor.java:337) at org.springframework.remoting.jaxws.JaxWsPortClientInterceptor.invoke(JaxWsPortClientInterceptor.java:484) at org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:172) at org.springframework.aop.framework.JdkDynamicAopProxy.invoke(JdkDynamicAopProxy.java:204) at $Proxy109.search(Unknown Source) at ... It happens to the service call only after an app publish. I can call the service over and over without issue, then publish, and then I start getting this issue. After I restart Websphere, the problem is gone until I publish again. Also important is that this seems to only occur when I run the sever setting "Run server with resources within the workspace". The option "Run server with resources on Server" doesn't have this happen, but I don't want to use that setting because I need to do an entire publish (as opposed to simply a file save) to get my JSP changes to show up, and that's a bigger waste of time. Also, I'm using Eclipse (4.2) and this also happens in RAD (7.5). Has anyone else encountered this issue before, and were you able to resolve it? I'll try to provide any further detail as I come across it.
I'm using resteasy-links (2.3.7.Final) to enhance my resources with HATEOAS links. When using a constraint for the @LinkResource to restrict its creation based on a property the BeanELResolver fails with a PropertyNotFoundException when the Type is passed in. The problem is that the RESTUtils of resteasy-links either pass in the entity or in the case of an ResourceFacade the type of the entity. Since the class of the entity obviously does not have the same properties as the entity itself this is bound to fail. What I want to do is to only show the link if the entity has no endTime, which works perfectly well for the direct use case, but as soon as a ResourceFacade is used only the Type of the entity (DTO.class) is passed into the ELContext. @LinkResource(value = DTO.class, constraint = "${endTime == null}") I tried "${!(this instanceof java.lang.Class) && endTime == null}" "${this.getClass() == 'DTO' && endTime == null}" "${!this.toString().contains('class') && endTime == null}" but the 1. did not even compile and the second failed since Class does not have a getClass(). 3. works but seems rather hacky to me. https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/2.3.7.Final/userguide/html/LinkHeader.html#8.2.8.%20Resource%20facades Any better ideas?
I have a jnlp file for the topcoder arena that I have downloaded from topcoder. I have created a new user and copied some(C:\Users\User*) files from old user on a Windows 7 machine. In the old user this applet used to work fine. But in the new user now it's not. It stops while downloading the application or while verifying the application. It seems that I might have not copied some cache files or might have missed some config. files from old user. I have also tried eclipse plugin for the contest applet. But it's also having the same problem. I have also tried to download the application using the same jnlp on entirely new laptop and jnlp is working fine on other laptop as well. I have freshly installed jre. Also tested two other jnlp applications from Sun website. All other are working fine. But only this one is not working. I have even enabled the logs using javaws. But it's really not very useful. My ask for help: Can someone please tell me how do I debug this jnlp file which can direct me in the resolution of this problem? I missed couple of competitions. :( Thanks.
The context is this: I have class with all static methods and a static initialize block. This class is part of a web application, which is packed as a war and deployed inside WebSphere 10. There are situations where other classes in the war try to call methods on this class, only to get a NoClassDefFoundError. What I find strange is that, I can see from the logs that the class's methods and such have already been called multiple times, successfully, but all of a sudden, an identical (previously successful) method call will presently generate a NoClassDefFoundError. At this point any future such calls to the class's static methods will generate that error (until the WebSpehere container is restarted or the war is redeployed). What puzzles me is why the class seems to work for a while before throwing the NoClassDefFoundError. The documentation on this exception says: The searched-for class definition existed when the currently executing class was compiled, but the definition can no longer be found. So my question is,how come a class is usable for a while, clearly responding to calls to its static methods and then throw NoClassDefFoundError?
I am writing an Android app that allows recorded files to be played back while performing some signal processing on the data. A file is selected from a listview, this launches a new activity where playback and processing occurs. In the onBackPressed method I call finish to end the activity and return to the list view, where the user can select another file. All works well when selecting a small file several times or a large file once, however when a large file is selected again an OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown. I have used the DDMS to see my memory heap and it is clear that the memory from the activity is not released when returning to the list view. It accumulates based on the size of the file being loaded. Despite extensive research I cant work out where the memory leak is coming from. I have looked into Bitmap and Context references as the causes, however these seem do not to be the issue. File loading itself does also not appear to be the issue as I have another similar activity that uses real-time audio acquired from the mic. 1) What could be the cause of the memory leak? 2) How do I ensure that an activity's memory is freed when finish/ondestroy is called.
I'm working on a Java project and I've come upon an interesting design issue. It's not exactly a problem, but it is a bit ugly with the obvious solution. I have a class implementing Callable, although with the current implementation it could just as easily be a Runnable as I'm not interested in the outcome, at least not as far as the calling thread is concerned. The calling thread will drop a number of these into a thread pool. Each of these Callables will have a batch of data that was obtained from an external service. The Callables will perform a number of actions, many of which involve making further calls to external services. As a result, there are a good number of places where various Exceptions could be thrown. The issue I find is that depending on where the Exception occurs, I may need to take different actions. If it happens at point A, then delete the data on the external service. If it happens at point B, move the data to a different location on the server. If it happens at point C, just log it and do nothing further, etc. Any number of Exception types could be thrown at multiple points, although I don't think I'll need to do much filtering on the type itself, but more that one occurred. The Callable itself isn't terribly huge, so there's not a great deal of code to mess with. However, I am hesitant to kludge it up with a ton of try/catch blocks to handle every possible point/Exception that may need different handling. I realize that this may really be the only viable solution. I don't really have control over most of the Exceptions that will be thrown (maybe a handful) without catching an existing one and rethrowing my own, which seems a bit redundant. I'm wondering if there's a good pattern or method to handle this sort of thing. I've considered an exception handling class, but I'd still need to catch each Exception somehow and pass it to the handler as the point at which the Exception was thrown is important. I could break the Callable down into more atomic classes, each with their own small block and handling, but that would be trading one kludge for another. Catching everything in the call() method outright or by grabbing the Exception from the Future in the calling thread really isn't an option as this will lose the data on where it occurred unless I want to parse the stack trace, which isn't exactly viable. Can anyone shed some light? Maybe I'm just quibbling over the try/catch blocks and should just go ahead with it, but I feel like there must be a better way... Hmmm, it does occur to me that annotations on methods might help here. I could break down all methods until there's only one possible exception-throwing piece of code in each. Annotate each of these with a custom annotation that dictates what is done when that method throws an exception. I'm not sure if it is possible (an exception would somehow need to be caught right there as it may happen within a loop going over each piece of data and only one piece may be problematic, or at least somehow mark that piece for processing further up the chain), but perhaps this could mitigate the need for lots of try/catch blocks and instead handle the behavior with a single annotation and a handler class to deal with the exceptions. I don't believe it's possible to dictate behavior this way with an annotation, but I'd be happy to be wrong on that.
i'm using eclipse kepler 4.3, I've installed the android sdk plugin, and installed everything required with the sdk manager, and I've also installed the Google Web Toolkit plugin as required. I'm on ubuntu (linux) using openjdk-6. I've created my projects with the libgdx ui project creator thing, and I used nightly build with both of the third party programs. I imported them into eclipse fixed the android and html 5 errors, but I still have one error on my desktop project. The constructor LwjglApplication(Main, LwjglApplicationConfiguration) is undefined on line 14 of this class : http://pastie.org/8398405 I've tried googling, and stack overflow, but the only thing I found was the same error with the solution : "I installed GWT and it fixed the previous 2 errors", however i've already installed gwt, unless i'm being a derp and there are further setup instructions passed going to the install software thing, typing in the link installing it, and restarting. I would really appreciate any help, thanks guys :)
The type of an exception is often enough to handle it properly (for example you try to open a file and get a FileNotFoundException). However there are cases where you might catch multiple exception of the same type. For example, an IllegalArgumentException that can be caused by more than one argument. The IllegalArgumentException does not add any additional methods (or public fields) to the Throwable interface (accoding to the online javadoc) which means that the only information that you can rely on are the nested exception (which may or may not exist) and the message (which is for human consumption). I don't like the idea of extending IllegalArgumentException to add structured information to it, because other people would have to learn the new class. And I don't like the idea of littering projects with very specific exception classes. Using the message field is also a bad idea because it's not meant for programmatic access. I think IllegalArgumentException should have included details such as the class function and argument(s) in question. And in general custom exceptions should provide additional detail (other then just their type) for a more fine grained exception handling. What are considered generally the best practices for designing exception classes, and handling exceptions of the same type?
I would highly appreciate your help with a ClassNotFoundError while calling a Java method from RPG. This happens when any other user, except me, tries to run my program. It literally seems a problem with CLASSPATH or access to jar files but I tried from that aspect too. Explanation: I have an RPG program which calls a java method in a jar file. My CLASSPATH has the right jars included (JtOpen jar files). It works perfectly when I run the RPG program from a Green and Black screen (Iseries session manager). Where as it throws the following error message whenever another user tries to run it the same way: RPG Procedure received Java Exception java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.ibm.as400.access.AS400 when calling method "invokeApiPgm" with signature "([Ljava.lang.String;Ljava.lang.String;I[Ljava.lang.String;)Z" in class "callIceApi.CallIceApiPgm". The signature above is also the same as that of the method i call. Does the class the Java is complaining seem to be that of AS400 or could it be mine? I can see that the AS400 class is available as public. The class object was created successfully by the constructor of my class. It just fails when calling the main method invokeApiPgm. What do you think I am missing or messing up with, guys? Thanks for your help! Tewelle
Netty Version: 4.0.10.Final I've written a client and server using Netty. Here is what client and server do. Server: Wait for connection from client Receive messages from client If a message is bad, write error message (6 bytes), flush it, close the socket and do not read any unread messages in the socket. Otherwise continue reading messages. Do nothing with good messages. Client: Connect to server. After writing N good messages, write one bad message and continue writing M good messages. This process happens in a separate thread. This thread is started after the channel is active. If there is any response from server, log it and close the socket. (Note that server responds only when there is an error) I've straced both client and server. I've found that server is closing connection after writing the error message. Client began seeing broken pipe errors when writing good messages after the bad message. This is because server detected bad message and responded with error message and closed socket. connection is closed only after the write operation is complete using a listener. Client is not reading error message from server always. Earlier step (2) in client is performed in I/O thread. This caused the % of error messages received over K number of experiments to be really low (<10%). After moving step (2) to separate thread, % went to (70%). In any case it is not accurate. Does netty trigger channel read if the write fails due to broken pipe? Update 1: I'm clarifying and answering any questions asked here, so everybody can find the asked questions/clarifications at one place. "You're writing a bad message that will cause a reset, followed by good messages that you already know won't get through, and trying to read a response that may have been thrown away. It doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever" - from EJP -- In real world the server could treat something as bad for whatever reason client can't know in advance. For simplification, I said client intentionally sends a bad message that causes reset from server. I would like to send all good messages even if there are bad messages in the total messages. What I'm doing is similar to the protocol implemented by Apple Push Notification Service.
I have the following exception when I launch my script in the development environment (SunOS 5.10 i86pc Solaris), I tried searching on google for hours trying various workarounds suggested but do not solve the problem. In fact, trying to use super-user when I launch my script the report is generated, whereas with a normal user I get the following exception and the report is not generated.

The most recent version of the JRE plugin , JRE version 1.7.0_45-b18, when installed will cause the appearance of a Pop-up warning every time you download an applet. We do sign our jars but in a development environment, but we do this using a generic certificate which makes us look like an Unknown publisher. Yes you can register your domain by purchasing a certificate but this is not practical in a development environment. In future releases of java, you will not even be able to click through the warning. The applet simply will not load, according to oracle. http://www.java.com/en/download/help/appsecuritydialogs.xml As a developer, its not clear what to do in my development environments to be able to test and demonstrate my applets without being hindered by these security restrictions. Any one have a solution?
I'm facing a design issue in which I would like to have only one JMS producer sending messages to two consumers. There are only two servers, and the producer will start generating messages that will be load balanced (with round robin) to both consumers. In the hypothetical case of one server failing, I do have a mechanism so a new producer will be activated in the remaining server. But what will happen to the messages that were being processed in the server that went down? Will they be reassigned to the remaining server thus being processed by the remaining consumer? or they will be lost? If the last case is true there will be another problem. The producer creates messages based on files in a NAS so when a server goes down, the newly activated producer will start creating messages based on the contents of the NAS and that may replicate messages (but that case is handled) the problem is that if the server that goes down is not the server with the active producer then when the server goes up again it will not have messages to consume and also no messages will replace the ones lost. How can I achieve a design so that no messages are lost? Note: When one server goes down, the journal and bindings are lost.
I am using the Spring MVC Test framework in Spring 3.2.4, and one problem I have with it is that it continuously traps exceptions. For example, if you perform a POST with JSON data (or anything really), and a NullPointerException or Jackson MappingException is thrown, it doesn't just report it in the console output like a regular test - it traps it and does something else with it - or sometimes suppresses it altogether and forces me to create temporary @ExceptionHandler methods in my controllers or manually invoke andDo(print()) just to see what went wrong. How can I get spring-mvc-test framework to just report errors like any other test? I use IntelliJ IDEA, and I just want to see the exception stack track and have full clickability with respect to line numbers and such offered by the IDE. Without this most basic testing feature, creating and debugging tests with Spring MVC test framework is actually really a pain. I really appreciate the help.
So here's where I'm at: I've installed the Apache Tomcat Server successfully. I've configured the JAVA_HOME path successfully, and created a /common/lib directory (as opposed to plain /lib) to get around an issue with NetBeans recognising recent versions of Tomcat. If I select GlassFish 4.0 as my server, instead of Tomcat, everything's fine -- but I don't want GlassFish 4.0 as my server, as I'm working through a book on Java WebApps and don't want to run into intractable problems further down the line. When I select Tomcat as my server, I run into the problem that the dropdown menu to select my "Java EE Version" decides it doesn't want to give me any options at all. Has anyone experienced this problem before, or can anyone offer a rough guess as to what my problem might be? Thanks in advance! EDIT: Update - it's not a problem with the JDK classpath of Tomcat. Tomcat works fine on the .jsp files it came bundled with.
I've recently had my app moved from Websphere Application Server 6.1 to WAS 7.5, due to end-of-life for 6.1. Consequently, I needed to update my debugging server. I found this to be an opportune time to move my application from an IBM RAD IDE to Eclipse (already had Indigo installed). Or so I thought. Anyway, the powers that be, here, have recommended taking my debugger all the way to WAS 8.5, since I'm only using it to debug. But the issue that I'm encountering is that I cannot get the debugger to stop on my breakpoints. I've got approx. 10 breakpoints in my opening page, all in JSP/Java code. I'm running Java 1.6.0_32 and Java SE Runtime Environment build 1.6.0_32-b05. I really don't know how to check which JDK I've got loaded. I've seen recommendations to "go back" to JDK 1.5, but I can't be certain that's not what I'm running. And to cover a few other bases, I have JUST started my system for the day, opened the IDE, started the server in debug (says "Debugging, Synchronized"), put focus on the opening page of the application and clicked "Debug on server". The front page opens without stopping at any of the breakpoints. Does anyone have ideas or suggestions?
I am attempting to run "cordova build android" through phonegap CLI with Terminal on my Mac. First I downloaded the Android SDK. Then I set up the project and added android. Then I attempted "cordova build android" and received the following error: Error: An error occurred while building the android project. Please install Android target 17 (the Android newest SDK). Make sure you have the latest Android tools installed as well. Run "android" from your command-line to install/update any missing SDKs or tools. So I ran "android" and installed everything related to target 17.

When i try to debug a simple application in Eclipse i receive a following error: Cannot connect to VM com.sun.jdi.connect.TransportTimeoutException And console provides me with a lonely string: FATAL ERROR in native method: JDWP No transports initialized, jvmtiError=AGENT_ERROR_TRANSPORT_INIT(197) I have JRE 1.6, JRE 1.7 and JDK 1.7 installed. Tried all of them. I've seen tons of same topics, but not a single answer helped me to solve my issue. Here they are: 1) Disable Firewall. Doesn't help. I have latest Avast ver. 9.0 at the moment. I'm a bit suspicious about that software, because before updating my Avast i was able to debug in Eclipse. I think it may cause this error, but i do not have direct clues :). I may ping my machine, firewall doesn't block Eclipse traffic, etc. 2) Add strings to hosts file. No reaction. ::1 localhost.localdomain localhost 127.0.0.1 localhost 3) Changing Network Settings in Java Control Panel to "Direct" connection. Doubtful advice. Also read that thing: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Debug/FAQ Can anyone help me to find out what is happening? Or guide me in the right direction?
I'm trying to write something in Java that receives an XML string and validates it against an XSD schema, and does automatic error handling for some simple common errors, and outputs a fixed XML string. I've come across the SAX ErrorHandler interface for the Validator.validate() function, but that seems to be mostly for reporting exceptions and I can't figure out how to modify the XML from it, other than getting the line/column number which would be very tedious to fix problems. I also found the Validator.validate() function which has a source and a result, and returns augmented XML, which to my knowledge just fills in missing attributes that have default values, which is part of what I need to do. But I also need something along the lines of fixing a missing start or end tag, and correcting a tag that has been misspelled by a letter, and things like that. There are so many "Handler" interfaces (ValidationHandler, ContentHandler, EntityResolver) that I'm not sure which ones to look at in depth, so if someone could point me in the right direction that would be great (I don't need a detailed code example). Also I'm not sure how the XMLReader fits in to it all.
All, I have had this now a couple of times..I create a new Java Enterprise Web Application on Netbeans, add Primefaces 4, Spring on glassfish running MySql I have some reference tool classes in my ejb project and I added classes through the Finder/Explorer on Mac. Clean & build works all fine but when I want to deploy I get the error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Lorg/utils/sql/SqlUtils; This is a class I import correctly everywhere as org/utils/sql/SqlUtils but for some reason it adds a "L" in front and then obviously cant find it. I had found previously that removing the class and disabling imports that it simply complains about any other file. In a previous project I had some automatically created entity classes and the error occurred when I deleted them, even though they had nothing todo with the import related error. When I put the entity classes back then also the error disappeared. If anybody could help that would be greatly appreciated.
I am using sqlcipher.jar for encrypting database in android and also using it's native library in libs/armeabi folder 1)libdatabase_sqlcipher.so 2)libsqlcipher_android.so 3)libstlport_shared.so and libs/x86 folder 1)libdatabase_sqlcipher.so 2)libsqlcipher_android.so 3)libstlport_shared.so and jar file named sqlcipher.jar in libs/ folder all i have imported now every thing is working fine it's going good database is fetching and reading from sqlite is also working fine and also i am not getting any kind of error in SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(context); line but i want to implement also OCR in my project to do that i am importing project named tess-two from this http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ and https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two in that there is a library named tess-two folder and i am importing that project library into my android project and i cleaned my project and run it at that time i got the error in line SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(context); again when i removed tess-two library and doing uninstall from device and doing clean and build and run it's working fine no error is occurring, i want OCR functionality also in my project can anybody help me
I have too many(100s of) Hi-resolution(1200x800) JPEGS on the SD Card created. What I am doing right now is Load them all in Thread and Keep them in ArrayList . I Play Them on Image View Frame By Frame at specific Frame Rate selected by user on UI. My Intention here for loading all the images because I want to play them very fast around 55 fps. Thats works fine if I have 1 Set of 100 image and Tablet with RAM = 1 GB but I have Two Image Viewer both with their own Set of (100 JPEGS) it goes out of memory. I Tried many ways for my solutions . Here is what I have tried so far. 1 ) FFMPEG video encoding of JPEGS on SDCard ( it will not work as User will be seeking to any position of 100 image and it should be view on screen immediately also I am applying filters like brightness contrast on image so FFMPEG will not work in that) 2) Loading Single file as Bitmap as They are played ( its not working as I want to achieve High Frame Rate and Files Take Time to load ) 3) Third Approach which I am using right now works good for me right now but ( Out of Memory Problem as I Have Two Image View with their image set (each one 100 images)) which is loading all Images in ArrayList and user Can Seek to any Image with Seekbar fast as possible and Can Apply various filter on bitmap. I expect some expert solution for loading fast images on specific frame rate.
I am using a Java API (JWPL) to process wikipedia dump, after I run some application, I got the error of OutOfMemory: Java heap space. Since I can't check the source code, what I can do is to increase the maximum assignment of heap size. Is there anything else I can do? Another question is: the goal to run this application is to get some output textfiles, I already know the names of all the files, 11 in total. From last run, I got 7 files already, but it stopped with the above mentioned error. Now after I change the maximum heap size, I am wondering if there is a way that I can make the next run start from the point where it lefts over, because the duration of a complete run is like 8 hours. I simply don't want it start from very beginning, I just want to get the rest 4 files. I am quite new to Java, please give me some suggestions. Thanks in advance!

I'm trying to get Google Cloud SQL working with AppEngine using Java. I followed the example here https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/cloud-sql/?csw=1#using_the_java_development_server but there seem to be errors (or at least omissions) in the code. The line Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url); shows an error because there is no such class as com.google.cloud.sql.jdbc.DriverManager, and the connection created by com.google.cloud.sql.jdbc.Connection is of a different type than the one needed by java.sql.DriverManager. The example does not show what imports they used, and I can't find a set of imports that work properly. I actually did get the example to work deployed in Google AppEngine, but can't get it to also work locally, and the deployed version is VERY SLOW, perhaps because I got it to work by using the java.sql classes rather than the com.google.cloud.sql classes (since there doesn't appear to be a complete set of the latter). I know this can't be too complicated, but I have been unable to figure it out for 2 full days. If you know how to get this to work or what silly thing I am missing, please let me know.
The error message generally produced by JNLP clients, not least Sun's/Oracle's own Java Web Start client, are generally oriented towards end-users and not very helpful for figuring out the root cause for why they appear. For instance, when I try to run my JNLP program right now with Oracle's JNLP client, it simply says to me that "The Java security settings have prevented this application from running. You may change this behavior in the Java Control Panel." NetX hasn't been much more helpful either, but it also seems to implement much less of the security model than Oracle's client does, so it would only help so far even if it were. Is there any good way to find out what security problems it is that I'm actually having? "Read the documentation" is of course the easy answer, but the security model seems rather complex and incorporates many parts. Is there some kind of "lint" tool for JNLP out there that can list the problems I'm having? Or is there some way to run the JNLP client in some kind of debug mode? I'm not really asking for help with this particular, specific problem. I've been having other problems previously, too, and have mostly only gotten past them by mere guess-work and getting lucky, and I'm still not sure I've solved them correctly.
Could you please advise, I'm working on integration tests using Gebish(Selenium) library. I have several steps in my tests and two scenarios. Before each scenario I create 'browser' object, and after each I call 'browser.quit()'. I actively use waitFor constructions, so that I give some time for updates from mouse actions become available. The problem is that sometimes without any obvious reasons tests fail, usually just only one of the last steps fails. Other previous are passed. But if this fail happens I see very strange situation: at the beginning I see the first new FF window for the first scenario, but it is empty, after that I see next FF window for another scenario, it is empty too. So as a result - I got one failed test cases and a lot of passed and I have two instances of FF with blank pages which were not closed automatically. I'm very confused. I tried to use different timeouts in waitFor constructions, I tried ChromeDriver instead of FFdriver, and I still have the same problem with the same scenario.
I'm currently working on a project where I'm using TestNG to kick off Selenium test suites and handle all my logging of my results in a maven project which are being run nightly on a Jenkins job. Currently when a test fails an assertion, TestNG kills everything we are running, it doesn't just fail the current test and continue running the other tests in the suite. I don't understand why TestNG doesn't just fail the current test and then kick off the remaining tests that have yet to be run. This makes TestNG at this point a useless tool. There has to be a way to configure TestNG somewhere to continue running tests after a single test fails. And yes I have been looking for answers and I haven't found one to solve this problem yet. I'm starting to think I need to look at a different tool to handle my test execution and results if I can't get TestNG to work properly.
Software: Eclipse, keytool from java SDK Language: Java Platform: Android Searched already: Google and StackOverFLow, all related finds are about finding or restoring debug keystores, this probleem seems non existing, probably due to a rookie mistake on my part :( The problem I have the following problem, I have created a game and attached for testing the debug APK SHA1 to Google Play Services so I could test achievements etc. I released the game and that debug SHA1 is still connected, at the time I thought it to be wise so I could keep on testing for future version releases. Now comes the issue. I am trying to add Google Play Services to an older game I made in the past. Now I can't add the SHA1 code from that debug keystore because it already used by my other application, since I can't seem to delete that debug entry from GooglePlay Services I am stuck with using a different SHA1 code, which means a different debug key(store). However I can't seem to create a different debug store due to the rules that are needed for android SDK, I cannot change the alias, passwords for the debug key... all results in a bad keystore. How can I change the SHA1 for the debug key which will work with eclipse and android so that I can add the new debug SHA1 to Google Play Services so I can start testing?
I'm using spring's NamedParameterJdbcTemplate batchUpdate to insert a batch to an Oracle 11g database. I build up my parameter array, and pass it along with my sql to the batchUpdate method like so: namedParameterJdbcTemplate.batchUpdate(UPDATE_SQL, parameterArray); This works great. However, if there is even a single bad record in the batch, the whole batch update fails. Is this behaviour configurable? I would like the valid records to insert, and the invalid records to be handled by catching an exception. Colloquially, I had heard that if this was supported by your db, you should be able to do it, but I can't see any flags to turn it on. This may have been misinformation. I've tried setting auto commit to true, but I think this didn't work because it would be committing the batch. I tried to catch the SQLException, and then do a manual commit on the connection, but I haven't got that working yet. So really I'm trying to find out if what I'm trying to do is even possible? A batch update where one bad record doesn't roll-back the rest of the batch?
If you declare a private field in a test class: private Foo foo; That gets used but is never assigned, IntelliJ IDEA (and presumably other IDEs) show a warning when I hover over the declaration, and it renders it gray private field 'foo' is never assigned But if I'm using Mockito and annotate the field like: @Mock private Foo foo; The warning disappears and renders the field in purple to indicate that it is assigned. How does the IDE know what @Mock implies? I've had a look through the Mockito source code and there doesn't seem to be anything on the annotation definition and my IDE doesn't have a Mockito plugin. I'm writing a library similar to Mockito with an equivilant annotation and I'd love to know to get the IDE to remove the warning. (I'm not a Java developer, so if I've said anything wrong please correct me) EDIT I've tried this in Eclipse and it actually removes the warning with any annotation, which is what @nikpon was suggesting.

I'm working on some code for a class project. We're given a .jar file with some classes we need to use. In using those classes, I encountered quite an error. One of the classes, a directional graph, has a method for adding an edge between two nodes in a graph. That method throws a VertexNotFoundException, defined in one of the .class files in the jar we were given. Whenever I try to use that method, I get the error listed in the title: The type VertexNotFoundException could not be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files. I added the jar to my project by going through Build Path->Configure Build Path->Libraries->Add External Jar and selecting this jar. The directed graph class, also found in the jar, works fine, yet VertexNotFoundException does not. Note that I do not directly reference VertexNotFoundException in my code, but I use code which references it. A little bit (the first two pages) of googling revealed that this error message likes to pop up when people don't include certain Apache jars in their Apache project, yet I am not using Apache for this project and have no need to do any server things at all. I also found that this error likes to happen with some classes from the Java runtime itself, but that was supposedly fixed in Eclipse 3.4.

I'm writing a multiplayer game in Scala where the floating-point computations have to happen in exactly the same way on every computer, so I tried adding the @strictfp annotation to every class, object, and trait. However, when I try to run the code I get errors like this one: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Method handleKeyPress in class com/nathanstoddard/common/renderer2d/InputHandler has illegal modifiers: 0xC01. If I remove the @strictfp annotation from that class, it gives a similar error message for a different method in a different class. What does this error message mean, and how do I fix it? Is it a bug in my code or in the Scala compiler? I've tried using the @strictfp tag in smaller applications, and so far I've been unable to reproduce this crash with anything but my large project. Also, is there a way to enable strictfp globally, so I don't have to add it to every class? I'm using Scala 2.10.3 on Windows 7, and Java 1.7.0_10 (64-bit), and I'm running my program with sbt 0.12.2.
I have a simple Spring Integration 2.0.1 aggregator setup, using a SimpleMessageStore along with a regular Spring MessageGroupStoreReaper defined, in order to be able to implement a grouping timeout mechanism (which worked simply as an aggregator 'timeout' parameter in Spring Integration 1.0.4). I already debugged and verified the messages are aggregated correctly within SimpleMessageStore based on groupId, but upon timeout the MessageGroupStoreReaper fails, with "Unable to access property 'messages' through getter" AccessException. The precise error is located within MessagingMethodInvokerHelper class, which asserts the messages field is not null. It seems somehow the messages aggregated are not available during execution of the Invoker, resulting in the ""Invalid method parameter for messages: was expecting a single payload." IllegalStateException. What could be the cause of this issue and how to resolve it? I already tried updating to 2.0.6, but the issue remains. ***EDIT I updated my SI dependencies to 2.2.5, but this did not resolve my problem. I use Spring 3.0.7.
I had an XML-config that had an error in it (it referred to a missing constructor with no/empty parameters), once the constructor was created, and thus this error fixed, the error was still marked in the XML-file. I moved the line causing the error, but the error now moved on to the next line, but text at the marked line still referring to the original faulty bean-definition. Being a Maven-project I tried to do all the maven update-commands, I rebuilt, restarted the IDE, restarted the PC but the error persisted. As a final attempt to get rid of this error I removed almost all entries in the XML-file, apart from the usual xmlns-entries in the beginning. The error was now gone. I then added the beans, one by one, and the error never showed up - as expected since the error was fixed. This leads me to think: is there an "error cache" or something that one can cleanup or somehow refresh? Are there an easier way to clean up such "old" errors?
I'm into a quite strange position (from my java-newbie point of view): using Eclipse I wrote a "java program" (some .java files with classes into) which essentially (batch) reads a text *.csv file, "evaluates" its contents, and writes out results into an *_out.csv text file. To locate the input file it uses a "file chooser" (got sample from here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/filechooser.html) I debugged all the code and, using the debugger, it works. I ran the code (the main class, which calls all the other in sequence) and it works, while in Eclipse. I exported all the project's contents into a "runnable jar" file. Notice that, file chooser apart, this is mainly a "batch" which reads and writes: nearly no User Interface at all. While into Eclipse I shown some internal results using something like "if(debug) System.out.print("something to print");" providing to set "debug" TRUE while debugging and FALSE while in production environment. ALL of the above worked! Now, starting the runnable jar (double-click on the jar file, in Win/XP), I can see the file chooser and I can use it but, after choosing the input file... nothing more: (having no user interface) I don't know if the file was read, I don't see any generated output file, and I've even no "console" to list any intermediate debug message, to see if the jar is working, even if I re-export it with the debug variable set to TRUE. Is there a way to "runtime debug" the running jar (like VB's MsgBox, or something other)? some kind of "log file" I can "enable" or look into? (obviously, as my jar is not writing the result file, I just can't try writing a *.log too) I have also to say I just can't install other than Eclipse on my machine (and just been lucky it ran), so no usual developer's tools, utilities and other useful things.
I need to debug a Java application I have no source code for. It is running locally on a Jetty server. Decompiling using JD-GUI works fine. Attaching JDB via a socket connection or shared memory works fine, too. Where I fail is joining the pieces together. I mainly tried Eclipse with the JD-Eclipse plugin and remote debugging. I failed to find a way to successfully attach the debugger to a running process. Everything seems to assume that I have at least parts of the application available as source code in a project, but I have not. And it is quite a large application (200+ MiB of JAR files and 500+ MiB of other stuff) so trying to build a project from all the decompiled classes and getting this to run is not an option unless it is easy to automate. What I really need is being able to attach a debugger to a running process, see and navigate the decompiled code, set breakpoints and inspect variables and objects. It does not matter if the code could be recompiled. Conditional breakpoints and expression evaluation would be nice to have.
When I run my JUnit tests in IntelliJ and one of them fails, I would like to jump to the source code of the failing test by double-clicking it (or by right-clicking it and selecting "Jump to source" or "Show source") in the results view (in the list of failed tests in the "Run" view). However, this feature doesn't always work correctly. Sometimes the source code is shown and sometimes only the compiled ".class" file of the test is shown to me in the editor window. I would always like to see the source code (".java" file) instead of the ".class" file in the editor window after double-clicking the failed test. One solution for it is to click "Attach Sources..." in the editor window, where the ".class" file of the test class is displayed. However, I have to do it for every test file and it takes much time to do it repeatedly for every test. In my opinion IntelliJ should find the source code automatically, because it's present in my Project (it's my own class and its source code is in the project and I run this test from the Project view, where the classes with source code are visible). How can I configure IntelliJ, so that it finds the source code automatically for every unit test which I run? The ".class" files which are shown instead of the ".java" files are contained in a jar file which is built by Maven.
I'm sorry in advance, I cannot give a lot of information about the batch affected by the error. I would like to know generally what can cause an error on initializing a reader, when the XML input file is in the right repo. Are there any changes between spring batch v1 and spring batch v2 when initializing the reader process of a common simple step? We operated a migration of the batch to spring batch V2 a few days ago.

I have a Java program that parses several different input files. Even when an error is found in this input files, parsing could still continue and collect several other errors too. So what I want to do is instead of throwing and exception and stopping parsing process, I'd like to register the exception to somewhere, and then continue parsing and collect several other errors in similar way, then in the end I want to check if any errors are reported, and fail or continue depending on this. Of course I can always do this manually by writing ExceptionRegister or whatever classes but I want to know two things: 1) Is there a problem with this approach? Do you know any alternative designs for what I want to do? 2) Is there a standard way of doing this? (e.g. instead of rolling my own classes I'd like to use built-in functionality if possible) Thanks EDIT: I don't know why but someone just removed his answer just before I accepted his answer. Anyway, I think simple data structures should work. Basically, I'll write an exception class that collects several error messages. Then I'll call it's throw method which throws itself if it has at least one error message registered. EDIT2: Here are more clarifications. My problem has nothing to do with parsing. Parsing was just an example because my program does some parsing. Think this: I'm running an algorithm and in case of an error, I can continue the algorithm to collect more errors so that instead of printing one error and when it's fixed, printing second error, I can print this two errors together.

My root question is how to benefit from the 'unchecked generics type' Eclipse compiler warning, but not have the list of those warnings in the Problems view polluted by noise from java classes which are generated from xsd files by xjc (via maven-jaxb2-plugin.) I've read other places that I can ignore compiler warnings per source folder and that would be great, but I don't have the authority to place the generated code it it's own source folder. :( Given my situation, my assumption is that the easiest and most durable way to do this would be to use jaxb binding files (.xjb) to add @SuppressWarnings at the class level of all of the classes that jaxb generates. However I'm not very smart on using xjc, I just see how it/maven/eclipse are wired together to generate .java files from the .xsd files. So this leads to 2 questions. First, am I wrong to think this possible/easy? Second, if that is easy what's a good way at getting started on accomplishing this?
I am working on a java ee web application in NetBeans. I am trying to debug the behavior of the application but the behavior I'm seeing is confusing. I am running the application through NetBeans in Tomcat. Within NetBeans, I select "Debug" from the root of the Project Tree and I can send one request to the application I've written. Breakpoints are hit and I get unique results from the application. However, every subsequent time I try to send a request to my application, I get the exact same incorrect result (even if I clear the cache on Chrome) and the Netbeans IDE doesn't stop at any of the defined breakpoints. Is this to be expected? Does a Servlet get mangled in memory once it runs through the debugger once? Do I need to stop and restart/reattach the NetBeans debugger every time I want to debug the application? Is there something I'm doing wrong when using the debugger? Does this indicate a problem with the code I've written in my Servlet? Thanks, Jason Mazzotta
I am using mac 10.6.8 (snow leopard). I replaced the original JDK 6 installation with JDK 7 (which, incidentally, cannot be done in a completely clean way in my OS) so now the "java" command points to the jre in 7 and JAVA_HOME is set to the 7 installation too. I then installed maven 3.0.5 and finally spring roo through homebrew. When I try starting the roo shell I get the error message below. I have no clue as to the nature of the problem. Is there any way to pass a parameter to roo to use a difference jre, for example? $ roo Nov 12, 2013 10:38:53 PM org.springframework.roo.felix.JdkDelegatingLogListener logNow SEVERE:

Is there an easy way to translate JPA Exceptions to application exceptions? My Remote Session Bean in a Java EE Container (JBoss) is called by the client via RMI. The Session Bean gets a JPA Entity Manager injected and is writing something into the database. Transactions are handled by the container (JTA). If any exception occurs when writing to the database then this exception is thrown to the client. Since I'm using Hibernate I've got Hibernate Exceptions in the client. The client does not know any Hibernate libs and therefore I'm getting ClassNotFoundExceptions in the client. Now I would like to translate the exception in the container and throw an exception that my client can handle. I had the following ideas but all of them have a drawback I think: Avoid the JPA Exception e.g. by checking constraints before writing to the database. This means to duplicate DB constraints in business logic. Flushing the Entity Manager inside the business method and catching and translating any errors that might be raised during flush inside the method. Well, I like the idea that the Persistence Provider postpones any talking to the database as long as possible. Disabling Container Managed Transactions and doing transaction management in my own Interceptor. This way I can catch all exceptions that occur before or during commit and wrap them to my application exceptions. Use Spring JPA and Springs Exception Translation features. Well I'm already in a Java EE Container maybe there is some Java EE way to do Exception Translation?
In Eclipse, if I want to run an opened project using one of the Run configurations (e.g. a Junit test runner), Eclipse will prompt me if the project contains errors. The option is in (Run/Debug -> Launching -> Continue Launch if project contains errors). That's fine. Now, assume I have a project Child depending on Parent, and both projects are open in Eclipse. In my case, Child is a bunch of unit tests for Parent — which might be a suboptimal (but immutable) setup. If I change something innocuous in Parent, then run Child's tests, Eclipse rebuilds Parent, and then runs the tests of Child on a fresh Parent, which is OK. If I now change something in Parent that creates an error. and prevents Eclipse from rebuilding it, Eclipse will run Child's tests based on the latest succesful build of Parent. So I silently get test results for a prior version of the Parent project. This is very confusing because the Error markers will appear late (along Parent's rebuild) and I may not even be looking at them Is there a way to tell Eclipse to warn me if it didn't manage to rebuild the dependent projects, for which it already has the policy to update the build anyway ?
I followed the steps for importing the samples from Facebook SDK 3.5.2 in Eclipse ( https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/ ) but still get error when I try to run any of them. When I right-click on Scrumptious, SessionLoginSample or the other samples, I get this error. [2013-11-14 15:03:42 - Dex Loader] Unable to execute dex: java.nio.BufferOverflowException. Check the Eclipse log for stack trace. [2013-11-14 15:03:42 - SessionLoginSample] Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: java.nio.BufferOverflowException. Check the Eclipse log for stack trace. The Facebook SDK is connected right to the samples, its green and correct. It also says "your project contains errors, please fix them before running your application" The thing is, there is no error, no red dots or anything, just imported them, made an clean on the project, no errors, and still, it wont work. I know that Facebook dont update there example codes, tutorial codes or the samples even if they update the SDK, so what can the problem be? Thank you.
I am designing a Swing window for managing the information about a NonPlayerCharacter entity. The design is intended to be easily extensible. The main body of the editor form is contained inside a tabbed pane, so that future extension modules can add tabs to extend the editor. The tabbed pane can be populated by tabs that implement the NPCEditorTab interface. Part of the "Saving" process involves a loop that cycles through the tabs calling the verifyFields() method on each, ensuring that all fields are properly completed (I supposed to keep with convention I should rename this to validateFields()). If the validation of all tabs is successful, another loop calls the saveNPC() method for each tab, instructing them to write their data to the NPC object. My question is: What is the best method for tracking the validation of each tab so that the reasons for a failed validation can be reported to the user? I have two options: 1) Have the method throw a ValidationException. This ValidationException would contain information regarding the source tab and which form fields were incomplete and why, allowing the editor to report this to the user as a single message. I would probably collect exceptions as they occur in a collection and complete all the validations before reporting the results from all the tabs at once (to prevent a case of the user receiving an Error from Tab 2, fixing that, then oh, you also have an error in tab 4, etc). Reading on here and elsewhere suggestions that using exceptions for flow control is bad design, which is why I'm hesitant to use this option. 2) Have the method return a ValidationResult object. These ValidationResult objects would be added to a collection after each iteration and examined. They would contain a boolean flag (isValidated()), a source String identifying the source tab, as well as a List of Strings describing reasons for validation failure. In either case validation results would be reported to the user in a single dialogue. I don't personally see a problem with the first option, as to me (a self-taught Java enthusiast) it seems to the least performance impacting (an object is only generated in the event of a failure, as opposed to every time no matter what as with the second option). I have no experience with developing a custom API (I sort of enjoy feeling my way along and finding ways to handle problems on my own), but I am attempting to design this program to be extensible so that I can easily add functionality later without massive modifications to the existing code (I ran into this problem on my first iteration of this project, each new feature made the base code more and more convoluted until it became unmanageable). That is the reason I am handling form validation this way, I am just wary of including validation reporting in the individual tabs because I don't want the user to receive a unique notice for each individual tab. However, if you think the best method is to do just that (IE when a tab's validation fails, it notifies the user itself via JOptionPane and then returns false which terminates the validation check), let me know. Addendum Upon outside advice, I have decided to scrap the entire multi-tab validation scheme and instead validate on individual form elements by capturing lost-focus events and forcing the user to correct invalid input immediately after it is entered.
I have written an application that uses EMC Documentum Foundation Class library form performing some function on documentum repository. For that I first installed DFC Runtime Environment. It establishes certificates required for communication with Documentum Content server. When I run project through eclipse it works fine. But when I export it as Runnable JAR, and run it as java -jar it shows following exception It seems that when exported as JAR, the application is getting into some certificate related issues and trying to throw CertificateException, however it is not finding that class. I tried - by putting path to the jar certjFIPS.jar (which contains CertificateException) that is c:\Documetum\shared in classpath environment variable. - by adding it to project as an external jar But none worked. As I examine above stack trace, I realize that the excpetion is thrown by DFC runtime related classes which are running in some certificate related issue. However, it seems that while running through eclipse it is not facing any such issues. So I will like to know many things here even though the final exception is NoClassDefFoundError Firstly what should I do just to let JAR find CertificateException What are possible certificate related changes I have to do when running the same app as a JAR What should be different options I should select while exporting project as a JAR in eclipse so that certificate issues will not arise. Also as info, I created a link resource in project that points to c:\Documentum\config, which contains dfc.properties and also dfc.keystore. So also is there any way by which I can specify explicitly for JAR to use these two files while running?
Simple question: I am wondering why the Preferences method nodeExists() throws a BackingStoreException that must be caught? What would cause a BackingStoreException exactly, and of all the methods in the Preferences API, why does this method (and not all of the others) require it to be caught? Reading this paragraph from the Preferences API docs does not help me much: All of the methods that read preferences from a Preferences object require the invoker to provide a default value. The default value is returned if no value has been previously set or if the backing store is unavailable. The intent is to allow applications to operate, albeit with slightly degraded functionality, even if the backing store becomes unavailable. Several methods, like flush, have semantics that prevent them from operating if the backing store is unavailable. Ordinary applications should have no need to invoke any of these methods, which can be identified by the fact that they are declared to throw BackingStoreException. Maybe I don't understand it, but wouldn't the unavailability of the backing store be a risk for all Preferences methods? The paragraph above makes me think I am calling a method I "should have no need to invoke." Yet checking if a node exists seems like it'd be a common operation to me. Every time I call nodeExists() I have to add a try / catch block around it and handle the exception.
I am trying to use the Bloomberg API emulator instead of the actual Bloomberg API because as far as I understood you need to have a Bloomberg Terminal in order to use it and the emulator will be good enough for my project as I do not need real data to test it. So I have created a new project and imported the Jar file of the bbg emulator and I am able to run it but I get a runtime numberformatexception. Normally I would debug and fix the exception but since I am using the Jar file I do not know how to fix it. Does anyone have any experience with the bbg emulator with java? All I need is to send and receive basic data. If anyone can give some advice or any links It would be appreciated. I have the bbg api documentation
Gigaspaces 9.6, Java 6 I'm developing module system which dynamically load module's classes from external .jar files which are not in SYSTEM CLASS PATH. Each module has its own class loader (for sandboxing purpose). Once I've loaded TEMPLATE CLASS from external jar and register it to TypeManager, it causes the ClassNotFoundException.

Im running a 64bit windows 7. Im thinking that the main issue is that my laptop cannot run this large ontology. is there any way I could be wrong?

I have an application using Htmlunit and I needs to use a PAC file, but HtmlUnit shows an error and I don't know why. The PAC file is written in Javascript and it has ".cgi" extension.

I really am not sure how to ask this question but if it is not suitable for SO I am sorry. I have a getter method that accepts only an Integer. In my web form I have a hidden field that can be manipulated using firebug When the user hacks in a string it appears to be sent to the server I get various 'Error setting expression' errors in eclipse (obviously as it is trying to cast a string to an int) I check back in firebug and the value is still set to the string I check in the response and the string has definitely been sent to the server and then sent back by the server This is obviously a problem as someone could whack some script in it for some XSS THIS is easily fixed by adding and if invoked on a value range in the setter else sets to 0. My real question is... why if the compiler doesnt like the string casting to an int, does the server still allow it to be returned? I was expecting a big barf and for it to tell me NO! My fix at the moment is purely a hack as I do not understand it enough. To me, it feels like after the getter barfs, it goes somewhere else? Is this a Struts2 thing?
I have a Java POJO class that I use in my project for Jackson deserialization from JSON. This class has various members, but the important member to consider is of the type java.util.SortedMap. I want to add the equals() and hashCode() to this class in order for me to compare instances of these classes with each other. Therefore, I used Eclipse's source code generation tool to create these two methods. I get the following warning message from the IDE: The field type 'java.util.SortedMap' does not redeclare equals() and hashCode() - the resulting code may not work correctly. Note that my POJO object that I am trying to create equals() and hashCode() for does have members of different java.util interfaces, like List and Map, but there are no warning messages about lack of equals() or hashCode() for those two interfaces. I guess that a part of the problem is that I am not sure why implementation of SortedMap Jackson will deserialize JSON into. There are many different implementations of the SortedMap interface available in my classpath and some do override equals() and hashCode(), but it is still impossible (?) to know whether one of these implementations will be choses by Jackson. Is this warning message something that I need to worry about? Anyone know of any workarounds for this problem? Aside: I have no desire to use Lombok in this project. Update Filed the following bug for Eclipse: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=422184
I am using RAD 8. When I start the server in debug mode, it displays a error message states that JVM debug port 7779 is in use. I had this problem many times as I know this port was used by RAD. So I had to stop the process with image name "Java" under Window Task Manager>Processes. But however for the first time I face this issue without no such "java" process running in Window task manager. In my knowledge none of the IBM product does use this port presently. I have even tried to restart my system and started the RAD, but still the issue remained same. I deleted the profile and re-created a new one. After that I started in debug more. And it started without any error. But again to get all the resources imported from my friends server, I got his .car file. After importing this I started the server and got the same issue. Now wondering what could cause this port used issue when just importing the .car file. Can you please tell me how to know which application uses this port and how to stop it Is there a way I can change the debug port while creating the server profile? I tried to see the debug port in profile creation but didn't find anywhere. Friends please share me if you have any input. I will share if I get the root cause of this
We are running Eclipse BIRT embedded in our Web application and it worked perfect so far. We are heavily using Reports with Script-Datasources. Sometimes we use Javascript, nowadays we try to write Datasource providers directly in Java. I currently have a blocker issue, where I am running out of ideas, what the origin of problem could be. I am getting this exception: Invalid javascript expression: row["Name"] org.eclipse.birt.report.data.adapter.api.AdapterException: An exception occurred during processing. Please see the following message for details: A BIRT exception occurred. See next exception for more information.

(with eclipse/jetty setup) But it does not work on one particular machine, with this setup: Windows XP 32bit (virtual) Tomcat 6.0.30 / JRockit 1.6 JRE (Heap of 1500MB) unpacked deployment, all classes in JAR files. MySQL database I suspected classpath issues with Rhino JS engine. I checked dependencies... But it could not find the root cause. It is not the database content. I ran the scripted report with the exact same webapp code with same tomcat version, jre version and the same database content on my dev machine (with windows7 64bit) and it worked fine. Any help/ideas very much appreciated!

other pages I hit different java.lang.NoSuchMethodErrors. On pages that dont use any library classes it does not error, everything works. I have noticed that it is always on the first call to a class in a library outside of my main project. How come it does not see the classes from these libraries? Do I need to explode them? If so, how? Google was unhelpful when trying to find this information out. When I turn fast-swap to false, everything works. How to get fast-swap to work with my libraries? I wont be modifying the libraries. I just want my project to be able to see the library classes! I do not wish to switch to use JRebel or any 3rd part tool to help with redeploys/hot deploys.
please help me :( I'm a beginner in this. I have a 64 bits system with Ubuntu Gnome 13.10. I wanted to start developing in Android. So I downloaded the Android SDK from here http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html extract the files and all the process. Then I did this : " sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jdk icedtea-7-plugin " So I opened Eclipse and the message " error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1 " showed up in the console. I read I had to install some of the 32 bit libraries if I was using a 64 bit system, so put this in terminal: sudo apt-get install ia32-libs. It didn't work but tried with this : sudo apt-get install lib32z1 , sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5 , sudo apt-get install lib32z1. The first and the third worked. Thought everything was gonna be fine, opened Eclipse and Import a project, by File -> Import ... But all the code showed up with errors. Basically everything says "SomethingSomething cannot be resolved to a type" There are 85 errors like this. Also, I noticed that my R.java is missing, I tried creating a new project, named it "R.java" and pasting the code and saving it. Didn't work. I've tried on Project->Clean. And Right click, Android Tools, Fix Project Properties. Both did nothing. Tried changing API target to the latest, 19, but nothing. Read also that it could be the name of the package in the AndroidManifest.xml but everything appears to be fine in there. I also would like to say that I can create new projects. It creates the R.java and it works just fine. It's just importing. Could you please please help me? Any answer will be appreciated :)
Thanks in advance for your help. I am new to the Google developer tools and I have been messing around trying to figure out how to get one of their features to work. This one most specifically: https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/eclipse#Running_the_Project So this is how far I've gotten. I updated my Java package to 1.7. I installed the Google plug in for eclipse., I created a new project named "Guestbook", made sure the boxes were checked, run->DebugAs-> WebApplication, and then I get this huge error: Exception in thread "main" FATAL ERROR in native method: processing of -javaagent failed java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/google/appengine/tools/development/agent/AppEngineDevAgent : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(ClassLoader.java:637) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:621) at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:141) at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:283) at java.net.URLClassLoader.access$000(URLClassLoader.java:58) at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:197) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247) at sun.instrument.InstrumentationImpl.loadClassAndStartAgent(InstrumentationImpl.java:280) at sun.instrument.InstrumentationImpl.loadClassAndCallPremain(InstrumentationImpl.java:338) I don't know what all this means. I am still fairly new to java, so any help would be excellent. Hope all is well
Back to SO after a long time :-). I have deployed an ear for our application in Websphere (using this server for the first time). When I started the server, am getting a lot of errors (am not sure if it has got something to do with the bean configurations in the code). I have attached the errors with this post. Can you please shed some light on it ? Am I missing something? Do jars need to be placed explicitly in some location? Log 1 Log 2 I have been breaking head with this for more than 2 days now. Did all the search in Google but no clue where to start or what exactly is going wrong. (i) I am able to deploy ear successfully. (ii) When I start the server, am getting all the errors which I attached in the logs. (iii) I am able to launch the application successfully (Can see the login page), but when I login, I get a 'WebPage CAnnot be found'. Well I can see the url changing as 'siteminderagent/forms/login.fcc'. This should be some kind of 3rd party authentication tool. I need to do some configuration for the same somewhere ?
I have a small problem with my Samsung Galaxy Y. I took the .vcf file to my pc, deleted some contacts with the txt editor and saved the file (I had written a script in R to do the same work and I had the same problems, so I did it manually too, to see if the problem still exists). I did the work fine, started the deletion from the begin vcard and deleted all the contact to vcard end line. But when I try to import my contacts (from this file) to my catalog it gives an error message: Expected String "BEGIN:VCARD" did not come (Instead "!>>?BEGIN:VCARD" came) I opened it to the phone txt editor and there were these symbols on the beggining of this text file. In winXP they do not appear, as well as in OpenSuSE... so what is happening and how I can get rid of them (so my R script works fine)? *I asked the question in the android forum but got no answer. So I am asking this here. Maybe I have more luck now because there are so so many people here with programming skills so maybe they know the answer.
I am working on some project to practice my skills. My project has a SOA and consists of a application server on one machine , and a database server on another machine. The clients that use this system can be both web and phones. I started to make all the communications within all the components (including the clients) RESTFull. However, soon I realised that there are limitations to this approach. Especially on the clients and app server side. The biggest issue I faced is that how I can propagate an error to a client. Lets say the client send a request to modify a record in the database. So the request is sent to the app server and the app server will call the database server to do the job. If for some reason something goes wrong, I want the client(web or phone) to know about it (near real-time). One option would be manually propagate the error up to my controller and put the error message in the response to the request and send it back to the client as a response. But I have a feeling that this is not the right way to do it. Is there a better way? I am using Java so any pointers to any documents, blogs, libraries and technologies that can help me with this are welcome. thanks
I keep getting the LineUnavailableException on line 34 of my code: https://www.refheap.com/21223 The error reads as javax.sound.sampled.LineUnavailableException: line with format PCM_SIGNED 44100.0 Hz, 16 bit, mono, 2 bytes/frame, little-endian not supported.. I'm creating multiple instances of the Sound class (implemented in my refheap paste). It seems that the first instances have no problem. But when I start making new instances of Sound objects using the same audio file then I start getting this error. Any idea how to fix it? EIDT: I think the ByteArrayInputStream idea from this question might be what I need to do, but I'm not sure how yet. EDIT: I thought I found a solution in this forum thread on how to play the same sound simultaneously, but after changing my code, I still get the same problem. Here's my updated code, but now the error happens on line 88: https://www.refheap.com/21224

I have been experimenting a bit with web service when I stumbled on a situation. The relevant details are: I am using eclipse,cxf and tomcat. I created a simple web service which prints hello. It does not have any arguments in its method. When I call this web service from a client everything works fine. But, when I create a web service with arguments in the method, I am getting a weird exception: Exception in thread "main" javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException: Unmarshalling Error: unexpected element (uri:"----", local:"loginid").

I've got a problem regarding Java Builds in Jenkins. The Error I resolve is the following one: Unable to locate the Javac Compiler in: C:\Jenkins\jre\..\lib\tools.jar Please ensure you are using JDK 1.4 or above and not a JRE (the com.sun.tools.javac.Main class is required). In most cases you can change the location of your Java installation by setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable. I got JDK1.6 and JDK1.7 projects, so I need two JDK installations. For my default Java JDK I used the 1.6 for the JAVA_HOME variable, which points to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_45. Same for the 1.7 version, but in a separated variable (JAVA_HOME7). The PATH variable contains the appended \bin to the two JDK versions. In Jenkins I also added both versions for JDK and as helper variables. If I am setting a concrete version for a project (e.g. JDK1.7), then it's building without any issues. Unfortunately I've got a lot of build-projects, so it would be time consuming to set this manually. I don't understand where the call or variable for the path of the error C:\Jenkins\jre\..\lib\tools.jar is set and where I can modify it... Jenkins Version: 1.509.4 Any hints or advices how to solve this problem?
I am trying to make some modifications to JEdit which is stored using SVN (Its a project). I have installed TortoiseSVN and got the files from the server into my pc. Then I imported the files as a existing project into Eclipse. The problem now is that it gives me the following warnings when I compile and run it. 1:15:26 PM [main] [warning] jEdit: jedit.jar not in class path! 1:15:26 PM [main] [warning] jEdit: Assuming jEdit is installed in E:\College\SEProj\jEdit. 1:15:26 PM [main] [warning] jEdit: Override with jedit.home system property. 1:15:26 PM [main] [warning] jEdit: initPLAF failed to set required l&f 1:15:26 PM [main] [warning] jEdit: initPLAF failed to set required l&f And It also gives an Error 'The project cannot be built until build parts are resolved.' (I was able to solve this error by importing all the jar files, due to some reason, I also had to import tools.jar) Whatever changes I make in the source code, makes no changes at compile time. I even tried to delete an entire class and still there was no change in execution. Is it due to this? Or something else?
I have created a stateless EJB annotated with the @WebServiceProvider annotatoin and made it point to a WSDL file I created (contract first web services) and implemented the Interface javax.xml.ws.Provider. the web service is correctly started in JBoss and I can consume it using SoapUI. I would like to enhance the web service a little bit so that it gives error responses back to SoapUI, my ideal situation would be throwing a RuntimeException from the invoke() method and see it's stacktrace back in SoapUI log, but I cannot nail it. I also tried returning a javax.xml.transform.Source object but I see nothing in the SoapUI log. Reading a little bit I came across this phrase on this link: The faults are returned to the sender only if request/response messaging is in use. If a Web service operation is configured as one-way, the SOAP fault is not returned to the sender, but stored for further processing. So I guess the answer to my question is to have a request/response messaging in use but how can I do that is it something to configure in the WSDL or in the Java classes?

We used to have a EAR that included an EJB jar and a WAR. From the EJB we sent a dto class to the WAR. Everything was fine. Now we have tried to extract the WAR from the EAR and created a EJB-client (API jar) that the WAR uses. This API jar includes the dto class that we send from the EJB to the WAR. In the EAR the API is deployed in the lib directory. In the WAR we have the same API jar in WEB-INF/lib directory. But now we get a ClassCastException when accessing the internals of the dto class. The method call to the EJB goes ok and we can assign the resulting List in the WAR. But when we try to read a value from the DTO class we get ClassCastException. We have checked over and over again so the API jar is not imported twice somewhere in the EAR or the WAR. But now we are at the brink of giving up. Anybody have any idea what we are doing wrong?

I have been struggling with this issue all day now and would appreciate some help for this community. I'm trying to get an Android project started using the Google App Engine as the backend on eclipse. I got the App Engine setup on Google's Cloud Platform and now I just need to integrate it with my Android project eclipse using Entity and Endpoints. (reading this tutorial: https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/endpoints-addentities) After downloading Google's eclipse plugin for eclipse 4.2 under "Install New Software", I obtain the appengine-java-sdk1.8.8, but under Preferences -> Google -> AppEngine, the sdk is not there. So I tried adding it, putting "(eclipse-path)/plugins/com.google.appengine.eclipse.sdkbundle_1.8.8/)" but it says: Failed to initialize App Engine SDK at (Path of AppEngine SDK) I have been looking for a solution to this issue for all of today and so far, I've tried: -Changing around permissions with chmod -Installing Java SE 1.7.0_45 (the latest version) and switching the JRE back and forth from 1.6 and 1.7 -tried out both Eclipse 3.7 and 4.2.2 I am running Mac OSX Mountain Lion.

I was wondering if there were some gurus here who could help me with the following problem. I have a Siemens S7-1200 PLC that I am accessing via HTTP and the built-in web server in the PLC. The PLC has been set up with a very simple web page that has two tags on it inside a HTML FORM so that the page can be loaded and new values for the tags written to the PLC. This has been tested from a browser and works well. Then I have a Java application which connects to the PLC 2-3 times each hour, loads the page with a GET, writes a new value into either tag field (a value of 1) and then POSTs the page back to the web server. This also works well. However, before the page with the tag fields can be loaded, the HTTP client must log in with a user/pass via another page in the PLC web server. The Java application actually does this and then gets the tag page, updates a tag and posts the page. The problem is that this will run fine for weeks and then suddenly the web server will start returning error 500 during the login phase: 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR Turning the PLC off and back on makes everything start working again, but this is still not good because the PLC and Java app are supposed to ring a school bell on a certain schedule and when this problem occurs everyone will sit there waiting for it to ring, but it doesn't :-) Not a lot of info to go on, I know, I was mostly hoping someone else had had a similar problem and had some insight into why that occurred. I am not a PLC expert so I don't know if there is a log or anything like that on the PLC that could be studied. For further info, I am using the Apache HTTP client library to talk to the PLC web server from the Java app. Thanks in advance, Hordur Thordarson
I am looking for a little troubleshooting assistance on this one. We have a custom integration written in Java that pulls information out of Rally (Artifact type, ID, state, owner, project and some other custom data) and drops it into a Perforce job. We use this to verify that things are approved/reviewed before we move code around. So the integration has been up and running for about 6 months and is working great and two days ago it starts failing...but it only fails when the Rally Task in question has html formatting in the description field...the error it produces is: ERROR: Error: Job Loader Script [/p4/1/tmp/P4Rally.prod/TA14875.sh] did not run. When all formatting is removed from the description field the integration works and runs just like it is supposed to. We have not updated the java files for the integration in probably 6 weeks. Our Perforce install has not been updated/changed. Perforce resides on a Linux machine and I verified we haven't made any changes to the machine itself. Rally is hosted and I have a question out to their support team to see if anything has changed on the data management/formatting/anything side for them. I am out of ideas for what could cause this issue. Any suggestions for threads to follow?
I have code which deletes all of the files in a directory except for the last n most recently modified ones. The code gets a list of File objects from a directory, sorts them using a comparator which looks at File.lastModifedTime(), then deletes the appropriate sublist. When we upgraded to Java 7, the program started throwing java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Comparison method violates its general contract!. I suspect that this is because a file is modified (normal behavior) before sorting is completed so the comparator is returning inconsistent values as it check each file's last modified time. My question is, how would you solve this problem and delete the right files? One suggestion I read was to store the file and it's last modified time in a map before sorting so when comparisons are done, the last modified time is looked up from the map. However, if the file changed mid sort, the map isn't updated so wouldn't you end up deleting the wrong file? Other idea I thought of was using Java NIO's file watch to keep a sorted list and re-sort whenever a file changes. But that seems fairly complicated. I also thought of a brute force method of wrapping the sort in a try-catch statement and just retry the whole sort if it runs into the comparison method violation. Lastly, I could just set the java.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort property and go back to the silently ignore ways of Java 6.
I'm currently dealing with the usual flakiness of the latest version of Chrome and ChromeDriver with Selenium. I'm running my tests using Grid 2 and a couple of Windows 7 machines. I'll get the occasional inevitable dead browser tab being reported by ChromeDriver. Since these tests didn't really fail as far as the web app functionality, I'd like to mark them as skipped to keep reporting a bit more useful for my current purpose. I've tried getting them to re-run, but TestNG's support for this is experimental and currently broken. Is there a way I can set these tests to a SKIPPED status before they're logged in my Gradle report? (I'm using Gradle for reporting instead of ReportNG since ReportNG doesn't work properly with parallel testing). I'm thinking I need to add another listener and somehow pick up the reported stack trace, check for a particular string, and then set the set to SKIPPED. Is this the correct approach? Any tips on how to accomplish this would be great. I'm not able to find a way to capture the stack trace with my listener yet, and most importantly, set the test to a SKIPPED state (once the trace is parsed). I am using Java to drive these tests. Any ideas / help would be much appreciated! Cheers, Darwin
I am trying build my UI project in hudson server. I am getting junit failures in Hudson. When I build the project locally, build is successful. I am trying to execute clean and deploy goals(maven 2.2.1) in Hudson.

I couldn't find if this question was asked before, sorry if it was. I'm building an application, the MainActivity extends FragmentActivity because I have two ViewPagers that shows my fragments. I don't know why, at the beginning I was debugging my app without problems, but after some development I can't debug my app anymore. When I start debugging, it shows "Waiting for debbuger", then when my activity launch, it stops into white window, I have to remove my USB cable to access my application. I have no error logs, no crash warnings, nothing, my app runs without any problem, I have no problems to plug my USB cable again. The only thing that is showed on my pc is and DexFile.class saying the following, but I don't know how it works: "Source not found The JAR file ...\sdk\plataforms\android-16\android.jar has no source attachment. You can attach the source by clicking Attach Source below..." I created a TestActivity with a single Text View, I had no problem with the debugger, the problem looks to be on my MainActivity. I have friends with the same problem, but we couldn't find a solution, I also tried: Window >> Open Perspective >> DDMS >> View Menu >> Reset ADB, but nothing changed. What is wrong? As I said, no errors on my logCat, my app does not crash, nothing, I'm facing some problems with my Service but I believe they are happening because of this issue. Thanks in advance and forgive my English.
I have a Tomcat/Eclipse running a dynamic web project. This includes a known good .war as it's main codebase. The mail .jar is mail.1.4.5.jar. When used locally, the setup, when configured accurately, delivers email via tests no problem. It can deliver to a variety of ports, and two very different SMTP servers. But when deployed to Jelastic, the app fails to deliver mail. I could list the errors, they are several, including reports on transport issues. The key error, which may provide some answers, is that when Java Mail, on the Jelastic deployment, is configured to port 25, the mail is reported by the app as having been delivered. This works on both servers. But the mail never arrives. I've checked junk, too, to make sure the mail was not caught by anti-spam. The problem seems to be quite narrow - only port 25 is working on the mail delivery, and Java Mail thinks it has succeeded. But there are many reasons why the mail may not have arrived, and I'm not sure where to start or, in some cases such as catching outbound mail, how to debug. This question may be related to, Grails mail delivery works fine locally but if this is the same issue, then the problem is Java-wide, not limited to Grails.
This is not a duplicate of How to come out of while loop during debugging. See the comment on this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/8107702/1391924 by the author of this question. While debugging, we can use short-cut keys like F8 to resume, F7 to step return, F5 to step into, F6 to step over. Is there any short-cut key to skip loops (for,while and do-while) while debugging Java code? In the picture shown below Currently debug cursor is at line no 57. Is there any short cut key when pressed it debug cursor should come out of innermost loop (for,while or do-while. Here while loop) and pause at next executable statement (i.e excluding comments. Here line no 64). And when again pressed this key it should come to line number 66. Edit: Not got any satisfied answer. Raised a bug here. Please vote up and request this feature in next JDT release.

Following up on my previous question about importing a certain library from github in my project, I decided I wanted to implement a different one, but I get lots of errors at this point. Importing Android Listview refresh by pull, project-properties error In line with Google currently using Chris Banes' ActionBar-PullToRefresh: https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh, I've decided I wanted to used that library as well for the Android app that I'm currently developing for my internship. When I try to import the existing code into the workspace from the unpacked zip-file though, I instantly get a ton of errors, in the library as well as in the example activities. For instance, in the library folder, in ActionBarPullToRefresh.java, it underlines Class within the first private hashmap and says references to the generic type Class should be parameterized. The IDE (eclipse) also gives tons of errors to the other folders included, and when I add the library folder to the libraries of my main project, using the properties -> android tab, it carries over the errors to that project (quite logically). Could anyone send me into a direction as to how I should successfully import and use this library?
I've pulled helloworld-spring-webapp from https://github.com/marko-asplund/jersey.git and tried to deploy it onto the latest Glassfish 4 application server, using java ee-7 (jdk 1.7.0_45) and jersey 2.3-SNAPSHOT. Deployment fails with this error: Error occurred during deployment: Exception while loading the app : CDI deployment failure:WELD-001408 Unsatisfied dependencies for type [Ref] with qualifiers [@Default] at injection point [[BackedAnnotatedParameter] Parameter 1 of [BackedAnnotatedConstructor] @Inject org.glassfish.jersey.server.internal.routing.UriRoutingContext(Ref, ProcessingProviders)]. Please see server.log for more details. My installed version of Jersey on Glassfish 4 is 2.0-0.1, with an update available to move to 2.0-0.2. I attempted this because I'm getting similar errors attempting to get CDI working with an application I'm working with, so it's fortunate to find that this example also fails with similar results. Does anyone know how to make this deploy and function correctly with Glassfish 4? Edit: I pulled a mirror image of that example and pulled it again from the source (here: https://github.com/jersey/jersey/tree/2.4.1). I can deploy that sample. There is a reference to a jira item JERSEY-2032 in the latest pom of the helloworld-spring-webapp. So now I need to figure out what was done differently between versions that makes this sample deploy correctly so that I can make the same changes to my work-in-progress application.
I have an android application that contains 3 Activities . each one contains one Fragment and each fragment fires 3-7 loaders to load data from Server and display them in ListView using MegeAdapter by commonsware. Any way while using the app on Nexus 4 (android 4.4) i got an out of memory exception . I played around the MAT tool but the Big object reside in (reminder) area which is not selectable . I can't view them . Note: In developer option if i check don't keep activies and make the Background process limit to "No background process" then the heap size remains between 10.500 MB to 12.00 MB (using the Update heap in DDMS). What should i do to make the same effect so i keep the heap size nice like this ? I can't find leaks in my application !! also note : I don't have any service component running in the application . i have set largeHeap="true" UPDATE : FROM MAT I GOT YOU SOME SCREEN SHOTS
I am creating a hash table in java, and need to do some analysis. One of my analysis tasks is to compare the number of slots in a hash table that have more than one value attached (the percentage of hash clashes, in essence). Given a prime number (arbitrary decision), I fill the hash table with random numbers. The amount of randoms I generate is equal to 0.8*primeNumber. I am using separate chaining to handle hash clashes. Although the array in the hash table stores nodes, each node can point to another node (so it is really an array of linked lists). My problem is when I am trying to traverse the bucket (our array holding nodes) to see if each position in the array (each node) has a next element (by next element I mean a next node, which means that a hash clash occured at that position). I am encountering a null pointer exception consistently, and it seems to be when I am checking if a node is pointing to a next ndoe.

My problem is when I am trying to traverse the bucket (our array holding nodes) to see how many nodes in the tree in total hash to a single value. So, for example, if our function is value%prime, and our prime is 5, and we generate the numbers {10, 5, 2, 7, 15, 4, 23}, then we will have 10, 5, and 15 hash into a single value (0, because 5%5 is 0, likewise for 10 and 15}, and also 2 and 7 will hash into the same value (5%7 = 2) thats a total of 3 + 2 or 5 things hashing into 1 value (basically, the problem is to find the number of hash collisions).
I am trying to perform map reduce on Pentaho 5. For Pentaho 5, the Pentaho applications come pre-configured for Apache Hadoop 0.20.2 and it says no further configuration is required for this version. I installed Hadoop 0.20.2 on windows using cygwin and every thing works fine. I run a simple job on Pentaho, which copies file in HDFS which finished successfully and the file system was copied into HDFS. But as soon as I run map reduce job, it says the job was finished on pentaho but the map reduce task was failed and on the output directory on HDFS the result is missing and the log file says: Error: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.pentaho.di.trans.step.RowListener at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:366) at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:355) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:354) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:308) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357) at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method) at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:270) at org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.getClassByName(Configuration.java:762) at org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.getClass(Configuration.java:807) at org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.getClass(Configuration.java:833) at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobConf.getMapRunnerClass(JobConf.java:790) at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask.runOldMapper(MapTask.java:354) at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask.run(MapTask.java:307) at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Child.main(Child.java:170 Please Help me out.
In hibernate, @ManyToOne relationship hardly results any problem since default fetch type is eager. However, we encounter critical problems at the @OnetoMany end. As we attempt to fetch a collection, 'LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy' is thrown since the default fetch type is lazy for one-to-many. In such case, we shall either set: @LazyCollection(LazyCollectionOption.FALSE), which although it resolves the problem, it hits the performance significantly when there are bunch of records. Fetch mode: left join but it thows org.hibernate.HibernateException: cannot simultaneously fetch multiple bags According to my knowledge, hibernate suggests couple of mechanisms to overcome this issue: Option 1 Specifying @IndexColumn instead of making LazyCollectionOption.FALSE. As a consequnce, the following behaviors are identified which also impacts on the performance: A temporary table is created with primary keys of respective entities (@OnetoMany). So when there are many 'one-to-many' relationships, temporary table is created for each. Option 2 Changing data type of collection from List to Set. This is leads to a problematic situation at the front-end with Struts 2 because Set is index based collection as we need to add records dynamically in an iterative manner. In order to overcome this issue, we shall make use of DTOs to capture UI inputs. By making collection type List in DTO and Set in 'domain', and by having assembler we shall do the required conversion from List → Set (DTO → Domain), and vice versa. Is the resolution mentioned under option 2 a viable solution? If not, please provide suggestions and feedback.
My application was running fine on tomcat 5.5 but now i want to use tomcat 7.I am getting issue if i use tomcat 7. I found on net and saw that people getting this issue.

I am new to web design. I am using eclipse IDE, Mac OS X, tomcat server and mysql database. I created a dynamic web project. In one of my web pages, i created a login page. I am checking the username and password with the database in servlet. As I am using servlet, I need to display the error message on the new page. I don't want to do that... Now, I want to display the error message on the same page... While I try to know which is better for server side checking and display the message instantly, I found PHP or AJAX are best options. But I am unable to use PHP in my project. I installed PHP software into the eclipse... and added some code in the web.xml of the project. But not able to run the PHP file on Tomcat server. To run the PHP files, I am using XAMP. But they are running only the PHP files not html and JSP. Here is the issue with PHP... How to run php file in eclipse juno So, please tell me which is the best option to achieve my goal.
I'll preface this by saying that I made an error by walking away from my code after a long session of coding. To my dismay I'm now receiving an IndexOutOfBoundsException when I do a certain function in the game I'm developing. I'd love to post the code to help locate the problem. The thing is I'm having trouble finding where in my 3,500 + lines of code the problem really lies. I've tried removing a few different methods in hopes that it would reveal the culprit but this was to no avail. Here is what I do know for sure. I set a break point at a place in the code slightly before where The error occurs. The method I placed it before runs and finishes with no problem according to log entries I set in the logcat. in debug mode it seems that the engine is catching an exception. Here is the logcat message: 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): FATAL EXCEPTION: UpdateThread 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Invalid index 6, size is 6 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at java.util.ArrayList.throwIndexOutOfBoundsException(ArrayList.java:251) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at java.util.ArrayList.get(ArrayList.java:304) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.engine.handler.UpdateHandlerList.onUpdate(UpdateHandlerList.java:47) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.entity.Entity.onManagedUpdate(Entity.java:1395) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.entity.scene.Scene.onManagedUpdate(Scene.java:284) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.entity.Entity.onUpdate(Entity.java:1167) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.engine.Engine.onUpdateScene(Engine.java:591) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.engine.Engine.onUpdate(Engine.java:586) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.engine.FixedStepEngine.onUpdate(FixedStepEngine.java:52) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.engine.Engine.onTickUpdate(Engine.java:548) 12-15 00:41:46.866: E/AndroidRuntime(3395): at org.andengine.engine.Engine$UpdateThread.run(Engine.java:820) Is anyone familiar with a problem similiar to this? I've read a few posts about similar problems where there was an object being disposed causing the error. I'd love it if that were the case, I just cant find anything that would be getting disposed and causing this problem.
I have an app that needs to be build on linux. it has a web interface(hence, the Selenium). In order to test functionality I install the app on a linux VM and have another windows VM running windows XP. My bamboo instantiates these two machines, installs the app on linux and runs a selenium test from the windows machine to test some things out. The problem is that my test, which is based on IE driver, it always fails when searching for a specific element(a checkbox) be it by xpath or id, it doesn't matter. It fails when the build is ran from Bamboo only! If I run the test from my workspace it works crystal clear on the windows machine and it's OK. But when bamboo calls it, it always fails searching for that one element; element that it normally finds. I can't understand why it would work if I run it, but it wouldn't work if I run it from Bamboo build. here is the process: upload a file->click create->goes to another page->searches for the checkbox and gives the timeout exception P.S. The test itself uploads a file. When i run the test from my workspace this happens normally, but when I run it from Bamboo it freezes a little there before it continues, but eventually resumes. Don't know if it is relevant P.S.2 i'm sorry for not being too specific, this is a work related problem and I can't say much. UPDATE It seems that when the file is uploaded, the IE kinda freezes for some seconds(20-30 or so). Strange thing is that it freezes only when ran from bamboo, when I run it, it works great, it sends the keys(filepath/file) to the file element immediately. On the bamboo on the other hand, when it freezes it seems the selenium test doesn't wait for the operation to finish and moves on. This is the reason i think it can't find the element. It's not a normal system freeze("not responding"), it just waits for a while then resumes. If the selenium moves onward, this might explain why it can't find my webelement, since is not on that page. I will come back to this
I'm trying to consume a Webservice in Java. Therefore, I've downloaded the WSDL-file from this site. The first error message i got after trying it in IBM Domino Designer is: wsdl2 emitter timed out (content too large to handle) The wsdl is quite big, so maybe the file is just too large for IBM Domino to handle. The second error message after trying it in Eclipse J2EE with Axis2Codegen Wizard is: An error occurred while completing process -java.lang.InterruptedException: java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in path at index 22: file:/C:/Users/XYZ/Softlayer/ And now I'm here, having no idea what character causes the problem. Since I'm quite new to SOAP / Webservices, there may be a chance that I'm doing something totally wrong. Otherwise there must be a problem with the .wsdl-file itself. Question: Do you have an alternative idea who to consume the .wsdl? Are you able to consume this file, or do you get the same error message?

Redirecting to job history server The strange thing is that after these errors keeping appearing for about minutes, they'll stop, and the correct output shows up at the bottom. So Hadoop is running fine and computing the proper output. The problem is just these connection errors that keep popping up. and that causing increase in execution time of the script. One thing that I have noticed is that whenever this error appears, the job had created and ran multiple JAR files during the job. However, after a few minutes of these message popping up, the correct output finally appears. I have 5 nodes cluster 1 namenode and 4 datanode. All the daemons are running fine. Any suggestions on how to get rid of these messages?
I have a Java application that is launched from a jnlp file off of a website. I'm trying to get it to run without flashing up a bunch of security warnings before it runs. The program is broken up into about 10 different jar files, 30 or so jar libraries, and a couple native libraries also contained in jar files. I've signed all of the jar files with an official code signing cert (from Verisign), included the jnlp file inside of the jar file that holds the main class, and added permissions and codebase attributes to the main 10 jars that I'm compiling. When I launch the program I get the message stating: This application will be blocked in a future Java security update because the JAR file manifest does not contain the Permissions attribute. Please contact the Publisher for more information. I can click "Run" to get past this message, but then I get: Block potentially unsafe components from being run? The application contains both signed and unsigned code. I've added the permissions attribute to all of the jar files that I'm compiling. Do I have to update the jar manifest for the third-party libraries that I'm using as well? If so, is there an easy way to do this? I'm using Apache Ant to build the application.
My question refers to a previously asked question on stackoverflow which was never answered: Why does weblogic's "not found" behavior change after the first attempt? In my case, I'm implementing a SAML solution to log in from the identity provider to the external service provider. The external service provider (ESP) is hosted on weblogic 9.2.3. On my first attempt after i startup weblogic to SSO-login to the ESP service provider, i can see in the logs that the app proceeds to build a redirect url normally. On the response.sendRedirect() call, I see that the ESP has received a new request to the "home login" page -- the page users would be directed to if they weren't logged in. It seems to not know it (the servlet) has already been initialized, and then acts as if there is no login session and forwards to the login form page (as if they've not been logged in). I've checked all the weblogic logs and our application logs, but there's no clue as to why this is happening. I've seen this on other weblogic sso projects before. It wasn't a problem with those because those other projects typically had a high volume of users logging in through the ESP form before the first SSO request was made. (It only takes one attempt.) Also, because of the volume on previous projects, i wasn't able to consistently reproduce the problem...until now. The previous stackoverflow post of this nature (which wasn't answered) is the only relevant search result google gives me. Big thank you to anyone who has some insight as to what the problem is.
I just encountered something that defies my understanding of logic. How can the situation below occur? I've tried all the usual approaches to remedy this; clean/build, restart netbeans, etc. but the problem persists. Variable complete is always true, no matter what I do. I even replaced left and right with true and false boolean values respectively, but no change. What did work, was a refactor rename of the variable, but when I changed it back to the original, the problem resurfaced. There are no class members named the same way. What's going on? Have I finally lost my mind, or should that variable have a value of false? This is with Netbeans 7.3.1 on Windows. Edit01 I'll try to prove it to the unbelievers that this is actually happening, when I get access to my work computer in a week or so. In the mean while, just take my word for it. THIS IS NOT A PRANK nor did it happen due to my lack of knowledge of debugging with Netbeans. I do remember doing a bunch of svn switch-to-copy commands before this occurred, but not for the project where this code resides in (dependencies). A clean/build should have taken care of any inconsistencies anyways. I also did not remember to clear the Netbeans cache, which I now regret. Edit02 Haters gonna hate, but as I feared, after returning to my workstation, I can no longer reproduce this issue. It pisses me off to admit this, but I have no proof whatsoever that this had ever happened. All I did was: woke up my pc from hibernation, undid a refactor rename of my variable, which was the last thing I had done before finishing my work, a clean/build and then another debug run. Everything just..works.
Can someone explain why this code is throwing an exception when I attempt to run the job on local file system? I am new to Hadoop/Cascading and am trying to get multiple columns per line and count the frequency of the values in those columns (without differentiating about from which column key they came from) I'm at a loss. If someone can explain to me where my thought process went astray, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm more concerned with learning the technology and its library than producing working code.

Goal I'm currently developing an application in Netbeans using the Netbeans Platform on Windows (a cross-platform solution would be wonderful but something hacky for Windows if required is fine for now). The application communicates with a native C++ DLL through JNA. The DLL sits in a specified directory which I cannot control or change - say C:\DLL. The DLL itself loads some files for reading in values etc. but it does this using relative paths. So it requires the "current" directory to be C:\DLL. Again, this is something I can't change in this project. The DLL is something I have to communicate with as is (unfortunately). Problem For regular JAVA applications I've had the option in Netbeans to set the working directory of the launched application like shown below: http://i.imgur.com/3HuQKS8.png But in the Netbeans Platform framework/template there are no such options. For the most part it looks like Netbeans just makes the directory of the current file I have focused in the Editor pane to be the Current Working Directory. So how do I go about doing this? I might be able to run the application through a shortcut that sits in C:\DLL but this doesn't help when I'm debugging the application through Netbeans. I want to know how I can run/debug this Netbeans Platform application with the current working directory set. Clarifying Netbeans Platform The Netbeans Platform is an application framework of sorts. Has a pre-defined structure based on "modules" that interact to form the full application. The whole thing is hosted inside the Netbeans Platform environment which provides each of your modules with tabbed/docking windows. Kind of nice to develop larger applications. More information here: https://netbeans.org/kb/trails/platform.html
I'm trying to run a processing sketch in eclipse. I've been doing this for quite a while, but have only recently updated to 2.1. The sketch runs fine when running the software mode. But when I try to use the P2D mode I get the error below. I have included all the jogl jars from the processing folder. I'm not sure if I should add native libraries though, I can't seem to find them.

I am new to Java and started with Eclipse Kepler Service Release 1. I started a small project that contains two classes, each in its own file: MIDI_Wrap_Test - a main (program) class MIDI_Wrap - another class (MIDI_Wrap) which is intended as a MIDI wrapper. - Both classes are in the same directory with file names being the same as the class name (with .java added of course). Something goes wrong and I want to debug it. However, when control transfers from the main program to the MIDI_Wrap file/class I get the error message 'source not found'. I found out that this is a quite common error. The question and answer that seem to mirror my problem perfectly is found here. I added the project to the debug source path, noticing that the correct directories were already added but to no avail. I must be doing something wrong but am not able to find out what. Can someone help me out of this?
1) We Created a Restaurant POS using JavaFX. 2) We have one main application and all other activity will open in Dialog which extend stage. This Stages are in memory always even after closing the stage using stage.close(). 3) The worse case is if I open the dialog multiple time memory leak is happening. eg: first call of stage need 30 MB memory next call to stage cause 60 MB usage and will continue like this 30MB, 60MB, 90MB, 120MB....................etc. 4) We took a painful approach to solve this issue once waiter ordered and click finish button we call System.exit(0) and reopen the jar file using Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("java -jar BookingFX.jar"); so every time the waiter have to wait a little to reopen the application. 5) As programmers we got very a bad image because this memory leak, We did this POS using SpringFrame work and MySQL and it is a three month of effort and I am the one who suggested the JavaFX for development instead of swing . We tried JDK8 early access to check for any hope but failed. Now our boss is asking us to move towards Windows programming using Visual C++ or Any other platform.

Note: I'm new to Stack Overflow. This is my first question. Let me know if I don't post the question correctly, or if I'm missing something that needs to be added in to the explanation. I'm on a team that has an android project that is running into an SVN out of date error. The out of date error occurs whenever we try and commit our project changes. We have tried updating the project at the file we are changing and at the head and the out of date error persists. We have tried checking the project out on different computers and the error still occurs. We have tried using subclipse, and SmartSVN and the error still occurs. The original creator can update and commit changes with out getting the out of date error. We have tried just about everything we have seen searching through google. As stated before we have tried updating the project, checking it our brand new, and everything that should work, but none of it seems to make the out of date error go away. The following is a few other things we have found in our efforts: 1 - It does not seem to be an eclipse problem. I made a change in TextEdit on the project after freshly checking it out from the repository, the same out of date error occurred when trying to commit the change via SmartSVN. 2 - Deleting the following .SVN folder files did not fix the problem svn.867f2d17-4301-0010-8283-dd8934b422cc.tmp wc.db.smartsvn-backup-1387663284-000000256443-000000256443-SvnUpdate.pre wc.db.smartsvn-backup-1387663284-000000259034-000000259034-SvnUpdate.post wc.db smartsvn.properties and validating with SmartSVN smartsvn.properties without validating with SmartSVN format entries pristine folder temp folder 3 - I changed a single file and then updated it recursively then tried committing it. Still got the out of date error. 4 - Updating the same file non-recursively then committed it. Still got out of date error. 5 - Saved a text file in the top level of the directory outside of the android project folders that says “hi” on the inside. Added to the repository, committed, opened it and made a change so it read “hello world”, committed, and it works. 6 - Removed the text file from the svn, moved it to a file inside of the android project, added to svn, committed, get out of date error 7 - The .svn folder is not in the bin folder of the Android project, so I don't think the bin folder is causing a problem like it can sometimes do with repositories.

Possible duplicate of Google App Engine JDO enhancement is failing. This is my first app engine app which I'm implementing based on "appengine-java-sdk-1.8.8" and Intellij Idea 13.0. Following image shows my application. I have designed my application based on tutorial on Intellij Idea page. In web.xml file if I clear lines 8-18 and remove mobilesoft.asia package from src folder then application works fine and when I click on Run button then I can see my "Hello world" message that I have written on index.jsp file. However, with having of my package and lines 8-18 in web.xml then exception happens when I click on Run button. Any suggestion would be appreciated. ============== Edit: I downloaded 'datanucleus-appengine-2.0.0-final-dist' via this page. Seems it is latest release. Then I compared with what items I found under appengine-java-sdk-1.8.8\lib\opt\tools\datanucleus\v2 and realized that seems appengine has newer version of datanucleus. Therefore, app engine shouldn't have problem with compile, I'm confused....

Situation: I have implemented the code suggested in Android execute code on variable change brief summary of above answer: A class (IntStoreValue) that stores an int and a listener, and proposes an interface for listening to changes in this int && A custom UI item (in this case a TextView) that implements the above interface and applies setText() when this int is changed. I implemented this solution by setting this custom textview to listen to a public IntStoreValue constantly modified in my GLSurfaceView renderer class. This causes a view.ViewRootImpl$CalledFromWrongThreadException. (trying to access UI from outside UI thread)... This I can live with / understand... What I don't understand, is why I am able to make this solution work with a custom SeekBar / ProgressBar using setProgress(int newValue) in the onIntChanged interface method...? I used this "loophole" to make a normal TextView setText() onProgressChanged of my custom seekBar... Why does this work with these widget.Bar items and not with TextViews? I don't mind using this "SeekBar pass-through" loophole, but I would like to know why I cannot directly use the TV solution... Thanks!

Deployment now does not work on any of my projects. I recently updated the plugin and there was a message that it required java 1.7. Development was working as usual after that message and I had no problems until I tried to deploy. (When I change the java compatibility on the project I get an error that GAE required 1.7.) This may be related to the problem I'm having with java. According to mac preferences, java 1.7 is installed yet when I start a terminal session and issue the java command to check the version, it indicated 1.6. eclipse also seems to be running on 1.6 and I can't figure out how to rectify this. It may or may not be related. My question is: can I fix this problem in place or do I have to back out updates and reinstall? I can continue to develop but am unable to deploy until I have a solution. Thanks in advance. Thanks to Rajeev, I have a lead but the problem is not fixed yet. So I find the keplar eclipse.ini file. There is no -vm entry. It has the following contents: /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines is 1.6.0.jdk. I assume that this is where eclipse is picking up the jvm. So I find and add an entry in the .ini file following the pattern in eclipse wiki: I get the following Alert: Then I go to the Mac Java Preferences which says that java is 1.7 is installed under: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin/Contents/Home/bin/java This is where java gets installed when you go to java.com to install. Then I get: So this is like an adventure game, but not as much fun. I see that I have to update the .ini file, but where or how do I get the right java?
I am trying to setup Android Studio on my Mac. It is running OSX 10.9.1 Mavericks. I have installed the latest JDK (at the time of writing 1.7 update 45), and I installed Android Studio. I use Java 7 because I have some Java applications I have to run and they require 1.7. I have not installed Java 1.6, because it is ancient and old. Launching Android Studio from any launcher does literally nothing. Activity Manager never shows it running. I do not want to install Java 1.6. I did some work and tried to run the executable via command line through the package contents, and for both executables, I get these messages: I am unsure what I am supposed to do to fix this error. I'm not very adept on a Mac (still somewhat new to it, and its confusing to do power user stuff on this) so if anyone can help me figure it out that'd be great. I'm on the 2013 Macbook Air with plenty of resources for this to run. Update: This also applies to Yosemite, El Capitan, and all the other versions of OSX that can run Android Studio.

I have a project using spring MVC. The request is recieved correctly. The dispatcher servlet correctly maps the request to the controller. The controller correctly processes the request and generates the proper response The model-map is populated and the correct view is returned At this point spring magic kicks in and I lose track of the specifics of what's going on. On the client-side, the response (via firebug) is a 500 error and nothing else. Without firebug my client just hangs. I have no idea how I can debug the dispatcher servlet, and figure out what the problem is. I can't step through the spring binaries with a debugger, and it's not throwing any sort of exception so I can't look at a stack trace. All I have to look at are configuration files which, i'm almost 100% certain are fine. What steps can I take to debug this problem? What tools or approaches can I use? Details: I'm using Eclipse IDE, Java EE 7 and an ant script to build the project. I'm deploying to tomcat 7.
This is on Ubuntu 12.04/ Java 7, 64bit Working on project to create java bindings for WebkitGtk Version 2. My primary interest in WebkitGTK is DOM access and manipulation as against just displaying web pages. For V2, WebkitGtk team changed architecture which allows DOM access via extensions. Extensions are loaded by WebKitWebProcess which is a separate process fired when webkit is started. I got most of it under control. My extension is getting loaded and JVM is started and my java classes are getting loaded and mostly working as expected. Right now my debugging technique is basically println statements and/or log statements. Wondering if I can attach a java debugger so that I can debug java code more easily. If I run jps command, PID of WebKitWebProcess does show up. So someone is aware that this process has JVM. Preferred debugger will be eclipse. Basically it boils down to how to attach java debugger where VM is stared using JNI_CreateJavaVM and process is already running.
I'm trying to take a slightly stricter approach to coding this class. Instead of my usual cowboy coding style, creating as I go, I'd like to first lay out the methods, the variables, the comments... all that jazz. So now here is the concept of the exception. Should I think "What are all the things that could possibly go wrong in this function?" and throw an exception for each (if existing ones aren't descriptive enough then create a new one)? It seems this is the most precise option. Should the line of thinking be "These are things that will probably go wrong, I'll throw a general exception for everything else." How about "Nothing will probably go wrong, I don't need to throw an exception, worse case I can throw a runtime exception in the off chance something does go wrong..." What I'm worried about here is the performance of the error handing. Ideally I could imagine Java just converting those exceptions into nice little if statements or some sort of jump statement. I imagine this could only cost one operation or so. I can also imagine Java creating a circus 20 calls deep for the sake of abstraction, maybe then they are costly and I should pretend I'm coding in C all over again? I wrote the question in a silly way since its more fun for both of us that way, but its a serious question. I'm sure there is some balance, maybe a rule of thumb or ten. How do you think about exceptions? Edit: I'm not suggesting I use exceptions for processing. What I am talking about is the number and preciseness of the exceptions (How specific an error, perhaps?).
I am using tomcat 6 and Java 1.5. In our application we have 2 scenario 1) Disable cache memory and use DB for data 2) Enable cache memory option and load DB data in in-memory cache when I am using 1st option my tomcat is starting up withing minute and application is working fine. To use second option i need to increase my heap memory. I am following below steps to increase my jvm heap size: http://viralpatel.net/blogs/setting-tomcat-heap-size-jvm-heap-eclipse/ I set -Xms512m and -Xms1024m as heap size. My application was working fine with these settings previously. But surprisingly from yesterday I am getting below error while tomcat startup when i am using cache enable option: kgefec: fatal error 0 kgepop: no error frame to pop to for error 21503 If I used 1st option i.e. cache disable I am not getting any error. The Data in DB remain same its not increased. I tried following options but did not get any success: 1) uninstall JAVA and re-install 2) downloaded another tomcat and configured that Please help me. Thanks in advance.
I've just downloaded Maven 3.1.1, placed it under the Spring STS 'springsource' folder then through the STS I created a new Spring MVC project, but I get a lot of errors in this new (almost empty) project pom.xml file, so I right clicked on pom.xml, selected Run As > Maven Clean then Run As > Maven install, but I always get the BUILD FAILURE message as follows: Failed to execute goal on project myapp: Could not resolve dependencies for project com.testing.myapp:war:1.0.0-BUILD-SNAPSHOT: The following artifacts could not be resolved: org.springframework:spring-context-jar:3.1.1.RELEASE, org.springframework:spring-aop:3.1.1.RELEASE...... After searching the web, I found resources pointing that this problem is due to firewall configuration, but I am 100% sure that I am not behind any firewall, so can someone please guide me and tell me what I am missing here? My OS is Mac OS 10.8 and I am using STS 3.4.0 The sample application I've build I didn't add any code to it, it was simple Spring MVC application which I've created using STS wizard. NOTE: When I try to compile pom.xml from command line using the command ( mvn compile ) it works normally Thanks for your time
in my Model project (it only has the persistent classes, aka java beans) i have a class which has a composite primary key. To map this, i have used two @Id in my class. Before hibernate 4 it was not possible but now it is Ok. So, the problem is, eclipse is showing an error in this class, saying that it should be done in the old way. Like this: As i said, it is a false error, because the code works fine if i execute it. I have JBoss Tools plugin installed on eclipse, but i don't know if the errors is being caused by it or by eclipse. Anyone know how to solve this issue? Not that it is preventing me from executing the app, but it is an annoying thing to have the error being always shown. --- EDIT --- So, now i know the problem is on JBoss Tools because i deactivated the JPA facet on the project and the error have stopped. But i wish i could use the facilities that JBoss Tools gives, so... no solution yet.
so, I've written programs using ifstream in the past, successfully. yet this time, I can't seem to correct this "cannot read characters from string" error shown in the image. I basically declare ifstream inputFileStream in the class header, then try stating inputFileStream("text.txt"); and I already have that given error in the debugger. More specifically, I construct an instance of the given class in the main method, and call (from the main method,) the public method which contains the statement inputFileStream("text.txt");. I've made sure that the given text file is actually in the same folder as the project. Anybody familiar with this error? I looked up the cccccccc error code and it has to do with an uninitialized stack something, but why would that be relevant to this? The closest post to this was here, but im still trying to decipher the problem How to end up with a pointer to 0xCCCCCCCC
I have restarted a project that i closed after it became too comfusing, the original project was a webserver run entirely from java code. I have started this back up in the hopes of making the code 100% my own using java. I have gotten to the testing stage of hosting website however whenever i try to connect from the outside world i am shutdown with an error page. I have note coded this error page and after extensive research it is viewable that the error page is originating from apache. The only problem with this is that there is no apache in the code or in the virtualbox server. I have also tested this on two different virtual servers: opensuse 13.1 and fedora 20. The URL of the server is blends.hopto.org/beta. There should be a black background there with some arrows and a blue dot, but instead there is an error that states: "Not Found The requested URL /beta was not found on this server. Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encounted while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request." I do not get this error if i request the page from inside my local network. But i do from outside, it is not a port forwarding problem because my minecraft server works and the server is assigned to the public ip of my home router! Thanks, any help is appreciated! Extra info: After positing this question i stumbled across some other problems and it seems that the error is originating from SELinux, however i have disabled SELinux and the error is still coming through!
I've installed WAMP's mysql server and created the database named getataxi. When I go to phpMyAdmin i can see the database and its tables. I also connected to this database through JDBC. When i create a connection to the database using : conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS); I get this error : com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown database 'getataxi' at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(Unknown Source) at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Unknown Source) at com.mysql.jdbc.Util.handleNewInstance(Util.java:411) what could be the problem ? Note : My wamp server is online . I tried to connect to a test database that comes with the software, it seems it can find the test database because i get different error message saying the table in database is not found and its true . I tried building getataxi with uppercase letters and lower case but didnt help . I had a *.sql file that contained the tables that i imported . DB_URL is jdbc:mysql://localhost/getataxi i also tried jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/getataxi Mysql USER is root I am using Windows
I am having trouble setting up the build path of my java project. I am currently in a Co-Op IT position so I am somewhat new to all this. My background is mostly in C++ and I am learning java on the fly. I am also somewhat new to Eclipse (Kepler service release 1). I am working on a bug on an existing program and need to get the program to build so I can work on it. When I add all of the external .jar files that I know for a fact are the right ones, I am getting this error on two of them : "Archive for required library: '(location of file)' cannot be read or is not a valid ZIP file" Two of the other full time guys on my team have gotten the program to run with those exact same .jar files, one running Eclipse Indigo and the other running the same Kepler version as myself. I also was able to open the two .jar files manually and everything appears to be there. After every trial trying to fix this, I have refreshed, cleaned and restarted eclipse. The two other full time guys said they have never seen this error. I would like to get some insight on this from anyone who has any similar experiences so that I don't have to use up much more of their time.
I am a relative newcomer to the world of Java enterprise development. My organization's Java guru is out on indefinite family leave, and I have been assigned the task of maintaining some of the Java applications he developed. He setup Eclipse [Kepler SR1] with Maven on my computer before he left, and it appeared to work ok. Now I'm ready to deploy my first modification and need to run a Maven install, but I am having trouble getting it to work - I get the following output on my console: [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.1:compile (default-compile) on project mrpapp: Compilation failure [ERROR] No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK? but I definitely am running a JDK and not a JRE. I double-checked my $JAVA_HOME (C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_60) and it does have a javac.exe in its bin directory. I am attaching a copy of my pom.xml file for your review. I'm sure there is something in there that is causing the problem, but I am not sure what it might be. I am using a laptop with Windows 7 64bit, if you need any further platform/environment info I can supply that as well. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
I will do my best to explain the exact situation we ran into. Let me know if you guys have additional questions. I do not know if this is a java linking issue or a java loading issue. I have compiled the code using a external jar file which has changed during the execution. I am referencing a class file called "Contract" in my code. The library which I am using at compile time has a "Contract" class which extends from the "BaseContract" class. But the library which I am using at execution time does not have a super class ("BaseContract"). At runtime, I get a a error saying BaseContract class is not found. The class referencing the "Contract" class, lets say, is called "AppClass". At compile time, does java store the class hierarchy of all its referenced classes in the class file which is being compiled. In my specific example, does java store the class hierarchy of the "Contract" class in the AppClass.class file? If so, why does java have to store the class hierarchy here. Is it not more efficient to store the class "Contract" hierarchy in the Contract.class file rather than in the AppClass.class file? Any help or pointers are greatly appreciated.

I am using Eclipse 3.5 along with JDK 1.6.0_23 (both on Laptop and desktop) within my organisation. The proxy server uses Windows domain authentication to pass through request. While adding update sites within Eclipse available on Laptop, I could see that Eclipse is able to connect the site and doesn't throw authorisation exception. I have set the Active Provider in Network Connections as Native. I haven't configured my credentials in eclipse anywhere and it communicates with Proxy server smoothly. I have similar settings on my desktop machine, but it throws Proxy Authorization exception. There is no clue in Error log. But it does displays a information indicating System property http.proxyHost is not set but should be XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX. Similar messages do appear for http.proxyPort and https as well. I don't want to explicitly enter my credentials in Eclipse and hence looking for clues as why similar settings are behaving differently in these environments.
This question is a possible duplicate of this and this thread. But since none of them have provided a clear solution for my problem, I'm asking it again. My required task is to connect 2 Keyboards via USB and then manage the inputs of each Keyboard separately through a Java Application. This requirement has been answered into some progress in the first thread I have mentioned above by @nan but his solution did not work accurately for me. You can find his blog post on his solution for this here. He has done the solution using the java-hid-api and it seems accurate and working. However the point I am stuck in it is at opening the HID Device. When I try to open the Device using the HIDManager using either the openByPath() or the openById() methods it returns only null and therefore it throws the NullPointerException. it is the same when I try it using the open() method of HIDDeviceInfo. this issue is listed in the java-hid-api page too but so far no one seems to have provided a working solution. The OS I'm working on is Windows 7 32-bit Here are all the 3 attempts I've made to open the HID Device HIDDevice hidDevice = HIDManager.getInstance().openByPath(hidDeviceInfo.getPath()); HIDDevice hidDevice = HIDManager.getInstance().openById(hidDeviceInfo.getVendor_id(), hidDeviceInfo.getProduct_id(), hidDeviceInfo.getSerial_number()); HIDDevice hidDevice = hidDeviceInfo.open(); Has anyone been able to get through this problem? If so your help is highly appreciated. Thank you! Update 1: I just found out that this task could be accomplished with JInput, according to the answer provided by @paul-whelan in this thread. I am going to try it now but I'm stating here first seeking for any confirmation or a guide on how to do it if anyone already knows and have accomplished it.
I am new to Android programming and Google App Engine. I followed the below documentation to run a sample app which registers my device: https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/endpoints-androidconnected-gae When I run the app(on a device), I see the following: 1)Registration with Google Cloud Messaging...SUCCEEDED! 2)Registration with Endpoints Server...FAILED! Unable to register your device with your cloud endpoints server. Either your cloud endpoints server is not deployed to app engine, or your settings need to be changed to run against a local instance by setting LOCAL_ANDROID_RUN to 'true' in CloudEndpointUtils.java I also checked the LogCat and see the following exception: 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): Exception received when attempting to register with server 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): java.net.SocketTimeoutException: failed to connect to /10.0.2.2 (port 8888) after 20000ms 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.io.IoBridge.connectErrno(IoBridge.java:159) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.io.IoBridge.connect(IoBridge.java:112) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connect(PlainSocketImpl.java:192) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connect(PlainSocketImpl.java:459) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at java.net.Socket.connect(Socket.java:872) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpConnection.(HttpConnection.java:76) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpConnection.(HttpConnection.java:50) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpConnection$Address.connect(HttpConnection.java:340) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpConnectionPool.get(HttpConnectionPool.java:87) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpConnection.connect(HttpConnection.java:128) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpEngine.openSocketConnection(HttpEngine.java:316) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpEngine.connect(HttpEngine.java:311) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpEngine.sendSocketRequest(HttpEngine.java:290) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpEngine.sendRequest(HttpEngine.java:240) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpURLConnectionImpl.connect(HttpURLConnectionImpl.java:81) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at libcore.net.http.HttpURLConnectionImpl.getOutputStream(HttpURLConnectionImpl.java:197) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at com.google.api.client.http.javanet.NetHttpRequest.execute(NetHttpRequest.java:77) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at com.google.api.client.http.HttpRequest.execute(HttpRequest.java:964) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at com.google.api.client.googleapis.services.AbstractGoogleClientRequest.executeUnparsed(AbstractGoogleClientRequest.java:410) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at com.google.api.client.googleapis.services.AbstractGoogleClientRequest.executeUnparsed(AbstractGoogleClientRequest.java:343) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at com.google.api.client.googleapis.services.AbstractGoogleClientRequest.execute(AbstractGoogleClientRequest.java:460) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService.onRegistered(GCMIntentService.java:163) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at com.google.android.gcm.GCMBaseIntentService.handleRegistration(GCMBaseIntentService.java:251) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at com.google.android.gcm.GCMBaseIntentService.onHandleIntent(GCMBaseIntentService.java:153) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at android.app.IntentService$ServiceHandler.handleMessage(IntentService.java:65) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:158) 01-14 06:05:40.268: E/com.googlecloudproject.GCMIntentService(1831): at android.os.HandlerThread.run(HandlerThread.java:61) Can anyone suggest on when this exception occurs and why my device is not able to register with cloud end points?
I read all previous threads related to this matter but I could not solve my problem. Hence I post it here. My application has a text to pdf converter and I used iText for it. When I tried to install the application to the device the console says, Installation error: INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES. Please check logcat output for more details. Launch canceled! In logcat it says, 01-15 14:30:09.019: E/PackageParser(2454): Package com.example.example has no certificates at entry res/layout/activity_main.xml; ignoring! I'm using JDK 1.6 and android Android 4.4. I uninstalled previous .apk and clean and build the project. EDIT: As a solution for this problem, I tried to sing the application using eclipse. But after gave the keystore and alias it is gave error as "duplicate files at the same path inside the apk". I checked my lib folder if there is any duplicate jars and cleaned and rebuilt it. But still I cannot export signed apk. As far as I can understand issues for above both cases that jars may be has file same as in my application. But I don't know hot to solve this. Any suggestion would be welcome to get rid of this problem.
I'm unable to debug applet when it is in the WAR file. I use Eclipse IDE and Win8. My java version is 7 15. I'm going to list my steps and maybe there is something that I do wrong: 1) First of all, I go to "Control panel->Programs->Java", then on "Java" tab I select "View". New window opens. 2) Then I enter the following line into "Runtime parameters": (without quotes) "-Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=1888,suspend=n", then I click "OK", "OK". 3) In Eclipse IDE I build war file. 4) Then I navigate to "Servers" tab, right click on my tomcat server and select "Debug". Now I can reach my project on my browser using this address: "localhost:8080/myProjectName". 5) On Eclipse IDE I go to "Run->Debug Configurations...->", then I select "Remote JAVA application" tab. Let's say there are no elements on that tab, so I right click on "Remote JAVA application" and select "New". 6) I set connection type to "Standart (Socket Attach)" and then I set "port" to 1888 and host to "localhost", then I click apply. 7) After clicking apply I do not close that window and I click "Debug". Window closes and IDE spits out error window "Problem occured. 'Launching myProjectName(1)' has encountered a problem. Failed to connect to remote VM. Connection refused." --- Additional info --- I use java server pages on this project too and then I set JPDA_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n in catalina.bat file and run server from command line by typing catalina.bat jpda start I'm able to debug java beans, but not the applets. This is because beans are running on the server side and the applet runs on the user side.

We have developed a java application, whose primary objective is to read a file(input file), process it and convert it into set of output files. (I have given a generic description of our solution, to avoid irrelevant details). This program works perfectly fine when the input file is of 4 GB, with memory settings of -Xms4096m -Xmx16384m in a 32 GB RAM Now we need to run our application with the input file of size 130 GB. We used a linux box with 250GB RAM and with memory setting of -Xms40g -Xmx200g (also tried couple of other variations) to run the application and hit OutOfMemory Exception. At this stage of our project it's very hard to consider redesigning the code to accommodate hadoop ( or someother large scale data processing framework), also the current hardware configuration which we can afford is 250GB of RAM. Can you please suggest us ways to avoid OutOfMemory Exceptions, what is the general practise when developing these kind of applications.? Thanks in advance

I am developing an program that uses transactions, for data integrity. I have read about jdbc savepoints where one can rollback to a point where there was no error in the transaction. But there is one situation, say the network fails, that makes the connection handling the transaction to be invalid. Now i have managed to detect in my program whenever a network problem occurs, make appear a dialog that will block the ui for 2 minutes while trying to establish a connection to the db. my question is, is there a way to save a transaction, not a savepoint, or re establish the connection where a network failure occured in during the transaction, so that if connection is re established, we can continue with the prevous queries? why i want this is because my program will perform transactions over multiple modal dialogs before commit, say dialog A queries were successfull, when we go to dialog B before committing, if a network error occurs here we should be able to continue where we left off in dialog A. Thanks in advance.
After running my App in Tomcat many times, I've maxed out the PermGen memory (a problem with my quartz servlet, I suspect) and Java threw a OutOfMemoryError. Normally, I just restart tomcat from time to time, but since this happened I'm unable to start/restart. Tomcat is running in our qa environment and is normally started/stoped/restarted via the sbin folder. I've tried to start tomcat using the alternative, catalina.sh run, but it says the port is being used! That led me to suspect that tomcat was already running, but when I try to stop it, I get this error: SEVERE: Could not contact localhost:8005. Tomcat may not be running. Jan 19, 2014 3:10:58 PM org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stopServer SEVERE: Catalina.stop: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method) at java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.doConnect(AbstractPlainSocketImpl.java:339) at java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.connectToAddress(AbstractPlainSocketImpl.java:200) at java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.connect(AbstractPlainSocketImpl.java:182) at java.net.SocksSocketImpl.connect(SocksSocketImpl.java:392) at java.net.Socket.connect(Socket.java:579) ... So, if it's not started or stopped, then what state is tomcat in?! How can I bring it back to a startable state? Update As per Boris's comment, I've used ps auxfww to list processes and the only one with tomcat as the user is the following: tomcat 5111 8.0 29.0 2052336 556512 ?

I have few doubts regarding generics wildcard concepts. 1.Let say i have a method: void write(List<?> list) and i call this with a List<Dog> list,write(list) and trying to add in write() like list.add(new Dog()) is a compilation error, why? My understanding is mean an unknown type and can accept any type, so if i call with a type Dog then it should allow to add into the list a Dog... What i infer wrong here? 2.Now, if i use bounded wild cards, write(List<? super Dog> list> it solves the above problem, why? and this allows me to add an Dog to the list But as per understanding about ?super Dog... it should allow Dog and super's of Dog.... so i should be able to add an Animal also to the list? But getting an compilation error. I think this problem is because write(List<? super Dog> list> allows only me to call write() with a list of either or super's of Dog and once you called it with a type... you can only add to the list that type only, Am I correct? Thanks in Advance..
I have a neo4j database with several million nodes and about as many relationships. While running a program that was adding data to it, the JVM seems to have crashed. When I later tried to query the database using an index, it opened normally and retrieved some of the nodes, but at some point returned the following error: Exception in thread "main" org.neo4j.graphdb.NotFoundException: Node[20924] not found. This can be because someone else deleted this entity while we were trying to read properties from it, or because of concurrent modification of other properties on this entity.

And though the exception claims that it's temporary, this happens every time I try to query this index. I therefore assume it has to do with the bad shutdown. I have had database corruptions before from forced shutdowns before I implemented code to prevent that, but neo4j was always able to recover the database, though it took a while. It seems that this is much worse. When I looped through the index manually and added a try-catch, it began returning the error for every node in the index after the one listed above. Does that mean that all these nodes are non-existent, or corrupted? That would mean a significant (huge) loss of data, since there should be about a million nodes in the index. What can I do to recover the database? I am using 1.9.2 and would love to upgrade to use labels and etc., but I need this database right now for some time-critical work and don't have time to change anything major right now. Thanks a lot in advance for any help.
I am new to Stack Exchange and this is my first question so please forgive me if I do not ask this question conforming to the normal standards of this website. If you have any tips that will help me become a more efficient member please feel free to let me know. First off, I am having a problem with my Java plugin in Firefox. Under tools, add-ons, I have listed for my Java plugin, "Java(TM) Plug-in 10.51.2 10.51.2". I recently installed some updates and apparently the new version of Java automatically blocks un-signed applets from being able to run even if you attempt to allow it manually by clicking on the "Allow Now" option that is displayed in the URL bar. This is unacceptable as I am currently trying to test software and I need to be able to run the applet. So to get back to the question, how can I remove that specific Java plugin (Java(TM) Plug-in 10.51.2 10.51.2) and install the icedtea-7-plugin for Firefox to use in its place. I have installed the icedtea-7-plugin via terminal through the "sudo apt-get install icedtea-7-plugin" command with success but how can I get Firefox to use this plugin and disregard the plugin that is currently listed under the add-ons option in my browser. Any help will be greatly appreciated as this is a frustrating matter. Thank you very much! -Dave EDIT: It is important to note the reason that the OP was asking about allowing unsigned applets was that he is developing on one. This question is therefore on topic as it is about a tool used for software development.
I'm using Jersey to develop my REST Web Service. I'm trying to implement validations, and for that I used the excellent integrations with JSR-303 Bean Validation Jersey offers. I then define an ExceptionMapper to output what I want from the occurred errors. The problem is that sometimes, exceptions happen not in the context of the Bean Validation. Example: a client sends an invalid value for a float (e.g. "ABC"). Jackson throws an exception because it can't parse the given JSON to a float value. This is expected. I could write an ExceptionMapper for this exception and output it to the client. However, what I would want would be to gather all these different exceptions coming from various sources, and output them all. In other words, I would like to output the errors that happened during parsing and from Bean Validation in the same response, not individually. Is there any way to keep collecting all the exceptions and in the end output them all? The first problem I'm assuming will happen is that Bean Validation will never occur until Jackson parses the request correctly.
I am using several different schemas in my project. They are each compiled into a separate jar, each using a separate package, using the xmlbeans ant task. I can only seem to successfully parse xml (using the .Factory.parse(String xml) method) for the schema jar that is first in the classpath, otherwise I get a ClassCastException as described in this bug. If I change the jar ordering, a different schema will be able to parse successfully, and the ClassCastException will be thrown for a different class. I've done some debugging, and I'm coming to the conclusion that the structure of the schemaorg_apache_xmlbeans.namespace package is probably responsible. Since my schemas do not have namespaces, each of jars I've built share some files that are identically named in identical packages. Specifically, I've seen that each jar has a schemaorg_apache_xmlbeans.namespace._nons.xmlns.xsb file that seems to point to the actual schema for that jar. If the factory uses this file to determine some of the classes it will use to parse the xml it has, this may explain the ClassCastException, as it's only looking at the first file on the classpath and not the correct one for the XML it has. Whether there is any option to specify the namespaces for the schemas generated (like java namespaces) in the wsdls or xsds or in the ant task "wsdl to java" compilation?
I am new to JAX-RS and still learning it, so my question can be a little naive so please bear with it :) I have been going through various SO questions for "error codes for http response" . I have found out that as long as one dont want to be pedantic he can return 4xx status codes in the response. I have also gone through this link RFS 2616 also the W3 I wanted to know is there any general practice to return custom error codes other than standard HTTP response status codes. e.g if in post request for getting user information by userid and return error if userid is invalid / doesnt exists. In this case HTTP status 422 sounds idle. But if detailed error description is needed can custom error like 40xx where xx is value other than http errors be returned to client. similarly can 40xx be defined and returned in response to client ? ( having correct syntax in the request ) 4001 - userid invalid 4002 - post id invalid etc.. or should I return 4xx status code and in the response body add by own codes for more error details?
I'm trying to execute a function dynamically using JEXL 2.1.1 and a Script. The function is defined by me and it throws a custom error. It seems like JEXL catches the exception, but does not propagate it, only shows it. I really need to know when the exception occurs, because it is a critical error and I want my program to exit. I tried setting the silent mode to false. I understand that in this mode, JEXL should throw a JEXLException, but it is not in my case. I also understand from JEXL website that: The JexlException are thrown in "non-silent" mode but since these are RuntimeException, user-code should catch them wherever most appropriate I checked and no RuntimeException is thrown. JEXL only logs the error and (in my case) returns false (the method returns a boolean). How can I force JEXL to throw an error (my error or JEXLException, it doesn't matter)?
I've recently begun to use Maven for dependency management and structure for my Java EE 6 applications. I'm a relative newcomer, but have successfully managed to create projects for a Java EE 6 EAR with WAR, 2x EJB, and utility modules and am able to deploy it to JBoss EAP 6.2 with no problem. One area I am finding rather difficult is in JSF development. Previously, when I would create an EAR/WAR project in Eclipse, it was very simple to deploy the app, make changes to the *.xhtml files, publish the changes, and see them reflected immediately just by hitting the Refresh button on my browser. This made it easy to test content layouts, etc. on my JSF pages. With Maven, however, I find myself having to do a Maven 'install' to repackage my EAR and deploy it for every little change. Is there no way to have Eclipse/JBoss recognize the src/main/webapp folder from my Maven project and use that for the JSF path so I can do development and debugging easier? For the record, I am using JBoss EAP 6.2 as my app server, and Eclipse Kepler for my IDE with JBoss Tools installed. I have not added any other Maven or JBoss plugins beyond that.

I had this question on a homework assignment (don't worry, already done): [Using your favorite imperative language, give an example of each of ...] An error that the compiler can neither catch nor easily generate code to catch (this should be a violation of the language definition, not just a program bug) From "Programming Language Pragmatics" (3rd ed) Michael L. Scott My answer, call main from main by passing in the same arguments (in C and Java), inspired by this. But I personally felt like that would just be a semantic error. To me this question's asking how to producing an error that is neither syntactic nor semantic, and frankly, I can't really think of situation where it wouldn't fall in either. Would it be code that is susceptible to exploitation, like buffer overflows (and maybe other exploitation I've never heard about)? Some sort of pit fall from the structure of the language (IDK, but lazy evaluation/weak type checking)? I'd like a simple example in Java/C++/C, but other examples are welcome.

I am working on a Java Web Application based on Java 6/Tomcat 6.0. It's a web based document management system. The customers may upload any kind of file to that web application. After uploading a file a new Thread is spawned, in which the uploaded file is analyzed. The analysis is done using a third party library. This third-party-libraries works fine in about 90% of the analyze-jobs, but sometimes (depending on the uploaded file) the logic starts to use all remaining memory, leading to an OutOfMemoryError. As the whole application is running in a single JVM, the OoM-Error is not only affecting the analyze-jobs, but has also impact on other features. In the worst case scenario, the application crashes completely or remains in an inconsistent state. I am now looking for a rather quick (but safe) way to handle those OoM-Errors. Replacing the library currently is no option (that's why I have neither mentioned the name of the library, nor what kind of analysis is done). Does anybody have an idea of what could be done to work around this error? I've been thinking about launching a new process (java.lang.ProcessBuilder) to have a new JVM. If the third-party-lib causes an OoM-Error there, it would not have effects on the web application. On the other hand, this would cause additional effort to synchronize the new Process with the Analysis-Part of the web application. Does anybody have any experience with such a system (especially with regards to the stability of the system)? Some more information: 1) The analysis part can be summarized as a kind of text extraction. The module receives a file reference as input and writes the analysis result into a text file. The resulting text-file is further processed within the web applications business logic. Currently the workflow is synchronous. The business logics waits for the third-party-lib to complete its job. There is no queuing or other asynchronous approach. 2) I am quite sure that the third-party-library causes the OoM-Error. I've tested the analysis part in isolation with different files of different sizes. The file that causes the OoM-Error is quite small (about 4MB). I have done further tests with that particular file. While having a JVM with 256MB of heap, the analysis crashes due to the OoM-Error. The same test in a JVM with 512MB heap passes. However, increasing the heap size will only help for a short period of time, as a larger test file again causes the test to fail due to OoM-Error. 3) A Limit for the size of files being uploaded is in place; but of course you cannot have a limit of 4MB per file. Same is for the OS and architecture. The system has to work on both 32- and 64-bit systems (Windows and Linux)

yesterday i just tried to run my application on real mobile device, and it did. just that the application itself have coding error. but then when i open my other project, start eclipse today, there are manny errors. i forgot exactly which error appear when. .java.util.ConcurrentModificationException,No repository found at file, , Plug-in com.android.ide.eclipse.adt was unable to load class com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.ToolsLocator. An error occurred while automatically activating bundle com.android.ide.eclipse.adt (2), :/C:/Users/My%20Name/Downloads/. right now all my import the "android" becomes cannot be resolved. along with all my other object can't work. like LocationManager, button, onClickListener,String..com.google.android.gms.maps, setContentView, Bundle...and more.. i do not know what cause these error, my eclipse seems to be missing some files. i never download anything extra on eclipse before. i tried updating but it has nothing to update. should i uninstall and reinstall eclipse? i prefer to avoid that to save me working all over again but it seem there are no other choices? i uses eclipse for a long time that nothing like that happened before..
I am debugging my Android app by having it stop at a breakpoint. Indeed, execution stops at the breakpoint, but once I step over one step, then step into, the problems start: Instead of stepping into the function, the debugger seems to perform a step over, just highlighting the next line. When I then press step over, a message box pops up with one of the following messages: com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException: Got IOException from Virtual Machine occurred creating step request. or org.eclipse.jdi.TimeoutException: Timeout occurred while waiting for packet xxx occurred creating step request. This happens whenever I perform the steps above (Always on the same breakpoint), which is preventing me from debugging my app. I am debugging on a real device, using Eclipse on Windows. I already tried: Restarting Eclipse Increasing the Debugging Timeout in Eclipse, which just leads to the first error to appear more often in comparison Now here are my questions: Has anyone else come across this problem? What could I do to solve the problem?
I have a program which will run into a very deep recursion while executing. In middle of this, I am getting java.lang.StackOverflowError and my application freezes. I am using JDK 1.6 and Windows 7 OS. Strange thing here is, I am not getting this StackOverflowError with same code base while running my application with Java 1.5 and Windows XP. I understood that default stack size will differ from platform to platform and OS to OS. But with Java 1.5 and Windows XP, I set stack size of 256k using -Xss command and not getting this error. With same 256k in Windows 7 OS and Java 1.6, I am getting this error. With stack size of 256k, my application is running without any issue in Windows XP and it's throwing a StackOverflowError in Windows 7 OS. So please give any information how thread stack sizes will differ from Windows 7 OS to Windows XP??
When trying to add/remove some stuff from/in a list in a loop java could raise ConcurrentModificationException exceptions. After searching in google I came across ways of overcoming the issue such as applying the interface iterator and when you want to remove an item you need to remove it from the list through the iterator itself using the remove() function. However, there isn't an add() function among the iterator's methods so the only way to add an element with no exception raised would be to use the loop for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) by using the index/position. However, this loop is extremely inefficient with large lists as you need to get the index position of the item in question by traversing all the way through the list. So my question is do you know any other way except the way I mentioned which you can use to add an item to a list? Thanks
First of all I apologize for being unable to share exact stack trace and code contents. There is an airgap between my development system and the internet and it is impossible to just copy paste. My issue is that the typeAlias for my DTO is causing a ClassNotFound exception when the mapper attempts to parse the config xml. The confusing part is that there is a very VERY similar DAO/DTO in the next package over that works fine. I mirrored all of their settings when I added the new one .. but the new one is wreaking havoc. Pseudo code setup: org.com.somesystem.common.database: spring-prod-db-coolDaoBeans.xml (containing config information and bean IDs that sort of thing) sql-map-config.xml (containing settings, typeAliases mapping resultTypes to DTO object names, Mappers) org.com.somesystem.common.database.cooltable: CoolTableDAO.java (interface with insert, delete, update, count, selectAll methods) CoolTableDTO.java (public class with setters and getters) CoolTable.DAO.xml (the sql definitions for inserts, selects, deletes etc on coolTable) This works great, I build a jar.. and call REST services that use the DAO/DTO without issue, then I add org.com.somesystem.common.database.muchcoolertable MuchCoolerTableDAO.java (interface with insert, delete, update, count, selectAll methods) MuchCoolerTableDTO.java (public class with setters and getters) MuchCoolerTable.DAO.xml (the sql definitions for inserts, selects, deletes etc on muchCoolerTable) I also make mirrored entries for the typeAlias' , mappers etc in the mapper and config files at the .database level. I have doulble checked the jar file created, MuchCoolerTableDTO.class is there with bells on but when I deploy it to the web server and start the web service up it blows up because it can't find the class defined in the typeAlias definition. I have had two colleages double check all of the code, there are no spaces or typos, everything for MuchCoolerTable classes is exactly like CoolTable. Has anyone seen this issue? ring any bells? I am banging my head against it for 3 days now.
We are using maven in combination with the maven-failsafe-plugin to run our integration tests. This works fine, but we notice that some more long running tests are started at the end. This is not optimal because all other tests are finished while this longer running tests still takes minutes to finish. It would be more efficient to start these long running tasks first. I notice that there is an runOrder option that can optimize this, but that uses analyses data from one test run that needs to be checked in. As we use git with a lot of branches this isn't really a good option. Also tests tend to run quite long when they are failing, when normally they are quite fast, so we are afraid these optimizations won't really work for us. What we are looking for is a way to just specify the exact order in which to run our tests. With that I mean the order of the test classes, not the methods. We have about 25 classes, so it would be totally doable just to list them in the optimal order when they should be picked up. Is there currently a way to achieve this?
This problem is now really frustrating me more than ever as I am fully dependent on the debugger to identify a difficult bug. This is my environment Web application written in Java Packaged and deployed as war file in Tomcat 7 and running in Windows IntelliJ 12, with remote debugging to Tomcat I have to navigate and set break points quite often in the code contained in the jar files of my web module (not part of the project). I checked out the needed source code of the jar files locally and "attached" the code, but I have the following problems Quite often, I cannot see the source code - I just see the method signature. This happens sometimes after a redeploy, but sometimes even otherwise. Even after several attempts to attach the source, I cannot see the source code Sometimes even if I see the source code(ie, attach was successful), the debugger behaves in a funny way, ie, it looks like even though the source I see is the right one, IntelliJ is running code through somewhere else. So I miss break points, sometimes goes through the wrong branch of an if-else etc. I tried invalidating the cache and restarted, but in vain. When I looked at the Intellij system cache, I was surprised to see several very old copies of the library and even several copies of the same snapshot of the same library, all in the cache. So invalidating cache doesn't seem to have any effect in getting rid of stale copies in the system cache. Can anyone else who had one or more of the problems that I have please shed some light on how they have solved these? Also what exactly happens when "Invalidate cache" is performed? Can I safely get rid of all the old jar files?
I'm trying to track down the source of an EOFException in some client/server code, but many of the classes used only have methods which say that they throw an IOException, not specifically an EOFException. Normally I'd just look at the stack trace but I don't have it and can't reproduce it. So, it would be helpful to have a list of every class which has methods which throw EOFException specifically, but I don't know how to find out this information. Is there a source of information on every (standard) Java class (in SE 7, in my case) which has methods which throw EOFException? I have tried reading the Javadocs on EOFException to no avail. (I have found, at least, that DataInput does mentionEOFException. But are there any more?) Afterword: Since it seems the only way to find out is to inspect the source code, here is the result of me searching for "EOFException" in the extracted source code (1.7.0_45).

Apologies in advance for the lengthy explanation. We have an large web application which uses a RabbitMQ server, a Tomcat webserver, a MySQL database, and a Hadoop environment. Most of the team uses Windows, and one uses Ubuntu, but we use CentOS for our deployment environment. We've recently started using vagrant and ansible to standardise environment configuration and deployment across multiple environments. This is part of a move to improve the quality of our application, and helps us to avoid failure between different environments. We have most of it working now, and over the last few days I've been looking into replicating (or maybe even improving) our current development process with regards to building, running, debugging, and hot-swapping minor code changes without restarting the application. Our existing setup uses embedded Jetty (within eclipse), and we can run Jetty in either Run or Debug mode. With this setup we can place breakpoints, navigate to a relevant page, and when the breakpoint activates we can step through the code, drop frames off the stack to run through a method again, and even make minor changes to the code (within the rules of JVM hotswapping). This is, of course, fantastically helpful for us. I want to replicate as much of this behaviour as possible except instead of an embedded jetty instance, I want to remote debug the tomcat instance on the virtual machine, but still be able to make changes to the code without needing to restart tomcat each time. I should probably point out at this point that I am aware of JRebel, but it has been deemed unfeasible for our team at this point in time. At this point in time I have managed to automatically sync (using vagrant); 'src/main/webapp/WEB-INF', 'target/classes' (compiled by eclipse), and 'target/lib' (created by the maven copy-dependencies plugin'. These are all synced to the correct place on the vm, so that tomcat believes it is an exploded war. I have correctly setup Tomcat so that it runs in debug mode, and I have connected to it with eclipse, and successfully entered debug mode by placing a breakpoint. Making any changes to one of the synced files causes tomcat to restart the application and use the new file. The only problems left are that I lose all my session data when I save a change to a file, and I have to wait for the re-deployment to complete and then repeat appropriate steps to get back to my breakpoint. This is obviously a big waste of time. So after that lengthy explanation, my questions are: Has anyone managed to achieve what I'm trying to do? Is what I'm trying to do even possible? If so does anyone have any tips to help me finish my configuration? Can I do hot class replacement without triggering a context reload? Any help would be greatly appreciated and sorry for the essay! :)
I browse to an html page with an applet tag. The applet tag refernces two signed jars. I receive two Security Warning dialogs indicating the revocation status cannot be checked, accept the risk, and click Run for both of them. The browser displays an error gif that says "Error: click for details. I click. The Application Error dialog says ClassNotFoundException and the name of the class, and displays three options. I click (1) Details and see the Java Console with the menu but no errors. I click (2) Ignore with no apparent effect. I click (3) reload and the applet loads and runs properly. I have the latest java security update. This happens in Chrome and FireFox. I've signed the certificate using a Certificate from my Acitve Directory Certificate Server, I added the site to my list of trusted sites, and the CA certificate to the list of CA certs in the Java Control panel. I'm glad it works in the end but would like to avoid having to click Reload each time. Can anyone suggest what I might do differently?
I've been asked to debug a problem in a large Android app. I was hoping someone here may know more about the Android rendering pipeline than I do. Question: What are the possible reasons why the Canvas supplied by Android might not actually paint anything? For example, are there any modes you can put it in to temporarily suspend paints? Symptoms: The app is responding correctly, but the first Activity that opens shows up blank. The entire application area is white, and the application's custom ActionBar is now showing up. The Views are laying out correctly (verified by using Dump View Hierarchy for UI Automator) The main thread is responsive (verified by logging a heartbeat) The onDraw methods are being invoked (verified by putting breakpoints in various onDraw methods) The Views themselves seem to be painting correctly (verified by asking the root view to draw itself to a Bitmap and then serializing it to disk). The difference here is that this is drawing to a Canvas I instantiated myself rather than the one supplied by Android. None of the views are outside the screen bounds or have layers attached. Other Activities paint correctly. The misbehaving Activity makes use of Fragments. The problem was observed on both Android 4.3 and 4.4, and on several different devices. All of the relevant views are visible (verified by traversing the View hierarchy and checking getVisibility()). I'm at a loss as to other things to check for. It looks as though everything is functioning correctly, except that anything that gets written to the Canvas is discarded. I would be delighted if anyone could offer any additional ideas for things to check for. Also, the problem is not reproducible in the debugger - I only know about it from beta bug reports, none of which have supplied working steps to reproduce. I will need to fix this using code inspection and occasional customer bug reports.
I have a little website that gets pic from a mysql DB (BLOB field) and then i print them on my webpages. With some classes i read the blob fields, i check the pics dimensions, if necessary i resize them and with a servlet i print the pics on my pages. In every pages i do it (read some blob fields, check the sizes, resize and print several pics). Each pics saved inside the DB is less then 200 kb. I read the blob field this way: 1)InputStream photo = record.getBinaryStream("blob_field_name"); 2) BufferedImage sourceImage = ImageIO.read(photo); 3) i resize the pics I get often this message on tomcat's LOG "Exception in thread "http-bio-12418-exec-26" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" I have my own virtual machine on a server that i rented, and i have 64 mb of heap space. If i check the heap i have this result (for the same page with the same pics): heapsize on my laptop 293404672 heapsize on the server 503316480 How can i know if i made mistakes in my code or if it is a server problems? Thank you
I fallowed the exact steps in [1] in order to setup multiple ActiveMQ brokers in the same server. When I start the second instance I always get the same error. One thing I noticed is configurations on both instances are same. for instance configurations like port s are same in both activemq.xml and jetty.xml. I even change the ports of the second instance so it won't get crashed with the first intance. But I get the same Exception. https://sbforge.org/display/BITMAG/Running+multiple+activemq+instances+on+the+same+server INFO | Apache ActiveMQ 5.9.0 (instance1, ID:udara-54224-1391513355578-0:1) is shutdown INFO | Closing org.apache.activemq.xbean.XBeanBrokerFactory$1@33e228bc: startup date [Tue Feb 04 06:29:14 EST 2014]; root of context hierarchy WARN | Exception thrown from LifecycleProcessor on context close java.lang.IllegalStateException: LifecycleProcessor not initialized - call 'refresh' before invoking lifecycle methods via the context: org.apache.activemq.xbean.XBeanBrokerFactory$1@33e228bc: startup date [Tue Feb 04 06:29:14 EST 2014]; root of context hierarchy at org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext.getLifecycleProcessor(AbstractApplicationContext.java:360) at org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext.doClose(AbstractApplicationContext.java:1057) at org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext.close(AbstractApplicationContext.java:1010) at org.apache.activemq.hooks.SpringContextHook.run(SpringContextHook.java:30) at org.apache.activemq.broker.BrokerService.stop(BrokerService.java:782) at org.apache.activemq.xbean.XBeanBrokerService.stop(XBeanBrokerService.java:122) at org.apache.activemq.broker.BrokerService.start(BrokerService.java:574) at org.apache.activemq.xbean.XBeanBrokerService.afterPropertiesSet(XBeanBrokerService.java:73) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597) at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.invokeCustomInitMethod(AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.java:1608)
I have a server with JRE 6 installed, i used to run an applet from the browser ok with no problems, then i updated to JRE 7, now the applet gives 4 warning windows and in the console it shows warnings of missing lines in the manifest file, but after accepting all warnings it worked ok. I wanted to lose the warnings, so i first tried to modify the manifest file thinking that will resolve it, but since modifying the manifest files, the manifest warnings in the console don't show but the 4 security prompts are still there. normally i self sign the jar, after searching for a while i find it is something about the certificate, it must have a valid certificate. i used a generated Keytool command from DIGICERT website to produce a certificate file and a jks file, i tried to add the certificate through the java control panel and it asks for the keystore password, but whenever i enter the password that i used while creating the certificate, it gives wrong password. After searching for sometime i read suggestion of adding the certificate to either windows certificates or the internet explorer certificates then export it, but when i try to add the certificate to any of them it says unrecognized file. i imported the certificate to cacerts which i read is the java trusted key store, but still the applet produces 4 security prompts before running. i removed one of the security prompts by hiding the mixed code warning from the java control panel. but still there are 3 warnings. i have been trying for sometime, so any suggestions or explanation so that i can understand better ?
I am new to java programming and I have created a program which integrates selenium, apachepoi and java swing. While compiling the program I was able to compile it successfully and the program does run right; however when I tried making a jar file for my program it shows java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/poi/ss/usermodel/Row error. Below is my program's folder structure c:\users\userid\documents\java\crazyrunner The java file is with name CrazyRunner.java within crazyrunner folder The program is within a package with name crazyrunner (first line of the program starts with package crazyrunner) Command used to compile (not sure whether it is relevant) javac -encoding UTF8 crazyrunner\CrazyRunner.java Compilation resulted in creation of .class files in both parent (java) and child (crazyrunner) folders Command used to run java crazyrunner.CrazyRunner (This worked just fine) Command used generate the jar jar cvfm CrazyRunner.jar manifest.mf *.class crazyrunner\*.class The result of the jar command is successfull and all class files within crazyrunner and outside crazyrunner (within the parent folder 'Java') are added to the jar (CrazyRunner.jar) The manifest.mf file has data as below Manifest-Version: 1.0 Created-By: Eric Stanley Main-Class: crazyrunner.CrazyRunner Class-Path: "C:\poi-3.10-beta2\poi-3.10-beta2-20130904.jar" "C:\poi-3.10-beta2\poi-examples-3.10-beta2-20130904.jar" "C:\poi-3.10-beta2\poi-excelant-3.10-beta2-20130904.jar" .. Ends with 2 new lines Not sure about what am I missing :-( and I have spent a whole damn day fixing this and left without choice but to post this q!! and yes I did tried all options that stackoverflow already has and nothing worked out :-( Option 1: Open the Control Panel Go to System Go to Advanced Systems Properties Then Environment Variables In System Variables, click Add New Variable Name: _JAVA_OPTIONS New Variable Value: -Xmx512M (tried -Xmx1024M too) Click OK Option 2: Reinstall Java Option 3: Open the Run box Enter msconfig Services (tab) CHECK "Hide All Microsoft Services" Click "Disable All" (button) Click APPLY Click OK Option 4: Update manifest.txt file with classpath Help is much appreciated Note: The program opens up a GUI (while I enter java crazyrunner.CrazyRunner) and when I tried giving CrazyRunner.jar alone in the command prompt, it throws an error stating Java Virtual Machile Launcher. A java exception occurred PS: I am using Windows 8 and the version of java is 1.7.0_51 and I am not using any IDE and I do have a hunch that this might be due to too many jar files in the classpath. If yes, fix for that is badly needed!!
It is late on a Friday afternoon, and my web application has stopped responding to requests. The server is still reachable, and the Apache Tomcat process is not running–there are no errors in the logs. You want to go home but you can’t until it is fixed. What do you do? site will run after I restart the server Server admin told me that its " On further investigation, it came into our understanding that Tomcat application is unable to handle the large number for requests coming into the server at the peak business hours in your website or whenever there is a high traffic in the website. It's the reason the Tomcat service is getting hung up or crashed, then only solution is to restart it, so that Tomcat service running. so other time that said heap Size issue" But my website generate only maximum 250 persons each day. Please suggest me what will I do.
This question was dogging me for a few days until I found almost a full answer but I want to share the issue first: ISSUE I have a Windows 7 pro 64 bit laptop that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 (important later) I downloaded and installed the latest Java 7 u 51 jre / browser plugin and would always get a grey applet box before it would eventually redirect and say "failed to verify" if java was installed. I am also a java developer and had a few JDKs installed as well as jres. Thinking it was my environment I did a complete wipe of jave from my system (I ran JavaRa and made sure everything was removed http://singularlabs.com/software/javara/) I installed the 32 bit version of the JRE for the chrome plugin and made sure all the setting and security info was correct (per the many posts about this topic). After clearing all cache (browser and java), punching holes through my firewall (even disabling it to see if that would resolve it) as well as running things as administrator, verifying java was installed and running in all my browsers (it failed in IE, Chrome and FF) All of this was per many posts that said how to solve the issue of Java 7 not running in any browser. After enabling full trace and debugging with the Java console via the Java Control Panel I finally get some decent clues from the stack traces displayed in the console. It was failing to get resources from java or any site that had an applet or jnlp web start file.
We have built a web-service which as part of the validations, throws a number of errror messages to the calling application. The web-services which we built doesn't do any error handling\reporting and only returns the error message (the details would be available in the logs of course). We have come into issues where we are rejecting the input xmls with an error message, and the calling application is expecting us to report the errors as and when they occur. My question here is whose responsibility is it to report the errors? Until now I was thinking the calling platform should be reporting if their xmls gets rejected? Am I wrong in thinking so? If so, should I be writing all the rejections into my tables? This web-service along with others receive a huge number of requests daily. Please note that these are valid business errors thrown by the web-service, or errors due to incorrect xml's received
I am planning to have a table where there is a column that the user will be typing on (the user should enter a number) and everytime he types a number , it will be deducted on the column next to it, say: if I type 2, and the original number is 5, then the column should have 3. But I am having an error. So the first step i thought is to get the selected row.: this is my FULL exception: at java.awt.Container.processEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at

Suppose a view with a list of users and a link to another view that contains a form to add a new user to the list. You fill the form in, and click submit. Then the server receives that request and tries to insert the record in the database. This could be a success or a failure. In both cases you are redirected to the main view with the users list. Then the success/failure message is displayed along the list of users. At the moment, when I finish the database transaction, I redirect the user to the main view with a request parameter that holds the message. The main view gets that message and if it's not null, it displays the message. Altough this works, it has some drawbacks. For example, if the user reloads the view, the message still pops up. So I'm sure this is not the way to do it. There are more possibilities to do the same but I was wondering what's the most common way to achieve this (saving in session, request attribute instead of request parameter..., and how to dispose the message once is shown. Thanks for your help!

I know javac forces the programmer to handle checked exceptions which need to be thrown by the method or handled using try-catch/finally. And it will not stop programmer from throwing an unchecked exception. I also know why we do try-catch/finally and understood why java made certain set of exceptions checked. But I am not able to understand the below: Q1) Why should a method "throws" an exception. What is the benefit we get out of it? I think, either a method throws or does not throw using "throws" same thing is happening!!! Q2) What happens internally when a method "throws" an exception? Q3) I am thinking "Errors" are classified differently from "Exceptions" only to highlight them as "there won't be much from programmer's side to do when they occur" but we can do "throws" "try-catch/finally" for them as usual and everything else is also as same as with "Exception"*s. Please correct me if I am wrong. Please help me. Thank you in advance.
I'm facing a rather weird issue in Netbeans at the moment. When attempting to deploy a maven project to an external repository in Netbeans I get a: Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-deploy-plugin...... Return code is: 401, ReasonPhrase: Unauthorized. I've set up a maven project in netbeans and added a custom build goal to deploy (using mvn deploy). All works well until the deploy stage where the actual deploy is failing. The repository I use has a username/password combination required which has been defined in my settings.xml file for Maven and deploying using the command line works without issue (i.e. I open command prompt and type mvn deploy in the project directory and I get a build success). After some experimenting I determined that when netbeans calls maven for building, the settings.xml file is somehow not being read. I've tried putting the settings file in my user.home\.m2\ directory as well without success. Am I missing something or is this just a bug with netbeans? Netbeans is running: mvn -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"<path to netbeans>\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" deploy and everything works until the deploy stage. Edit: I've tried switching from the bunched maven that netbeans provides to my personal installation with no avail. I am running Windows 7 x84-64.
I am new to both java and eclipse, I have been trying to debug an android app on a device. It is a small project with a jar file reference. I read similar questions but they didn't help. What I need is to be able to debug the source codes of the jar file so I attached the source codes ( which I obtained using a decompiler ) and I am able to go into source codes of the library so I thought I did that correctly. But I can not succeed in debugging into these source codes; in debug mode it skipps breakpoints (only the ones in the source files which are attached to jar file) and when I try to 'step into code' it goes to random lines skips lines when debugging. I am using the latest versions of eclipse, android sdk and jdk. I don't know what causes this problem and I'd like to know. Thanks in advance, I hope I explained sufficiently.
For some reason Intellij IDEA's 'save console output to file' option in run/debug configurations gets truncated for my TestNG test runs. Other posters have pointed out that to actually see the console output for all the tests, you have to drill down on the tree in the IDEA Run window, click + on package, click + on test class, etc. then click on each test method to see it's console output. EG: IntelliJ IDEA TestNG output console clears And: Intellij not shows test results in console However I don't see a post anywhere explaining how to actually log all of this to one log file. And I really don't get why IDEA must break up one test run's console outs to so many places in the tree, seems kind of silly. Anyway, all I'm getting in the log file is my initialization class output, but nothing from any of the subsequent tests (drilled further down in the tree). Any suggestions how to make IDEA logging work with TestNG much appreciated.
I'm trying to start a tomcat instance(the only tomcat I have), and I'm getting some weird problems, I know that this error: Failed to initialize end point associated with ProtocolHandler is because some other application is using the same port, but if I change the port in the server.xml and run the startup.bat again I get the same error but now pointing to the new port, every time y change it I get the same error, also I check for other apps listening the same port using the command netstat -ano | find "9080", I tried this on 3 different machines (2 win7, 1 win server 2008), has anyone faced this problem before?

This question is a result of an answer to the following question: Injection of an autowired field failed in a multi-module Maven project - NoSuchBeanDefinitionException According to the answer from the aforementioned question, I configured the following structure of my Maven modules: Maven modules http://i62.tinypic.com/2ly0s38.png In this case, the class Foo from the base module can be used in tests in the module A (e.g. when it's autowired using the IFoo interface), but can't be used in the production code (which is contained in src/main/java). The Maven build fails when someone adds a reference to the Foo class in a class in the module A in the production code (under src/main/java). However, the automatic build in Eclipse doesn't fail in such case, because I use the m2eclipse plugin which has the Workspace Resolution enabled. I have to run the maven buiild (mvn clean install) to see the compilation failure. Afterwards, the error is still not immediately visible in the affected class in Eclipse. I have to make a change in the affected java class (e.g. add a space and save the file) and then I can see an error in this class. However, what is even more misleading, is the fact, that the compilation error shown in Eclipse has nothing to do with the real copilation error. - The compilation error is shown in the next line after the erroneous line. I don't want to disable the Workspace Resolution in the m2eclipse plugin, so that the newest sources are always used for the Eclipse's compile. However, it would be nice to see such compile error immediately in Eclipse and not have to perform a Maven build in order to see that compile error in Eclipse. Is it possible to see the compile error immediately after the Eclipse's compile?
I have a WSDL which was generated using Apache Axis 1.2.1. Now i am trying to create the stubs using JAX-WS 2.1 web service framework. While generating the stubs, i am getting the validation errors. Due to this issues, it is unable to create the stubs. !WSDL Validation Error Image I tried to create the stubs through many tools like MyEclipse IDE, SOAP UI Tool & Java's native wsimport.bat files. Above all three scenarios i had failed to create the stubs due to the unsupported format. But when i had tryied to create the stubs using SOAP UI tool with Apache Axis 1.2.1 libraries, then it was created the stubs. But those are different. My query is, WSDL is a W3C standard format. so, any JAVA API should fallow this standard, then why this WSDL is unable to create the stubs?? and So, I need to create the stubs using the JAX-WS 2.1 instead of Apache Axis 1.2.1. Please suggest me the possible answer... Click here for WSDL
I've been having a problem with eclipse that's been stressing me a lot. Whenever I start a new Java porject, everything goes smoothly and perfect, until I "clean" the project (Project -> Clean...) and everything goes to @#~%&... I keep getting: XYZ cannot be resolved to a type Multi-catch parameters are not allowed for source level below 1.7 <> operator is not allowed for source level below 1.7 That's very nice, only that I am importing all required classes and I do have 1.7 since the begginig. It's the only version I've installed. I've already tried this and other similar responses for the last few days with no avail. A solution was to create a new project, copy and paste all packages/clases, which worked for a while, but I added UMLet to the project and again... Removing UMLet plugin did nothing for me. BTW, even with the "errors", my project runs without any problem, therefore I know they're not real. I could keep working, but then, I can't see when a real error arises... Does anyone got a final solution to get rid of this false errors? EDIT: I forgot to mention that I'm working with Kepler. EDIT 2: Here are screen captures with the requested information.
I am getting a pair of errors (duplicate errors) that state the following Description Resource Path Location Type Error occured processing XML 'Unable to load schema mappings from location [META-INF/spring.schemas]'. See Error Log for more details root-context.xml /StudentInformationSystem/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring Unknown Spring Beans Problem I had a fresh install of Eclipse with Spring Tool Suite, and a fresh install of Spring Tool Suite 3.4.0 Release. I'm using the Windows 32 bit version, and I've developing using the latest Java SDK (1.7.0_51) I'm on 64 bit Windows 7. These two errors occur in the /src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/appServlet/servlet-context.xml and /StudentInformationSystem/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/root-context.xml When I try to run Spring MVC projects with this error, I see a Java OutOfBounds error as it mounts to the tc-server (the server that comes packages with Spring Tool Suite) Could not publish to the server. java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException This has been a very perplexing error as I can't seem to find an issue with my spring installation, my server installation, or anything wrong with running other types of projects (spring projects/appications from the console) I'm assuming this is related to MVC specifically, but the many Spring MVC template projects not working questions and their solutions have not helped me through the issue (although I may need to keep digging, there seem to be a lot of them with different wordings) Any help with this would be appreciated. The same error occurs when I use imports of projects that I know work in the environments on my peers computers (I have an entire group that are running the same application that don't have the issue)
I am reading the EJB specification and I got confused by a contradiction from my point of view and particularly regarding the way the Container behaves when a System Exception is thrown in lifecycle callback method of Singleton Bean. Section 12.3.1 : A runtime exception thrown by any lifecycle interceptor callback method causes the bean instance and its interceptors to be discarded after the interceptor chain unwindsce and any associated interceptor instances are discarded (except for Singleton Beans). Section 4.8.4 : Errors occurring during Singleton initialization are considered fatal and must result in the discarding of the Singleton instance. Possible initialization errors include injection failure, a system exception thrown from a PostConstruct method, or the failure of a PostConstruct method container-managed transaction to successfully commit. Unlike instances of other component types, system exceptions thrown from business methods or callbacks of a Singleton do not result in the destruction of the Singleton instance. So, what is true according the Section 4.8.4? If a System Exception is thrown in a @PostConstruct method or the Interceptor @PostConstruct method is the Bean discarded? I have tried it throwing an EJBException and the result was that the Beans initialization failed. More surprising was the fact, that when throwing an EJBException from a Singleton Bean Business Method, the client received the Exception and no other method was further executed. Can I assume that the Bean Instance was discarded? According to the Specification that should not have caused the destruction of the Bean Instance. What is true in both cases?
I'm working on a project where we are migrating code from Jetty to Jboss. This code is used as an API where different services is calling the service, the service perform the operation and returns the data, but if something goes wrong during the process exceptions are thrown and finally caught in the top level class. When using Jetty this worked good, hence the Jetty servlet engine added the message sent to the HttpServletResponse sendError function to the status line. But in Jboss, the default status is instead added: Jetty: return: 500: My Custom error Jboss: 500: Internal Server Error I've not been able to add the *USE_CUSTOM_STATUS_MSG_IN_HEADER* to the Jboss, so I thought I might customize the response by creating a HttpServletResponseWrapper and overriding either the sendError or setStatus message to do what I need and return the content in a way I need it. But, I'm unsure on how to perform this, or if there are any better solutions. best, Henrik

But on another server I am getting zip bomb exception for the same file. We are using same tika standalone jar at both instances. But I am not able to identify the issue.

iam a complete newbie in this area and dont know what to do. For a Java ee tutorial i have to install the GlassFish server on my Windows 7. I have followed the instructions and installed the newest JDK. After i have downloaded the GlassFish native installer with multilingual from this website glassfish.java.net/download.html i pressed the exe and it starts to install, but after 30 seconds it stops and a window pops and says that the software was not correctly installed that i have to do it again with the correct settings. The result of the tried install is that the GlassFish installer creates a glassfish4 folder under c:/glassfish4 but the glassfish4 folder is complete empty. The newest JDK is installed even so i did not know what to do. Than i choose to install the GlassFish server 3 and everything worked fine. A glassfish3 folder was created under c:/glassfish3 and i have installed the glassfish tools for eclipse. The problem here is that the glassfish3 installer did not create the domain1 folder. I followed the instruction given in this question eclipse error: glassfish\domains\domain1 does not exist but the command glassfish-install-dir\bin\asadmin create-domain your-domain-name doesnt work i get the same error message like the poster of this question that cmd gives path error. I also tried to execute the glassFish4 installer exe as admin but it failed also. Now i dont know what to and how to install the GlassFish4 server correctly it is so frustrating. Please help!

I don't know if it is the right place to ask, if not tell me I will migrate my question elsewhere. I am using OSX (Maverick) and I am trying to install the JDK 7 in order to use javaFX. So I downloaded the .dmg package from oracle and when I double click on the package, I get the error message can't found mountable file systems. In the documentation I found this alert: If you download Java 7, you will not be able to run Java content in Chrome on Mac OS X and will need to use a 64-bit browser (such as Safari or Firefox) to run Java content within a browser. Additionally, installing Java 7 will disable the ability to use Apple Java 6 on your system. So how can I properly install the JDK 7? and Is it dangerous to install it? Could it mess up all my settings, knowing that I only want to use the JDK 7 to run some java project ?
[Note: question basically re-edited after a lot of playing around] In Java, you have Charset, defining a character encoding. From a Charset, you can obtain two objects: a CharsetEncoder, to turn a char sequence into a byte sequence; a CharsetDecoder, to turn a byte sequence into a char sequence. Both of these classes have the following methods defined: .onUnmappableCharacter() and .onMalformedInput(). If you tell them for each of these to CodingErrorAction.REPORT they will throw either of these two exceptions: UnmappableCharacterException and MalformedInputException. With a CharsetEncoder, I am able to generate both of them: feed it with a CharBuffer containing two high surrogates following one another --> MalformedInputException; feed it with a CharBuffer containing a char (or char sequence) which the encoding cannot represent: UnmappableCharacterException. With a CharsetDecoder: feed it with an illegal byte sequence: MalformedInputException -- easy to do; UnmappableCharacterException --> how? In spite of all my research, I just couldn't do it. All of this in spite of having played a lot with CharsetDecoder. I could find no combination of Charset and byte sequence able to generare this error... Is there any at all?
I have an timer process which reads through lotus notes 5 and dumps the read document in modeshape repository. The process writes the timestamp and other relevant information into a DB table and uses this to pick up where it was stopped and then read the rest of the docs. The problem comes when the app is undeployed and redeployed again. When I do that, While a session is created with Lotus notes, it throws me an exception : ava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library C:\Domino\nlsxbe.dll already loaded in another classloader that's obvious because redeployment didn't remove the dependent dlls and Jars from JVM. I need a solution where in I can remove the dependents from JVM or reference the same dlls and resources while trying to create session the next time. Note - I don't have the code where the LOTUS notes api's try to load the dependents and I don't even know the dependent APIs and DLLs which are needed to create the connection so I moved the whole installation folder of lotus notes domino client to my java.library.path Please help, This is just driving me nuts. Probably a very simple issue but I need someexpert advice how to accomplish this in a better way.
I have a Web app running on Apache Tomcat 6, using ZK, Hibernate and Jaybird JDBC for accessing a Firebird database. For some unknown reason, after a not yet mapped operation in the app that performs a dynamic SQL, it crashes with the following exception: ERROR: org.springframework.transaction.TransactionSystemException: Could not roll back JPA transaction; nested exception is javax.persistence.PersistenceException: unexpected error when rollbacking javax.persistence.PersistenceException: unexpected error when rollbacking org.hibernate.TransactionException: JDBC rollback failed [SQL: 335544726, HY000] org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBSQLException: GDS Exception. 335544726.

We are using the Bitnami version of Solr 4.6.0-1 on a 64bit windows installation with 64bit Java 1.7U51 and we are seeing consistent issues with PermGen exceptions. We have the permgen configured to be 512MB. Bitnami ships with a 32bit version of Java for windows and we are replacing it with a 64bit version. Passed in Java Options: -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -Xms3072M -Xmx6144M -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=75 -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:NewRatio=3 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=8 This is our use case: We have what we call a database core which remains fairly static and contains the imported contents of a table from SQL server. We then have user cores which contain the record ids of results from a text search outside of Solr. We then query for the data we want from the database core and limit the results to the content of the user core. This allows us to combine facet data from Solr with the search results from another engine. We are creating the user cores on demand and removing them when the user logs out. Our issue is the constant creation and removal of user cores combined with the constant importing seems to push us over our PermGen limit. The user cores are removed at the end of every session and as a test I made an application that would loop creating the user core, import a set of data to it, query the database core using it as a limiter and then remove the user core. My expectation was in this scenario that all the permgen associated with that user cores would be freed upon it's unload and allow permgen to reclaim that memory during a garbage collection. This was not the case, it would constantly go up until the application would exhaust the memory. I also investigated whether the there was a connection between the two cores left behind because I was joining them together in a query but even unloading the database core after unloading all the user cores won't prevent the limit from being hit or any memory to be garbage collected from Solr. Is this a known issue with creating and unloading a large number of cores? Could it be configuration based for the core? Is there something other than unloading that needs to happen to free the references? Thanks Notes: I've tried using tools to determine if it's a leak within Solr such as Plumbr and my activities turned up nothing.
I created a Web Service Consumer. I want to call a method that is named setCredentials so I can pass my authentication information to the service. I have two entities that import the web service consumer, an agent and a java library, meant to be called from LotusScript. The strange thing is that on my agent everything works fine. Library compiles OK, but when it is executed from LotusScript and reaches that line stub.setCredentials("xxxx","ttttt"); Java throws a java.lang.nosuchmethod error. What can I be doing wrong? Thank you so much in advance for your help. Update: Maybe I didn't explain fully. The action occurs fully inside java. This is sort of a test. On LotusScript I am just calling the constructor with the sequence GetClass/CreateObject. The code is inside the constructor (For test sake). And it looks precisely the same, both on my test agent and on java library. Answering your question, Jason, no , setCredentials is part of a certain lotus.domino.types.PortTypeBase Interface. When I consume the .wsdl to create a web service consumer, I can see from the generated .java files that my interface extends portTypeBase and Remote
I've got a problem when trying to execute specific jar files in code. My objective was to create GUI application (wizard) in which user selects various xml files, selects a jar file to execute and provide it with input xml. To execute jar, I use this code: 1: URL[] urls = fillUrls(); 2: loader = new URLClassLoader(urls); 3: Class<?> cls = loader.loadClass(className); 4: Method execute = cls.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, Properties.class, StringBuffer.class, StringBuffer.class, IContext.class); // method name is declared as: // private final String methodName = "execute"; Method fillUrls on line 1 returns URLs of executed jar and other libraries which are required by executed jar to run. If omitted, line 3 would throw an exception. When method reaches line 4 the java.lang.NoSuchMethodException is thrown. Strange thing is, that the executed class in jar implements an interface so there is no chance that there will be no such method. And to make it more interesting, jar files I used for testing runs perfectly, jars supplied by other guys don't... So could it be something wrong with my code, or is it the problem how are the jar files exported? And is there any way to prove it? Exported jar are from maven2 project.
I'm reading the code of Guava's Ints.max(int... array) (and similarly, Ints.min, Longs.min, etc.) They throw an IllegalArgumentException if array.length == 0 (This is Guava 15.0). I wonder why they do not return the "identity element" in this case, instead of throwing an exception. By "identity element" I mean the element behaving like 1 for product, or 0 for sum. That is, I would expect Ints.min() to be Integer.MAX_VALUE, Ints.max() to be Integer.MIN_VALUE, and so on. The rationale behind this is that if you split an array in two, the min of the whole array must be the min between the mins of both sub arrays. Or, for the mathematically inclined, the sum over an empty set of real numbers is 0, the product is 1, the union of an empty collection of sets is the empty set, and so on. Since Guava libraries tend to be carefully produced, I guess there must be an explanation for throwing an exception here. So the question is: why? Edit: I understand that most people expect max and min of an array to be an element of the array, but this is because max/min of two elements is always one of them. On the other hand, if one regards max/min just as (commutative) binary operations, returning the identity element makes more sense. To me.
I am trying to still solve my other issue, but arguably this side problem is a separate topic, so I am posting this request separately. I downloaded "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from the Eclipse website (Kepler, Windows, 64-bit). I placed the contents into a folder, "C:\Program Files\Development\Tools\Eclipse", and proceeded to install SWT. I went to "Menu > Help > Install New Software..." and entered kepler. I then went to 'General Productivity Tools' and selected the SWT components. After restarting, I had SWT installed. I then went to "Menu > File > New > Other... > WindowBuilder > SWT Designer > SWT > Application Window" and clicked on next. That yields the following image. My OS is Windows 7 64-bit. The folder exists just fine. Forward slashes or backwards slashes, no slashes, browse, whatever, I tried it all, and the error is the same. How can I bypass this error? Am I looking at a bug with the 64-bit Eclipse? I did try restarting my computer, and the installation is fresh.
I've used previously maven 3 and it was easy to run anything from IntelliJ IDEA 13, be at main classes or tests - it worked through maven settings. But now I am trying to debug my java project in IDEA with Gradle 1.11. The problem is that idea now creates /out/* directory and trying to run my classes from there instead of using gradle settings and build setups - I mean, with maven I could debug my java project by this: Set debug configurations Run it under debug 2 step will call maven install and will run my java project from target/classes/ directory But with gradle project idea not uses gradle structure. How can I debug my java project right from IDEA IDE with gradle? P.S. I can run gradle test under debug in IDEA and it works perfectly, but I need something like gradle debug or gradle run to set breakpoint in IDE, run my Main class and launch my java application through IDE. Hope it is clear what I want to do.
In an effort to limit debug code from making its way into my release APK, I'm attempting to use a DebugMyApplication subclass for debug builds, but the normal MyApplication class in release. Is it possible to use an alternate Application subclass in Debug vs Release builds? I've tried: Define An AndroidManifest.xml file in the root of src/debug with an alternate definition of the <application> element. Gradle warns me that Main manifest has X but library has Y and the DebugMyApplication isn't used. Declare the Application subclass's fully qualified name as a resource which can be defined separately in my debug res files, but <application android:name="@string/xyz"/> is interpreted as a literal package name instead of a reference. For some background on my broader goal: Provide an alternate Dagger module which supplies some static mocked web service responses that will not be found in the release APK. Subclassing my application's getModuleList() method and changing the module list declaration seemed like the best bet. Thanks for any help!

I have an embedded Derby DB and work with hibernate. In my config file I use create but I also tried create-drop. The problem is, that drop table if exists fails at the beginning of my hibernate test and I had changed the mapped classes so that i.e. some not null fields don't exists anymore. Thus there is everytime a failure that I can't save null in this field. How can I get rid of this problem? I thought of some solutions but I don't know how to do these. The 1st solution I considerd was that I deleted the embedded Derby DB and start by zero, which isn't a problem but I don't know how to do it. My 2nd solution was that I changed to create-drop and ran the test without any db communication so that the schema get dropped at the end, but it doesn't looked like that there was a drop schema command at the end and it didn't helped me out.
Say you have a class called Timer. When a user tries to call the method Timer#start(), the code checks if the timer has already been started. If it has, then it can't start it again. Now, say this class is a part of a library/API. The developer can't know that the method isn't being called inappropriately, so they want to bring attention to any improper calls. The two ways to do so would be to a) print a simple error message (so-and-so has called a method inappropriately), or b) throw an exception. In my opinion, the exception that would make the most sense is an IllegalAccessException, though this isn't its intention as stated by Sun. However, I've seen it used in cases that have nothing to do with visibility and are simply throwing it to call attention to a bad call. My question is, would this situation call for (haha, pun) said exception, or is there a better one suited to it? Or, would it be best to create a new one or to simply print an error line?
disclaimer Hi, you could say this is a google-able question, but I've been looking around and all the examples I see are super specific to a certain problem, so I decided to just post my own question with my specific problem - some code here: http://pastebin.com/5ttK8Dry (I don't want it posted because I don't want someone googling my code, finding it online, and think that I copied it from somewhere because this site will show up... please leave it in the pastebin. If it somehow gets deleted, I will just post it again immediately). I hope you guys appreciate all my headers... :P Every time I use this site I get flak for having an unclear question, so I hope this one is very straightforward to follow!! Explanation of current code The code accepts a user-inputted wind speed. It uses a generic try-catch block to stop an input mismatch exception, and uses an if-statement to make sure the value entered is within the legal range. (See pastebin) What I have to do I now have an Environment class that has "wind speed" as a private attribute. In short, I need to create an object-oriented version of the code I have in the pastebin. What I know I have to code my own exceptions and encapsulate them, and then throw them when I'm setting the windpeed in my main class - if I supply a value that is illegal, the program should behave the same as it did before. What I need help on I don't really know where to start. In the code I have now, I see that I would need 2 exceptions - one for inputMismatch (which is already part of java), and one if I enter a value too high/low. I know I have to code my own exception for the latter, but what about the former? That exception already exists... The ultimate question (a) How do I create my own exception to be thrown if the user enters a value too high/low? (b) How do I incorporate an exception that already exists into the process? I can probably figure out the rest from there - I just need a place to get started.
I know this issue has been visited several times, but I haven't found the solution to my problem: I reserve 1024 MB for the virtual machine with > options(java.parameters = "-Xmx1024m") > library(XLConnect) xlcMemoryReport finds only around 15 MB and xlcFreeMemory doesn't help (actually sometimes further reduces available memory) > xlcMemoryReport() Amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM): 14.79472 MB > xlcFreeMemory() > xlcMemoryReport() Amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM): 15.05308 MB when I try to load a 26 MB file it fails, but actually frees up the memory: > res <- readWorksheet(loadWorkbook("bigFile.xlsx"),sheet=1) error in evaluating the argument 'object' in selecting a method for function 'readWorksheet': Error: OutOfMemoryError (Java): Java heap space > xlcMemoryReport() Amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM): 947.3003 MB > res <- readWorksheet(loadWorkbook("bigFile.xlsx"),sheet=1) error in evaluating the argument 'object' in selecting a method for function 'readWorksheet': Error: OutOfMemoryError (Java): Java heap space > xlcMemoryReport() Amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM): 936.7464 MB Why xlcMemoryReport does not find the reserved memory at first but finds it after I try reading the file? Is it possible that >900 MB is not sufficient for XLConnect to load a 26 MB file? Any idea how I can make this work? (of course I could use CSV files, but that is an inconvenience for my users)
I am new to android development, and i work on projects that combine java and native code. I had a problem debugging native code until i saw the following link: http://mhandroid.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/using-eclipse-for-android-cc-debugging/ which solved the problem when i worked with only one package. The thing is - i am now trying to work with 2 packages, the first is the java application and the second (which is imported by the first) is an API java layer which calls for the native functions. when i came across a problem and wanted to debug (like the way the link shows), i found that i cannot run ndk-gdb on the second package because its a library, and the first package does not include a jni folder (it is not native), so ndk-gdb is not working there also. I tried creating a jni folder in the first package and copied the .mk files there but i guess that it doesn't work like that. anyway i get this message when i run ndk-build. make: * No rule to make target 'jni/VoiceIttPlatform.cpp', needed by 'obj/local/armeabi/objs-debug/VoiceIttPlatform/VoiceIttPlatform.o'. Stop. so ndk-gdb and everything else doesn't work. I am using cygwin, adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20130917, android-ndk-r9 on a win7 64 bit O.S. Your help is very much appreciated!
I'm running Eclipse Kepler with Glassfish 4. I'm developing a set of bundles/plugins, which get deployed to the glassfish autodeploy folder. Also deployed to that folder are bundles from my target definition. The problem is when debugging the source lookup for the bundles from the target doesn't work. I have added the bundle pool directory to the source lookup to no avail. I have added the glassfish autodeploy directory to the source lookup to no avail. The source bundles are in both folders together with the "binary" bundles and they share the same name with the "binary" bundles except for "source", e.g.: com.x.y.z_1.3.jar com.x.y.z.source_1.3.jar I can get Eclipse to recognize the source bundle correctly if instead of adding the directory I add the individual jar files. But this is cumbersome because then I have to add each jar file and also update the source lookup every time I update the target definition to a newer version. Is there a way to make Eclipse find the correct source bundles?
I'm looking for a way that I can customize the field/object name given in the MethodArgumentNotValidException and the ConstraintViolationException. Here's the context: I am performing validation on the server, but I want to map the server validation errors back to the input fields on the client (to show server errors directly on the input in the UI). I'm using an angular directive that can make this happen so long as I have an id that the directive recognizes from the server. I'm currently using almost all annotations to do the server-side validation and I'd like to keep it that way. Doing the validation programmatically (through a javax.validation.Validator) would allow me to customize what gets thrown in the exception since I control how the exception is populated and thrown. The only solution I've come up with so far is to create my own validator to replace the @Valid annotation to put in my own logic for mapping the client-side ids with the server-side fields. But.... this doesn't feel right and there are likely hidden pitfalls in trying to do this. I also wouldn't expect that this is the first time someone needed to do this. So, smart people of the stackoverflow what say ye?
I would like to know, whether there is a possibility that the implementation of the client side, could be causing this IOException? As far as I know, this exception is caused by the remote site, sending the RST packet, effectively shutting down the connection. Whatever answers I have come up with so far, all claim that this is the server's fault. But the problem is the following. I am communicating with the server via TCP sockets and the android app is the client. The communication used to work prefectly, but after making some modifications (to the client side ONLY), I keep getting this exception. I am having a hard time pinpointing the source of the problem, because the updates I've made had nothing to do with the communication implementation. I've only added another query for the server to handle. Is it possible to produce this exception from the client side(that my code, could cause the remote side to produce this outcome)? Perhaps by overloading the server with requests? Or maybe Android is closing my sockets, by itself? Or perhaps I am somehow closing the sockets, but that would probably produce a different type of exception. Any advice on the matter would be very much appreciated.
I'm trying to add the openDeclaration function to my own Eclipse plugin editor. Until now I didn't really understand how the f3 functionality works (I read something about Hyperlinking, openAction, and compilationUnit.findDeclaringNode()), but i cannot put the pieces together and understand how it work. Until now i thought it works like this: While parsing the code, the tokens which are read will be added to the ast. The hierarchy level is IJavaProject/IPackageFragmentRoot/IPackageFragment/ICompilationUnit/{IType / IField / IMethod} With jdt it is possible to work with this ast. Each Java file is represented with a compilation unit. If I press f3, a ActionHandler is started which takes the IjavaElement that I hover in this moment. Right now I have the IJavaElement in my Editor Plugin but I don't know how to jump to the corresponding type/method associated with the declaration in the compilation unit. And I don't know what will happen if the declaring node is not in the same compilation unit, like if it's a basic type (Such as a String or an Integer). Maybe if everything if was more clear, I could follow the way how the default Java editor is doing this task. How do I get the pieces together or how can I debug the functionality?
I am working on Google cloud messaging service in my android app. For this I need to register my android app to GCM server. The gcm registration is failing. I have checked: The gcm register code is Async call. The sender id (project id) is correct. The manifest file is as per the google doc. http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/client.html My device has google account set up. I have tried both the cases - add google-play-services jar and import it as project. I even went on to specify the version number (com.google.android.gms.version) in manifest as per this http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html#Setup Where and why would this be failing? When I catch the exception, exception cause is NULL. I had done a demo app for this GCM part and it was working fine. I had used Eclipse with JellyBean SDK. I extended this project to make the current app - package stucture remains same. But now am on Kitkat SDK. I used the same Sender Id as before to register with GCM. It failed giving null id. I created new project at cloud console and used its project number as sender id. Still same error. Registration Id is null. I don't think Sender Id should be any issue. Any help would be appreciated.
I have problem with starting Apache Tomcat 6 from Netbeans IDE 7.4 (on 7.3 version I had the same troubles. Other people mentioned that this problem exist also in other versions, like 8.0 etc). What did I do: remove installed Tomcat 7 (without removing it, I had the same difficulties) add new server, downloaded from Apache Tomcat website (version apache-tomcat-6.0.39, with other version I had the same problems) my server location: D:\apache-tomcat-netbeans system variable CATALINA_HOME: D:\apache-tomcat-netbeans system variable JAVA HOME: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51\ tomcat user: I let netbeans creating new user, called tomcat with password tomcat. When I open {tomcat}\conf\tomcat-users.xml file after adding server, there is info about my user: < user password="tomcat" roles="manager,admin" username="tomcat"/ > When I now click "start", I got "Starting of Tomcat failed". My suspicions: I'm working on Windows 7 as administrator, so I think this is not a problem with privileges to files. Disabling proxy didn't helps. Logs: There is only one log file created: localhost.2014-03-06.log and it is totally empty. Starting Netbeans "as administrator" didn't helps. From command line everything is all right, I have no problems with starting in normal or debug mode (catalina.bat jpda start or startup.bat)

I am a newbie with designing stuff though I have some experience as a developer. My question is related to the statement - "It is always a good practice to design the exception hierarchy at the start of the project" After much of reading and researching the definition of a checked and unchecked exception is well clear. However, I still wonder what is the best practices in designing the exception hierarchy for an application. Is the below approach right? Create your own application specific top level exceptions MyAppRuntimeException MyAppCheckedException Subclass MyAppCheckedException with all your business exceptions where you want the caller to take a specific exception. For example TryWithADifferentInputException - This is not the right input, correct it TryAlternateServiceException - This service is not available, but you can choose another service that will do the job Similarly subclass your runtime exception which spiral up and are captured only by something like the spring exception resolver and display appropriate message on front end. Another thing that bugs me is how to come up with most of the exception scenarios at the start of the project. What should be the strategy to do so.
I am debugging an android project. I set a number of breakpoints. Then I go to DDMS (or click debug or debug as). The code is stopping but not in the source. Apparently it is stopping in the byte code of .class files. Basically, the name of the file where it is supposed to break would show up, with a red text "source not found". Does anyone know how to fix this? Yesterday it was on and off: when it comes on like that I would restart eclipse and if I am luck it would work otherwise I would have to restart again. Does anyone know a good stable fix for this? Note that I am using GEP for app-engine connected android project. So I have Java 7 installed for app engine and Java 6 for android. Still, this problem is relatively new. Yesterday it was on and off. Today, no luck at all.
I am searching for a way to start the Websphere Liberty profile in debug mode from the command line? I want to be able to start Liberty, so that it is listening for debug connections on a specific port. Then I would like to connect to Liberty from Eclipse, so that I can step through and debug the server code running in Liberty. I've tried integrating Liberty into Eclipse and using the Eclipse 'Servers' view. This works great and I can start and stop Liberty using debug mode. Unfortunately, this method does not satisfy my use case because the build process uses tools external to Eclipse. Essentially, I need a way to do this via the command line. I tried creating a jvm.options file for Liberty and starting it, but I still can't connect to the port I specified. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but thus far I haven't figured it out. This page has some info on jvm.options
I'm really no debugging expert and lately I came across a problem which hopefully has an easy solution. When I test and debug the Mathematica plugin for IDEA, I write some code, build it and run it in a sandbox IDEA. For those who are not familiar with writing plugins for IDEA: The main problem is, that all the UI code is already there because it comes with IDEA. My plugin only implements specific interfaces which are required to make IDEA understand the Mathematica language. Therefore, setting a breakpoint or throwing something in an onClickListener like suggested by @Jeroen is not possible, because I virtually haven't written any single line of UI code*. Now I had the situation that everything works fine, but when I cancel a specific action, something weird happens. I have no idea which specific method (it is none of mine!) is called at the moment when I press Esc to cancel this action. The current point is very likely deep inside the sources of IDEA which I have and which I can navigate with the debugger!. Question: What is the easiest way in Java to make the debugger break, wherever it might be when I press Esc in the UI-program I currently debug? *This is not entirely true, but for the sake of a general solution I would like to think of it that way.
i have done one small coding in mainactivity.java and now i have to create another java in src folder in android eclipse but i am not able to do it i want to create as shown below so i want to create new class stackinfoactivity . i click on the next after choosing android activity in the menu menu i choose blank and hit next details entered and click on next button instead of creating a class i am getting an error i have added all the unique details is there any problem with my eclipse i need to correct my eclipse i clicked on finish button the activity will not get created i have colored the image above please anyone suggest me how to correct and get rid of this error
So I have this one question. Lets say we have classes: Main, Info, Cats, Food Now, lets say that in main we create new object Info. In Info object we are saving list of Cats that have been created. Cats are being created and stored in Info class and Food is being created and stored in Cats class. Now lets say, that in Main class, I want to get specific Food object, which is stored in Cats class. So, in order to do so we do the following: Info.getFood(name). Then in Info's getFood method we say Cats.getFood(name). Finally, in Cats class we have method getFood, in which we try to find Food object by its field "name". If we are unable to find such an element, we throw NoSuchElement exception rather than return an object. Here is my question: If we throw exception in Cats class getFood method, should we catch that exception in Main class (where our interface is), in Info class (which is our system class) or in both of them?
This is possibly a duplicate of this question (Avoiding Compiler warnings on code generated by xjc) but since I am not very well versed in XJC/JAXB custom bindings idiosyncrasies, I'll presume I may have misunderstood the mentioned question. My question seems simple enough - how can I add @SuppressWarnings("all") annotation to generated JAXB class? We have 0 warning policy on our project and after JAXB generation step, we end up with 350+ warnings which are just terrible noise. I would expect either a simple flag on the XJC or at least an easy way to provide such info but I cannot find any. From what I've seen in my travels, people do one of these things: @lexicore's JAXB2 Annotate Plugin which, according to examples, seems to do the job but to add a whole framework and hundreds of kB of code just to add simple annotation to a bunch of classes? Really??, Custom JAXB bindings (I may be mistaken but this seems very arcane and I am not fully sure if it were event possible to do it this way), Custom ANT target which will do a search-and-replace post-JAXB generation, Eclipse 4+ seems to have an option to filter out warnings on selected projects but for various historical/legacy reasons we're stuck on Eclipse 3.7.2 (Indigo), Custom XJC plugin which would do the annotation insertion (as suggested by one of the commenters, see here), Placing all of the generated classes in a JAR, making the JAR a dependency of the project and then removing generated code altogether. Formerly, we dealt with this by shoving the XML-related code in a separate Eclipse project and then disabling the warnings/errors on the project. Now, as part of code consolidation/refactoring, we've reshuffled things around and no longer have that luxury. Is there really no elegant solution for such a seemingly trivial problem? Any feedback/thoughts are greatly appreciated. FWIW, our project uses Ant as build system.
I'm using Eclipse Juno and I get this error when I launch it on a certain workspace: An error has occurred.

I was posting an answer to this question, and I realized that I'm confused over something. I asked a few co-workers comfortable in Java and we're all a little stumped. What happens in this scenario: Start JVM with start-up size of 512MB and maximum size of 2GB. Your underlying OS has 1GB of memory left, so the JVM is allowed to start up. Your program uses over 1GB of memory. At this point, you've used all available JVM memory, but you haven't breached the JVM memory limit you set up on launch. The OS is constraining your ability to get more resources, not the JVM itself. I would have thought that this would result in an OutOfMemoryError, as you would get if you overran the 2GB JVM size limit. I have to admit though, in practice when we're running too many processes on our servers, I tend to see a slow-down and no memory exceptions. Please note that I'm aware of paging and that processes get killed off in Linux when memory is exhausted. I was interested in knowing if any additional mechanisms are in place at the JVM level that could cause more of a blocking effect since that's what the person in the other question was asking in his comment. I realize that the answer may simply be "No, there are no additional mechanisms in place." Follow-Up Questions/Comments Is this because memory exceptions are not thrown unless you hit the actual JVM memory limit? If so, what happens when the OS cannot give the JVM more memory when it hasn't reached its limit? Is there some kind of blocking or a similar mechanism until memory is available in the OS?
I am new to the Play Framework 2.2.1. Recently I got strange errors from the nettyException. Okay, here is the thing, I develop a Play project in Java. It works well in Mac. When I move the project to CentOS 6.5 server, and type command "play start" to run the application.

I am trying to get authentication code and access token but not able to get it as it returns code either in html header or in query string but both method is not supported by Nokia oauth-20. urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob This value signals to the Google Authorization Server that the authorization code should be returned in the title bar of the browser. other one: This value signals to the Google Authorization Server that the authorization code should be returned as a query string parameter to the web server on the client. Nokia oauth-20 Limitations: Reference: http://developer.nokia.com/resources/library/Java/developers-guides/data-handling/oauth-20/creating-an-invocation.html Redirect must be to an internet site The mechanism cannot support authentication scenarios where the redirect URL is not an internet site accessible by the proxy server, such as where it is “localhost”. Token accessibility The mechanism cannot support authentication scenarios where the token is not returned as part of the redirect URL (for example, if it is encoded in other metadata in the response such as page title). My question is that there is another option to get access token via web application calling the below url and it works fine if I try it in browser but if I call the link from my mobile using oauth 2 the access token got generated but calling any othe api gives me error 403 insufficient permission. https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&redirect_uri=https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf&response_type=token&client_id=598197514064-0kvbbg9uiurki0oht8c9hga2jqon5c6e.apps.googleusercontent.com Thanks Susobhan Panja
I have a situation in my webapp for which I haven't been able to find a good solution yet. In my app, a user can do a search against an external (to my app) music database. I conduct the search on their behalf and then present the results. Then they can choose to add one or more of those results to their user record. Internally, I create a row in a table for the song (if it's not already in my DB), copy the song information, and then add it to their collection. The problem is that two users could both attempt to add the same song to the DB (which has a uniqueness constraint). One user would succeed, and the other would fail, but not until the end of the overall transaction. If user A wins and user B does not, I don't want the addition of the song to the DB to fail; I want to catch that error, load the (now present) song from my DB, and continue with the request to add it to the user’s collection. From what I read in the Hibernate docs (here: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.6/reference/en-US/html/transactions.html#transactions-basics-uow), this is not how it's intended to be used. Sure, I can let the overall transaction fail, and report this to the user, but it's a bad user experience for a situation that should be recoverable. Is there a non-hacky way to handle this? Thanks!
I'm a beginner in Java projects and I want to know the best way to do something. I have developed a desktop application which show data from a table in database in a JTable, and when that table has a change, it has to show previous data + new records. Well, I made a thread: First of all, Start, show all the data in a JTable, executing a query. Thread: keep attention to database, executing a query, different from the first one, every X seconds. It's supposed that every single connection after executing query is closed, but from time to time appears this error: Listener refused the connection with the following error: ORA-12519, TNS:no appropriate service handler found I've read something about it exceeded the maximum number of proccesses admitted, and also probably I could solve it with Poolable Connection, but I'm not sure about how to do it. Could anyone help me with that? Thanks in advance!
I use fiddler a lot (esp. composer and reverse proxy features), in web debugging. I am able to successfully send traffic to my reverseproxy server ("myreverseproxy:8888") (basically using custom rules explained here - http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/usefiddlerasreverseproxy), and it works with most cases. However I tried to redirect traffic similar with one of the 3rd party dlls (native code - cant decompile to see whats happening) (basically I don't have a source - but it connects to a host on a specified port) - I wanted to observe the packets to take a closer look at headers, packets, authentication etc. But in this particular case reverse proxy is not working. probably the 3rd party 'dll' is not using http stack. My questions: Is there anything I can do in this particular case to understand how this external native assembly is connecting to the server? or fiddler cant be used as it probably cant intercept this traffic? if that is the case, what other tools I can use to intercept the traffic? Update Here are the things I observed: From client side, fiddler is unable to capture packets (probably the api's fiddler use at higher level) Then I setup reverse proxy, to make sure I catch the traffic at 'rever proxy server' - however fiddler still could catch the traffic. Thanks to Lex - looks like fiddler wont even show the packet if it cant decode payload as http (not too sure - but its my conjecture from Lex response and other posts) Then I have installed wireshark, captured the packets, and by default 'wireshark' showed the interactions between client and server as TLSv1 - so it confirms why fiddler couldn't catch Just to confirm I applied HTTP decoder to see if 'default decoder' assigned by wireshark is wrong - but, it couldn't decode details. So, it confirms the native module is using TLSv1, not https and that explains why I cant use fiddler. Special thanks to Lex. Regards!

SO having some issues with trying to debug a program that I'm using, and wondered if anyone could help me out. The current environment is I'm running Cassandra (v2), using cqlsh (v3) that comes with it. I'm making changes to some of it's functionality, and then using cqlsh to test commands to see if my changes are working as intended, or if not what the input looks like as I step through the program. I start up a debugging session (either in eclipse of IntelJ, doesn't really matter), firing up the server code to accept connections/input. I then load up cqlsh, and specify the keyspace that I want to use. This seems to work fine. I then execute a line of cql to test my changes via command line. What I expect to see is the command line entry being caught by the debugger in my IDE, where I can see how the input is handled by my code changes. What I'm seeing is nothing happening at all, as if no command was submitted. So my questions would be the following: 1) Should I see anything in my debugging IDE when executing commands as described above? 2) If not, how would you debug a server based application that has this configuration, especially in the realm of handling user input? 3) If so, what settings should I check to see if I have set correctly, or what processes should be followed to view and debug said submissions? I figure there has to be a better way then having 50,000 System.out.println() all over the place (assuming they'd even work), or at least, I hope there is. Thanks for anyone that reads this. Any questions (which I'm sure there may be since I'm probably not using the right descriptors) please ask away.
My console is giving the following error when trying to run an Android Project in Eclipse. WARNING: Application does not specify an API level requirement!

I'm pretty new to java and working on a program that should simulate the Mastermind game. Here's the description: Write an application in Java that allows a user to play the game Bulls and Cows against a computer. The game works as follows: The computer chooses a 4-digit number in secret. The digits must all be different. The user then guesses the number and the computer provides the number of matching digits. If the matching digit is in the right position it is a "bull", if it is on a different position it is a "cow" There are two classes that I'm allowed to have: Oracle and Game. Oracle class generates the 4-digit number that computer picks and calculates the number of bulls and cows in the player's guess. Game class gets the number of bulls and cows from Oracle and reports it. I'm getting this error when I run the program: the error appears to be here: at Game.play(Game.java:34) at BullsAndCows.main(BullsAndCows.java:5) Can you help me figure out what's wrong? Thanks a lot. these are the images of Oracle and Game classes as well as the main method
Please look at the below scenario: (PS: I am not trying to resolve the code too large compiler error as there are multiple elegant ways of doing it.) We are getting "Code too large" compilation error for one of our class. This class contains public String fields for label ID and value. We use this class for localization, except for English all other language labels come from .properties files. The reason we are getting this error is because we have a static block in which using reflection we are populating a HashMap with all public fields and their value. The number of fields have gone up to the extinct where we are crossing the 64K limit for a static method. One of the most feasible solution was to use .properties files for English labels as well. The issue is resolved, and here is the proposed solution: For the sake of discussion I will be calling this class MyLabels. We defined a super class for MyLabels called MyLabelsExt. And now we are adding labels into the super class instead of the MyLabels. By running some tests we confirmed that the map that we initialize in MyLables class contains all the fields from both MyLabels and MyLabelsExt class. Question: How come the 64K limit error was by passed when we started using the super class. Thanks, Manish.
I have a pure java (as in no native code) android app which is causing a dalvik vm crash when running on a api 7 device. I have not seen this crash with other devices of higher versions. If I start my app and leave it alone, the crash will usually occur within 10 minutes. Looking through the java thread dump (which was too large to include here), most of the threads are in the sleep state and those that aren't look benign. I'm quite used to debugging java issues on the android platform, but I don't know where to start with a native crash like this. 03-16 21:19:30.004 E/dalvikvm(6491): VM aborting 03-16 21:19:30.014 I/DEBUG (6274): * ** * ** * ** * ** * ** * 03-16 21:19:30.014 I/DEBUG (6274): Build fingerprint: 'zt180/zt180/zt180/:2.1-update1/ERE27/eng.root.20101021.113523:eng/test-keys' 03-16 21:19:30.014 I/DEBUG (6274): pid: 6491, tid: 6514 >>> com.dave.myapp <<< 03-16 21:19:30.014 I/DEBUG (6274): signal 11 (SIGSEGV), fault addr deadd00d 03-16 21:19:30.014 I/DEBUG (6274): r0 00000390 r1 afe135e5 r2 0000000c r3 deadd00d 03-16 21:19:30.014 I/DEBUG (6274): r4 00000026 r5 0013d250 r6 ad08b368 r7 00000000 03-16 21:19:30.014 I/DEBUG (6274): r8 ad0103c0 r9 ad089000 10 00000003 fp 492cbed8 03-16 21:19:30.014 I/DEBUG (6274): ip ad08b570 sp 492cbbe0 lr afe1459d pc ad038a36 cpsr 20000030 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #00 pc 00038a36 /system/lib/libdvm.so (dvmAbort) 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #01 pc 0005bb6a /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #02 pc 0005bdde /system/lib/libdvm.so (dvmFindSystemClassNoInit) 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #03 pc 0005c2f2 /system/lib/libdvm.so (dvmFindSystemClass) 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #04 pc 0003820a /system/lib/libdvm.so (dvmThrowChainedException) 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #05 pc 000165fc /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #06 pc 00013f58 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): code around pc: 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): ad038a24 4808e9f2 6b9b5823 d0002b00 4b064798 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): ad038a34 701c2426 ea5ef7d7 00052950 fffe3dfc 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): ad038a44 fffe7230 00000390 deadd00d b510b40e 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): code around lr: 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): afe1458c 220ce008 2b005eab 1c28d003 47889901 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): afe1459c 35544306 d5f43f01 2c006824 b003d1ee 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): afe145ac bdf01c30 00025906 000000bc 1c0fb5f0 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): stack: 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbba0 00000015 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbba4 afe13615 /system/lib/libc.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbba8 afe3a0b0 /system/lib/libc.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbac afe3a05c /system/lib/libc.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbb0 00000000 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbb4 afe1459d /system/lib/libc.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbb8 492cbbcc 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbbc afe135e5 /system/lib/libc.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbc0 ad08b368 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbc4 ad08b368 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbc8 0013d250 [heap] 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbcc ad08b368 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbd0 00000000 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbd4 afe13647 /system/lib/libc.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbd8 ad08b368 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbdc ad038a27 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #00 492cbbe0 ad08b368 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbe4 ad05bb6f /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): #01 492cbbe8 42973b52 /data/dalvik-cache/system@framework@core.jar@classes.dex 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbec ad08de18 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbf0 ad06e200 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.664 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbf4 00000000 03-16 21:19:31.684 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbf8 00000000 03-16 21:19:31.684 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbbfc ad038189 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.684 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbc00 492cbca8 03-16 21:19:31.684 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbc04 ad08b368 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.684 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbc08 ad06e200 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:31.684 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbc0c 00000000 03-16 21:19:31.684 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbc10 00000000 03-16 21:19:31.684 I/DEBUG (6274): 492cbc14 ad05bde3 /system/lib/libdvm.so 03-16 21:19:38.194 I/ActivityManager(2028): Process com.dave.myapp (pid 6491) has died.
I am getting a 404 error: The requested resource is not available in a spring mvc application that I am developing in eclipse and testing on a local instance of tomcat 7 using run as ... run on server from within eclipse. The error shows up when the application launches the root url of the app. I have not made changes to welcome.jsp, or to the xml config files since it worked last. Since the problem is NOT with the config files, I am not distracting this posting by adding them. Also note that there is no error log or stack trace in the eclipse console. How can I get my app to load without throwing this 404? NOTE: I am putting my own answer below. It turns out the solution was to right click on the server instance in the servers tab in eclipse, then do a clean, then publish, then run as...run on server again, which caused the app to load with a meaningful stack trace, which I then resolved easily. As I predicted above, this problem was with eclipse, it was not with the config files. This is a valid question. There was no need to downvote it or to vote to close it. I hope it helps others.
I'm trying to debug an oracle forms application. In production, when I load the application I get an error: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: oracle.forms.engine.Main I'm uncertain as to what is causing this issue. I've been searching forums for a bout half a day now, and it seems like it may have something to do with a java versioning issue. I've included the (slightly modified to protect my company) java console output, and if I'm reading it right, it looks like a certificate needs to be repackaged. But, when I look at the certificate for the site it says that it's verified by verisign. I'm using IE 9 to try to view the forms app, and I get a : java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: oracle.forms.engine.Main In the Java console I get the following output: Java Plug-in 1.6.0_45 Using JRE

We are counting some types of requests in a GAE: for each request the servlet gets the "channel" (counter index), and the increments the counter for this channel and hour. We are using sharded counters https://developers.google.com/appengine/articles/sharding_counters?csw=1 Once an hour a cron job runs, gets the count for each counter, stores it in a more efficient structure, and if the count is much lower than the day before, triggers an alert. This process had run successfully for some time, but recently we had one case with a severe under-count (50% and more under-count on many channels, many of them with count of several thousands). I was able to identify via logs and reference counts that the expected amounts of requests and counter-increments ran at this hour, and the problem is an under-count (either in the get() operation summing the shards or elsewhere). Is there any reasonable scenario, in which such a problem would occur?
I had a compilation problem with Eclipse with 1.7 JDK installed running on Mavericks: class file has wrong version 51.0, should be 49.0 So, as this looked like a javac versioning problem I removed all java versions. Installed 1.7_51, installed the Apple supplied 1.6 version so that Eclipse would run, changed sym links so 1.7 was the default. Same problem as before, the same project would not compile, though others did, Next step, strip the problem down to the bare bones i.e. remove ant etc from the equation - Test.java file used has no methods, just a main with System.out.println(). cd to the directory containing the source file and ran the compiler specifying full path to javac, having checked that JAVA_HOME was not set: $ /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/javac Test.java -verbose -extdirs . -endorseddirs . -cp . -bootclasspath /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar -version Output: javac 1.7.0_51 [parsing started Test.java] [parsing completed 67ms] [search path for source files: [.]] [search path for class files:[/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar, .]] [loading /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar(java/lang/Object.class)] Test.java:11: cannot access java.lang.Object bad class file: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar(java/lang/Object.class) class file has wrong version 51.0, should be 49.0 Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath. public class Test { ^ [total 336ms] 1 error Flumoxed.

I have a spring mvc app that runs perfectly on tomcat server when I click run as..run on server from within eclipse. However, when I add a CREATE TABLE command to the database creation code that runs on app startup, the result is a 404 error from tomcat when any url in the app is called. The database creation code is run from xml config files in the spring app using jdbc and spring's own tools. I have done a key word search of all files in my app by clicking control-H in eclipse, and the database creation script is the only file in the entire app that uses the word that is the table name. I have not built any of the entities or controllers yet to work with the data that would be entered in the new table. Also, I am able to add other "orphan" tables into my database from the mysql command line without causing any problems. When I comment out the code for creating the new table, the app launches and runs perfectly. But then when I uncomment the table creation code and try to relaunch the app, I get the same 404 error from tomcat. THERE IS NO STACK TRACE. THE ECLIPSE CONSOLE MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THE APP IS RUNNING, EVEN THOUGH IT GIVES 404 MESSAGES IN THE ABOVE DESCRIBED CONDITIONS. Why could the creation of a single table that is not connected to anything else cause 404 errors in a spring mvc app using tomcat server, hibernate, and jpa, even when none of the code in any level of the app references the table yet in any way?
I am working on a Java Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse. Everything was running smoothly until I realized that my package names were uppercase, and decided to change them. After changing them, I am getting ClassNotFoundExceptions at runtime. The code compiles fine. From what I understand, this is a runtime classpath issue.

Here is a snapshot of my Web Deployment Assembly: http://imgur.com/D0rg2aZ Does anyone know how I might go about fixing this? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Solution Found Thanks for responses everyone. Thankfully I managed to fix the issue by: Right clicking the project folder ---> Build Path ---> Configure Build Path Navigating to Source tab I saw that the default output folder was "WorkTicketSystem/build/classes." I switched this to "WorkTicketSystem/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes." And, voila. I'm not exactly sure why or how my actions fixed the problem, but if anyone could explain I would be very interested to hear it. For now I am just happy that it runs.
I'm experiencing a problem with a producer-consumer setup for a local bot competition (think Scalatron, but with more languages allowed, and using pipes to connect with stdin and stdout). The items are produced fine, and handled correctly by the consumer, however, the consumer's task in this setting is to call other pieces of software that might take up too much memory, hence the out of memory error. I've got a Python script (i.e. the consumer) continuously calling other pieces of code using subprocess.call. These are all submitted by other people for evaluation, however, sometimes one of these submitted pieces use so much memory, the engine produces an OutOfMemoryError, which causes the entire script to halt. There are three layers in the used setup: Consumer (Python) Game engine (Java) Players' bots (languages differ) The consumer calls the game engine using two bots as arguments: subprocess.call(['setsid', 'sudo', '-nu', 'botrunner', '/opt/bots/sh/run_bots.sh', bot1, bot2]). Inside the game engine a loop runs pitting the bots against each other, and afterwards all data is saved in a database so players can review their bots. The idea is, should a bot cause an error, to log the error and hand victory to the opponent. What is the correct place to catch this, though? Should this be done on the "highest" (i.e. consumer) level, or in the game engine itself?
I do have a problem and I searched for a solution for a very long time now, but did not find anything. Problem is: I do have a java-program, and I want to debug it. I have set a couple of break points in one of the methods i need to debug, but eclipse seems to just skip them when i run the debugger. I am sorry that i cannot provide any code here, because I do not have the permission to share it on the internet. But I can describe it's structure: The method where i put my break points is inherited from an interface. Is this the reason why the debugger does not see the break points? Does it stop at the declaration of the method in the interface, and not look into the implementation itself? Really guys I am frustrated about this. I am sure there is an easy solution for this, but I can't figure it out. And I have checked that the program really reaches the code in the method ;) Thank you a lot in advance! UPDATE: I have put a try-catch-block into the code where my breakpoints seem to fail, and print the stack trace to the console: It catches an error in a line where I do have a breakpoint. I have no idea what is wrong here.
In some of my methods, there are Too Many Parameters and very hard to maintain and read source code. And sometimes I am worried about the question "are they passing the appropriate values in the appropriate order?" I am using Checkstyle as my Eclipse plugin and that gives me warning for more than 7 parameters. I am not sure it may just be a coding standard and I don't care about it. But when passing many parameters through a view, service or dao, I have noticed that it was very hard to read and hard to modify at later times. So, I am trying to pass these parameters with... A number of Objects or Beans. But this give me another problems because my parameters wouldn't get any guarantee (not sure whether they are present or not). HashMap type parameters. But this may force me to check some validations and try to match keys from method-call sides. Above two approaches may also lose compile-time errors checking. Are there any suggestions to reduce parameter counts?
Given I have an exception of type 'java.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException' Is it possible to programmatically determine the column (or columns) in error? I ask this because I would like to map the error back to the client's data model to indicate field in error (for example a violation of a unique key). For example given a duplicate value is attempted to be inserted on a table, the 'java.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException' exception would be thrown with the following message: The statement was aborted because it would have caused a duplicate key value in a unique or primary key constraint or unique index identified by 'INDEX_NAME' defined on 'COLUMN_NAME'. Having the error type, and fields in error would allow the client to nicely indicate which input was in error, and the error message. I guess I could try passing the error message, to get the info that I need (obviously that would not be a nice solution.) Does anyone know of a good way to extract the column in error from the exception?
I have a Java project using the Spring MVC framework and Maven as its build system. The primary IDE I wish to use is Eclipse for Java EE. I am using a standard Maven project structure for my application: source code is in src/main/java, resources for the application are in src/main/resources and code related to the web container are in src/main/webapp. In src/main/webapp/WEB-INF, I have a web.xml file for configuring my server and multiple folders for Spring-related files, such as context XML files and views. These Spring files are linked to legally in web.xml. When I try to run the project using the Maven-Tomcat7-Plugin (via the mvn tomcat7:run-war goal), my project launches successfully and I am able to view my web pages and see my REST controller in action without issue. However, when I try to run the project in Eclipse, using its Run As Server option, it never works and I have no idea why not. I keep getting an error dialog box titles Server Error and with the message The selection cannot be run on any server. I have already configured a Tomcat 7 server runtime legally in Eclipse; I can use this runtime without any problem for my other Java projects. I have tried everything that Google, Stackoverflow and blogs suggest to get an Eclipse Maven Spring project working on an Eclipse server. I've tried to delete the Eclipse project, delete the Eclipse-workspace files and reimport the project (both as a Maven project and as a regular Java project), but to no avail. I've also tried enabling the Dynamic Web Module in the Project Facets and setting the web directory to src/main/webapp, but also to no avail. I'm baffled; I've worked with Tomcat servers in Eclipse many times before but it is just not working for this specific Spring project, even though it deploys just fine on Tomcat using Maven. Does anyone have any idea what might be going wrong? Have I forgotten a trouble-shooting step? Is there something wrong with my project setup that is conflicting with what Eclipse expects in a Web Server project? Thanks in advance.
I have a web application with Myfaces 2.1.5 and RichFaces 4.1.0, etc... I used Tomcat 7 as application server. Previous week i had to change it for Tomcat 6. (I know, that 7. version is better, but i had no choice) First time i had ParseException. After this exception i got some advices, that the Expression Language (el) jar packages are missing. I copied el-impl and el-core into the WEB-INF/lib folder. The first error was fixed, but i got new problems. I got the following exception: javax.servlet.ServletException: javax.el.ELResolver.invoke(Ljavax/el/ELContext;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Class;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object; javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet.service(FacesServlet.java:229) java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.el.ELResolver.invoke(Ljavax/el/ELContext;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Class;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object; com.sun.el.parser.AstValue.invoke(AstValue.java:228) com.sun.el.MethodExpressionImpl.invoke(MethodExpressionImpl.java:297) org.apache.myfaces.view.facelets.el.ContextAwareTagMethodExpression.invoke(ContextAwareTagMethodExpression.java:96) org.apache.myfaces.application.ActionListenerImpl.processAction(ActionListenerImpl.java:72) javax.faces.component.UICommand.broadcast(UICommand.java:120) javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot._broadcastAll(UIViewRoot.java:1013) javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot.broadcastEvents(UIViewRoot.java:284) javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot._process(UIViewRoot.java:1302) javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot.processApplication(UIViewRoot.java:745) org.apache.myfaces.lifecycle.InvokeApplicationExecutor.execute(InvokeApplicationExecutor.java:38) org.apache.myfaces.lifecycle.LifecycleImpl.executePhase(LifecycleImpl.java:170) org.apache.myfaces.lifecycle.LifecycleImpl.execute(LifecycleImpl.java:117) javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet.service(FacesServlet.java:197) What is the problem?

The situation: We migrated to new workstations. I copied all of my workspaces over. On the old workstation, I had both RAD 7.5 (based on Eclipse 3.4) and Eclipse 4.3. On the new workstation, I have only RAD 8.5 (based on Eclipse 3.6). So far, the only problem I've had has been when I opened an Eclipse 4.3 workspace in RAD 8.5 and I discovered that Content Assist simply doesn't work. I can type this. and wait, and then nothing happens for a few seconds, and then the little red underline appears under the text. I can hit Ctrl+Space and the content-assist window appears - and it's empty! What's interesting is that the legacy-RAD 7.5 workspaces don't have this problem - it only happens with the workspaces that were created with Eclipse 4.3. I've tried using the "Restore Defaults" button in the Preferences page, I've tried exporting preferences from my legacy-RAD 7.5 workspaces and importing to my legacy-Eclipse 4.3 workspaces, but content assist still doesn't work. I'm guessing that there's some piece of meta-data that needs to be recreated by RAD 8.5 but I'm not sure which one that is... Does anyone have any suggestions?
Quite a few people in our dev team (size 20ish java devs) are experiencing the seemingly well-known "Unhandled event loop exception" when we click between editors and other panes within the Eclipse window. Some people have had some success by installing the WindowBuilder plugin and setting the WB editor as their default editor for Java files, but most of us still get the error regularly. It doesn't seem memory related because you can get it straight away after a cold boot; i.e. it doesn't "work for a while". I think it's likely video-related, because we also get similar video glitch symptoms that have been reported by others, e.g. tab names disappearing until you hover over them etc. Our video card (most of us I think) is AMD Radeon HD 6450 and we're running 64-bit Windows 7. I've tried shutting down various processes that sound related to the video card, but to no avail. The error is reproducible on a brand new standard Eclipse J2EE install. I've searched a lot on this because it affects our day-to-day work so much, but I can't find a solution. Is there something I'm not doing that could workaround this? Here's my eclipse config exported. And as requested, here's the stack trace from the Error Log. I've also pasted the Session Data at the top of that one. BTW, the system is running a Core I7 3.4ghz CPU, and I have 16gb ram. eclipse.buildId=4.3.0.M20130911-1000 java.version=1.7.0_51 java.vendor=Oracle Corporation BootLoader constants: OS=win32, ARCH=x86_64, WS=win32, NL=en_AU Command-line arguments: -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86_64 org.eclipse.swt.SWTError: No more handles at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:4423) at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:4312) at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:4283) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.error(Widget.java:472) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control.createHandle(Control.java:704) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label.createHandle(Label.java:199) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control.createWidget(Control.java:744) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control.(Control.java:112) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label.(Label.java:101)
While debugging my Android application I wanted to jump over (skip) part of the code that is causing exceptions, but is it in the middle of a method implementation. After failing to find something useful from the menus, I decided to look into stackoverflow and I just found that there is no way to do exactly this - you can comment out code, add some 'skip' variables that you can set to true during debugging and that code will be skipped. However, in my previous experience with C, skipping part of the code was feature supported by all of the debuggers I have used, and I think that in general it was changing the program counter to point to the new line that I want to be executed. Obviously this is not possible in Java, but I couldn't find anywhere an answer why it is not possible. So can someone elaborate on this?
I ran into a problem with Solr going OutOfMemory. The situation is as follows. We had 2 Amazon EC2 small instances (3.5G) each running a Spring/BlazeDS backend in Tomcat 6 (behind a loadbalancer). Each instance has its own local Solr instance. The index size on disk is about 500M. The JVM settings were since months (Xms=512m,Xmx=768). We use Solr to find people based on properties they entered in their profile and documents they uploaded. We're not using the Solr update handler, only the select. Updates are done using deltaImports. The Spring app in each Tomcat instance has a job that triggers the /dataimport?command=delta-import handler every 30 seconds. This worked well for months, even for over a year if I'm correct (I'm not that long on the project). CPU load was at a minimum, with exceptionally some peaks. The past week we suddenly had OutOfMemory crashes of SOLR on both machines. I reviewed my changes over the past few weeks, but none of the seamed related to SOLR. Bugfixes in the UI, something email related, but again: nothing in the SOLR schema or queries. Today, we changed the Ec2 instances to m1.large (7.5G) and the SOLR JVM settings to -Xms=2048 / -Mmx=3072. This helped a bit, they run for 3 a 4 hours, but eventually, they crash too. Oh, and the dataset (number of rows, documents, entities, etc) did not change significantly. There is a constant growth, but it doesn't make sense to me when I triple the JVM memory, that it still crashes... The question: have you any directions to point me to?
I have researched this and none of the solutions that I have seen have fixed my error. What is happening is I tried to install Java EE version got the above error and then found out that I must install Java SE first. So I installed Java SE and set the JAVA_HOME variable to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0 which is where I installed my JDK. I also put C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin in my PATH variable. Still not working. I also tried the JAVA_HOME variable with C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin and that didn't work. I also tried installing without the PATH variable being updated to where I put my JDK. I'm really getting confused as to why this is happening. I've had Java before and I don't recall having this much trouble installing it. Thanks for any help that you can give :) PS I don't install from the command line I just click the download icon in Firefox and then click the download.
I currently try to run an integration test with maven failsafe, like described in here: reference link . For this, I got 3 Modules: datamodule, datamodule2 and testmodule (all covered by a parent pom). testmodule depends on the two other modules. It got an test in src/test/java/ named MyTestIT.java. If I try to run the test with mvn clean test failsafe:integration-test, everything runs fine, but if I only run mvn failsafe:integration-test, it does not work. Does somebody know how it's this way? If I try to run the test with surefire, for example with mvn test -Dtest=MyTestIT, it says it can't find MyTestIT in datamodule, and I need to set -DfailIfNoTests=false. If I try to run it with mvn test --pl testmodule, it says it can't find the dependencies (this only happens when they are not installed, but I don't want to call install everytime I run a test). Is there any way of setting this in a pom, either in the parent pom or in the project pom? Or any other way of saying to maven "only run the integration tests, use the right dependencies and do not install everything"?
I have a multi module maven project JAR module A JAR module B depends on A WAR module C depends on B Each of the modules has three types of tests. Unit tests that don't depend on any external resources being present Database integration tests that only depend on external database being present REST api tests that depend on the application running in tomcat before they can run I would like maven to execute the tests in the following order. All unit tests for modules A,B,C All database tests for modules A,B,C All REST api tests for module A,B,C I know how to use the surefire and the failsafe plugins to separate the unit tests from the integration tests. However i don't know how to make the failsafe plugin split the integration tests into two groups the database tests and the rest api tests. How can the failsafe plugin be configured to split integration tests into groups that can be run separately? All tests are written with TestNG.
I want to jar class files while skipping the error. The reason is i have a sdk jar file which i decompiled and the classes have alot of errors,however the sdk still works. I want to edit the decompiled class files with log comments so that i can see which functions are being called and then jar the class files (skip the errors). currently when i jar a file with error, it jars (eclipse > export jar), however when there is error in the class files, below is the message written in my class files in jar. Steps to jar the file: Created a java project (Java SE 1.6) put the classes in the src package, Export the project as jar file Please let me know if it is possile <Unresolved compilation problems: The import android cannot be resolved The import android cannot be resolved The import sg cannot be resolved The import sg cannot be resolved The import sg cannot be resolved Context cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Context cannot be resolved to a type Context cannot be resolved to a type Log cannot be resolved Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type CardType cannot be resolved to a variable Domain cannot be resolved to a variable Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Log cannot be resolved Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Log cannot be resolved Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Log cannot be resolved Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Log cannot be resolved Log cannot be resolved Connector cannot be resolved to a type Connector cannot be resolved to a type Log cannot be resolved

I have a somewhat baffling issue running a webapp in Apache Tomcat. After deploying the page works fine, but sometime during the day, a page inevitably fails to compile. The issue is not with the page itself, the page changes daily, which page seems to be determined by the order/frequency of access. If nobody has accessed the log page during the day, that's the page that will break down. If the log page has been accessed, it will keep on working until the next deploy, but another page page will break down. By break down i mean: http://codepad.org/V1yosH8k (jsp, more prevailant) Stacktrace: http://codepad.org/P9VpXBRW (java) ClassNotFoundException/NoClassDefFoundError: Obviously the class does exist, it works fine if accessed early after deploy. It happens on the live server, but am unable to reproduce it on my dev machine. Running apache tomcat 6 with JAVA_OPTS "-Xms1024m -Xmx1900m -XX:NewSize=256m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m -XX:PermSize=768m -XX:MaxPermSize=768m" Anyone able to give me a push in the right direction?
I am learning to code in java, and using Eclipse, the android IDE as my code writing program. Whenever I create a new project, there is always a red exclamation mark on the icon for the main folder of my project in the project explorer section on the left side of the screen. Also, whenever I create a new class file, some of the code has an error in it, even when it shouldn't. One example of this is when I add the main method, with this code: public static void main(String[] args) I get the error "String cannot be resolved to a type". There is also an automatically generated line of code at the beginning of the class which has an error in it: public class Class is giving me the error: "Implicit super constructor Object() is undefined for default constructor. Must define an explicit constructor" there is a red dotted line under the word "Class" in the code, so I assume its trying to tell me that's where the error is. I am also getting an error in the code System.out.println();saying "System cannot be resolved". I was able to create an integer without getting an error using this code: int number = 3; I was able to use all this code mentioned above without getting an error before, I don't know what's wrong... Could I have changed some settings or something? screenshot of eclipse
I recently updated to jre8. It seem that the present security settings are really nasty. I am unable to run javadb I get the following error Mon Mar 31 02:04:54 IST 2014 : Security manager installed using the Basic server security policy. Mon Mar 31 02:04:54 IST 2014 : access denied ("java.net.SocketPermission" "localhost:1527" "listen,resolve") java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.net.SocketPermission" "localhost:1527" "listen,resolve") what are the steps taken by me changed the permission in java.policy file to listen to 1527 (also added resolve)-but to no avail this is what http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-known-issues-2157115.html gives out Bug 8030961 Area: Java DB Synopsis An additional permission may be needed to bring up the Java DB network server. In particular, the startup scripts in may fail to boot the network server. While attempting to boot, the network server may fail and raise the following error: access denied ("java.net.SocketPermission" "localhost:1527" "listen,resolve") java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.net.SocketPermission" "localhost:1527" "listen,resolve") To fix this problem, you must bring up the network server with a security policy that includes the missing permission. Instead of booting the network server as: java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start boot the network server as follows: java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=${yourPolicyFile} org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start where ${yourPolicyFile} is a file containing a customized version of the policy file described in the Java DB Admin Guide section titled Basic Network Server security policy. You must customize that generic policy file to fit your application. In addition, you must add the following permission to the permissions block granted to the ${derby.install.url}derbynet.jar codebase: permission java.net.SocketPermission "localhost:${port}", "listen"; where ${port} should be replaced by the port number where the network server listens for incoming connection requests. By default, that is port 1527. now I exactly not sure what to do *do I need to do any additional stuff *found derbynet.jar ( as an executable jar file) how do I edit, what do I edit Thanks,
I need to define a set of functions as part of an interface for a public facing SDK and trying to figure out the best way of signalling to the caller code if something was successful or not, and if not, why not. My first consideration was return value vs exception. I think I need to use a combination of both for this one. Exceptions for erroneous states/errors caused by bugs. Return value to be used for times when function ran as expected and just want to return the result of the call to the caller. Now, for return type. I could use ints (flags) or booleans. It has been argued internally that booleans should be used as it is simpler, and no need for flags. Booleans limit you to specifying success or failure, with no explanation. I would make two arguments for using flags instead. First, you can return more than two possible values. Allowing for { success, fail, fail_reason_1, fail_reason_2, fail_reason_3 }. Note as this is an interface for implementations on various hardware devices it is probably desirable to be able to notify why an operation failed. e.g. the connected device doesn't support beep, has no LCD, doesn't support embedded crypto etc. Who knows what the requirements will be in the future. Returning a bool locks you in now, whereas using flags allows you greater flexibility in the future. So what if you never need more than two values in the future. At least you have the option. Considering this will be a public facing SDK I want as much flexibility so as to prevent breaking changes in the future. Thanks
There is this warning I regularly encounter when working with Java/Eclipse/Maven/OSGi: The JRE container on the classpath is not a perfect match to the 'JavaSE-1.6' execution environment I am on a Java 7 JDK. Most project require (rightly so I think) a lower version than that. For example they will require JavaSE-1.6 or JavaSE-1.5. So in their MANIFEST.MF, these projects will have an entry that looks like this (sample taken from a bundle project of mine): Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: JavaSE-1.6 This will give me the mentioned warning. Now, I know of two possible ways to 'solve' this warning: Replace the current runtime environment for the project with a Java 6 runtime Change the MANIFEST entry to JavaSE-1.7 Both 'solutions' seem completely ludicrous to me. My project does not require JavaSE-1.7. It runs perfectly fine on JavaSE-1.6. Requiring all users of the bundle to have at least Java 7, just because the developer was on Java 7 and did not like the warning seems to me to be the opposite of what you would want. On the other hand, requiring me as a developer to have all versions of Java installed that are listed as required execution environment on projects I work with seems to be almost just as ludicrous. All these projects run perfectly fine on Java 7 so why would I need to have many of them? Am I completely missing something (in which case I am not the only one), or is this warning really stupid as it is actively promoting developers to set a much higher required execution environment for their projects as would be strictly needed?? Any insight (and hopefully a third way to get rid of this warning) would be greatly appreciated.
Is anyone having a problem running a Windows Service with JavaExe, and is there a solution? The JavaExe examples all work except for the Service examples, Example3, Example5, and Example23. In each case, the Windows Service gets created, but any attempt to start the service brings a popup error message: "The system cannot find the file specified." There is a registry entry for the serivce which contains the following: Name: ImagePath Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ Data: "\JavaExe\JavaExe\doc\examples\3 - Service\Example3.exe" __RunService__ If I run Example3.exe from a command line with the argument __RunService__, then a Java process starts and runs briefly before crashing. The examples are all self-contained in the JavaExe download, so it's hard to see how there could be missing libraries. Background: JavaExe (http://devwizard.free.fr/html/en/JavaExe.html) appears to implement a sound approach to allowing a Java application program to be invoked from another Java program running as a service. Windows prevents services from accessing the desktop, so JavaExe sets up a socket connection between the service and the application Java program, each running as a User process, as outlined here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683502(v=vs.85).aspx Windows 7 x64 (but it fails in the same way on XP [SEE UPDATE BELOW]) Java version 1.7.0_45 -- UPDATE: The developer replied to my email and advised that 32-bit and 64-bit Java versions were being confused. I straightened this out. The Example3 Service, run from the .exe and .jar files obtained from the JavaExe .zip download (which are all 32 bit by default), now run correctly on WinXP (x86). For x64 machines, it is necessary to recompile the jar files using the package's compilx64.bat script. (And to use the x64 versions of JaveExe.exe as stated in the documentation.) I did these things but the Example3 service still fails to start, with the error, "The system cannot find the file specified." The .jar files built from compilx64.bat are mostly identical to the x86 versions, but a few contain .class files that are a few bytes larger. I assume that the code must therefore be referring to native libraries? And maybe some are not found? But which ones? When I type sc qc Example3 I get: TYPE: : 10 WIN32_OWN_PROCESS START_TYPE: 2 AUTO_START ERROR_CONTROL: 1 NORMAL BINARY_PATH_NAME : "[...filepath...]\JavaExe\JavaExe\doc\examples\3 - Service\Example3.exe" __RunService__ LOAD_ORDER_GROUP: 0 DISPLAY_NAME: JavaExe : Example3 DEPENDENCIES: eventlog SERVICE_START_NAME: LocalSystem
I started developing a game in Java with Eclipse. As you all know you have to debug a lot while coding. But I have the following issue: My game is full-screen. If I run into a breakpoint it stops (like it should) and for some reason I can't switch window anymore (I am using Windows 7). I have to press Ctrl + Alt + Delete" and start the "Task manager" to be able to switch to Eclipse window and continue debugging. So I tried to use window mode instead of full screen. Now if I run into a breakpoint the Eclipse window gets the focus (automatically) and I can debug easily. So I thought it would be great to be in window mode, if and only if I am in debug mode, else it should be full screen. For this I need to know if I am in debug mode or not. After reading this and this it seems like you can't check that easily, cause it depends on the VM you are using. Also it seems like the best solution is to use the Eclipse Debug/Run-Configuration and set a VM or program argument. But how can I tell Eclipse to use this configuration only for debug mode? Or is there even a better way to determine, if debug is on or off?
I work daily on a large customized version of Android. Our work involves creating new APIs and testing them with our in-house test app. Currently, each person checks out the needed files to make API updates and then requests that I create a new version of the test app that works with their changes. The way I accomplish this, in part, is with a script that grabs their version of the OS files (the ones that declare the APIs) and generates a JAR of these files that is then thrown in the test app's "lib" directory so the test code can reference these new/changed APIs. I've been able to automate so much of my workflow, but I can't find a way to automate the task of generating the jar from a few .java files that can't be compiled in isolation. I know how to create a jar and manually populate it, but I can't figure out how Eclipse is able to generate .class files for .java input source files that can't be compiled by themselves. The only way that I can currently compile these files is with a multi-hour full OS build, which I don't want to wait on. Also, our build servers don't spit out the individual .class files I would want to zip up in a JAR anyways. So, does anyone know how to generate a JAR file with .class files compiled from .java src files that appear, by themselves, to be riddled with errors? I currently do this manually with Eclipse's "export project to JAR" ability, but it really irks me that it's the only "non-automate-able" step in my process so far. I found this, which doesn't handle generation of the .class file(s) from a set of .java files that won't compile alone. Thanks!
So I have a project that works totally fine in one workspace on my machine. I push it to the repository so everyone else can work on it. I go to pull it down making sure all the changes are good. I import the project into a new workspace and using eclipse with autobuild on it produces no errors. I go to the command line and run ant clean release on the project and right before it gets to run crunch on the assets the build fails with a mulitple dex files define error. Ive checked the project high and low and compared to the other copy of it in the original workspace but for what ever reason I cant get it to build. I erase the bin and gen folders and remove all the imports and basically leave just the project, run clean in eclipse, and still get a dex define error related to one of the lib projects classes. Ive tried to find where extra copies could be but I dont find anything. googling around for the past few days hasnt helped as the normal solutions to such a problem havent worked for me. So what is the best way to figure out where the extra class definitions are coming from so I can get rid of them and fix the repository so I can use it correctly. I have a feeling its related to one of the files in the project that I should be excluding in my gitignore but Im not sure which that would be. Any help on the matter would be greatly appreciated cause this has eaten quite a bit of time of just messing around.
I've tried debugging my application in Android Studio/Eclipse and both yield same result, very slow debugging (1-15 frames per second) with my samsung note3. The funny part is that without a debugger attached to the application, the application runs just fine (60 frames per second). I've removed all break points in Android Studio (installed today from scratch), same with eclipse, both yield same behavior. I've recreated the existing application project a few times, with no luck. I've also removed all expressions as well, no luck. I've done method tracing with and without a debugger. The times/invocation counts look very similar and there isn't any obvious outliers. The moment I turn off debugging, the application instantly goes back up to 60fps. I'm going to ask my friend to try it on his device (an htc phone) and see if he can reproduce. I should mention, I do think that somehow I'm causing extra overhead with the debugger with my application, cause I created a simple open gl surface, and it debugged just fine. I should also mention, I've tried 3 different usb cords, and all yield same result. My app is multi threaded and makes use of large object pools. Any ideas?
I am using Spring. I have an several endpoints in my application. Basically, each endpoint return a different object. The application consists in several layers. It is important to us , no matter where an error occurs , to propagate the errors to the caller of the endpoints. Our approach It is to throw an exception where the error happens , and it should be caught up in the endpoint , and the endpoint should change the status codes of the response according to the information in the exception. We catch up the exception, because we don't want to throw soap faults to the caller we have come to a point in the architecture, we don't want the endpoint to manage the exception. We think t should be done in some kind of interceptor or by AOP. The important It is that at that "outer exception handling component" I could get the exception fully and its attribute and based on that , no matter , what endpoint was called, get the return type object of the endpoint and return it by filling some appropriate fields based on the exception, possibly by some java reflection My first approach was to use a SOAP interceptor, but I think it is limited according to what I need. I am doing research on AOP , any ideas?
I have a Java application that runs on Tomcat on Linux. After running for several weeks, it starts taking close to 100% CPU (as displayed by 'top' command), but none of the Java threads takes more than 5% CPU; it's not kernel CPU either (that one is between 0.2-0.5%). So something else (native code? JVM itself?) is causing this high CPU usage. The problem can only be solved by restarting Tomcat. So the question is: is there the way to find out what is causing this high CPU usage, if not Java threads? Is there a way to "look at" native libraries running inside Java process. Or what should be my debugging strategy in this case? Versions: Linux 2.6 (CentOS), Apache Tomcat/6.0.33, JVM: Sun 1.6.0_29-b11. The application happens to be Forgerock OpenAM 10.0 (I am checking known issues on their end too, but so far didn't find the exact match, so looking for more generic suggestions)
We have been trying to build a simple web application using Tomcat and the Websockets. The system is functional on localhost. The problem started when we tried to deploy the web application on the Server (Debian Linux, running Tomcat 7.0.52). The application runs perfectly fine on localhost (Windows 7, running Tomcat 7.0.52). Methods suggested so far for error 500 have been mainly to check the jars in the lib folder of the tomcat. (That weirdly doesn't seem to be the issue as all the jars seems to be present in the lib folder. I even extracted un-jarred the wesocket jar and checked if the class UpgradeUtil was present. It was!). We get this error when accessing the site from the browser.

I'm creating a utility function that returns a Method object given all its pieces. Its parameters: return type (Class<?>) containing class (Class<?>[]) function name (String) parameter-class array (Class<?>[]) Notice the containing-class parameter is an array. Exactly one of those classes must contain the method, but you can't know which one. It's a way for default classes to be specified, in addition to the one that may be explicitly specified. My goal is to search each class in this array, in order, and if it contains that method, return its Method object. I would like to do this without having to try-catch for NoSuchMethodException (as described in this question). Since the method may be private, using Class.getMethods() is not possible. (It also allows for private static, but I'm not sure that if that affects this question.) How do you search for a private method in this way? How do you make a "does function exist in class" test, without having to use a NoSuchMethodException as the "false" logic? More information: https://www.google.com/search?q=class+contains+method+java
So just started this unit and answered a couple questions outta my book. Do my answers show proper understanding of exceptions and try-catch blocks? Wanted to verify this before i start working with try-catch blocks/exceptions :) What classes (and their subclasses) are examples of unchecked exceptions? Answer: IOExceptions, ClassNotFoundException, RuntimeException (its subclasses: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, IllegalArgumentException What are the two different ways that a programmer can deal with checked exceptions to avoid compil Answer: Use either a try-catch block or declare the exception in the method header beforehand. Describe the steps that occur when an exception is not caught in the current method Answer: If an exception is not caught in the current method, Java exits this method, passes the exception to the method that invoke the method, and continues the same process to find a handler. If no handler found in the chain of methods being invoked, then the program terminates and prints an error message on the console. (ths process of finding the ‘handler’ is called catching and exception. How is a ‘chained exception’ different from an exception that has been rethrown? Answer: A rethrown exception occurs when the handler cannot process the exception or simply wants to let its caller be notified of the exception. A chained exception is when you throw an exception along with another exception. Syntax for rethrowing exception: throw ex(ex = object reference) Syntax for chained exception: throw new Exception(“message…”, ex);
I'm considering setting up a RabbitMQ broker to handle basic task processing for a java web application. The basic idea is that the producer is a web server that wants to be speedy about processing requests, but also needs to do some data processing. To accomplish this, it knows about some Job DTOs that can be serialized to AMQP messages, and somewhere out there is a consumer that knows how to process these jobs. Classic. After reading the RabbitMQ documentation, I'm still left with a couple of questions. I want the consumer application to fully utilize its CPU for processing messages, and I'm wondering if RabbitMQ already provides the worker pool. Assuming I wanted 4 worker threads, is it enough to register 4 channels with 1 consumer each on the same connection? In that case, work would be done in handleDelivery() and an ack would be sent if it successfully completes. Or rather, should I use 1 consumer and manage a pool of workers at my own layer of the application? Consumers will be talking to the database, which means transient errors will occur; deadlocks, optimistic locking violations, database server restarts, and so on. What is the intended behavior if a consumer can't process a job? Issue a nack and wait for the broker to resend the job, or delay the ack until it's certain that the job can't be completed? Or does it not matter? It's worth noting that jobs generally won't take longer than a few seconds unless the database is restarting or something. I appreciate any guidance!
I am developing a JavaFX 2.2 application where background threads may trigger an error dialog to show until its close button is pressed. If other background threads trigger message dialogs that are not as urgent as the error, these dialogs must not be placed on top of the error dialog. In other words, I want an error dialog that blocks everything else, and that is never hidden by other popups, or by the main window. I have tried setting modality to APPLICATION_MODAL for the error dialog, and WINDOW_MODAL for the other, lesser dialogs, but lesser dialogs still appear above the error dialog if they are triggered while the error dialog is showing. I am not in a position where I can use Java 8, so DialogsFx and ControlFx and other libraries are out of the question. In Swing, I used to use layers a log, like POPUP_LAYER, ALERT_LAYER, ERROR_LAYER, but I can't find anything similar in JavaFx. Regards, Fredrik
I'm reading the Fowler book on Refactoring. In chapter 2 in the changing interfaces section. I don't understand this passage: There is one particular area with problems in changing interfaces in Java: adding an exception to the throws clause. This is not a change in signature, so you cannot use delegation to cover it. The compiler will not let it compile, however. It is tough to deal with this problem. You can choose a new name for the method, let the old method call it, and convert the checked into an unchecked exception. You can also throw an unchecked exception, although then you lose the checking ability. When you do this, you can alert your callers that the exception will become a checked exception at a future date. They then have some time to put the handlers into their code. For this reason I prefer to define a superclass exception for a whole package (such as SQLException for java.sql) and ensure that public methods only declare this exception in their throws clause. That way I can define subclass exceptions if I want to, but this won't affect a caller who knows only about the general case. Could someone explain with an example? Thanks a ton!
I've got a Spring REST application that is using Spring Security. So far, I've been doing error handling using a @ControllerAdvice class which is great to handle all errors thrown during the MVC process. However, all exceptions thrown by Spring Security (ex: AccessDeniedException) are not handled by MVC error handling as they never actually make it to the MVC components. So if I want to handle Spring Security exceptions, I have to either add an AccessDeniedHandler or use a custom filter placed after the EXCEPTION_TRANSLATION_FILTER (see Spring Docs and Filter Ordering). My main goal in handling my exceptions is that I want to return a consistent response to the client no matter the error being throw with pertinent information embedded in a JSON object (ex: Timestamp, error code, message, etc). Is there a preferred technique for this kind of setup? Or a better way of being able to centralize everything? I love the simplicity of MVC error handling with @ExceptionHandlers but everything seems to push me towards using a custom filter and handle everything in one location. On a related note, it seems to me that the default FilterChain that is generated by using namespace configuration is overkill for a REST application. Is there a more appropriate configuration for a REST application? (Ex: no need for the FORM_LOGIN_FILTER, REMEMBER_ME_FILTER, CONCURRENT_SESSION_FILTER, etc...). Does anyone have a list of the filters that should be used in a REST application? I cannot find anything in the docs.
I have set the following properties:- Set environment variables JAVA_HOME,path,ANT_HOME,path (using JDK version --> jdk1.7.0_40) In Eclipse set the system Library, added all needed jars and select all jars in Order and Export. Install the Firefox Version 24 and used the Selenium jar(selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0). Giving no error while running the Java application, also no exception while not able to click on particular element. sendKeys(Keys.ENTER) is working fine, but instead I need to use click() method. Also code is working fine on other systems, I think I am missing something. click() method is not giving any valid response, it makes me feel like its only declared not defined. I have tried on different websites, on different elements and with different types(xpath, css selector, name, id) but nothing worked for me. I took focus on that element by webdriver and also by highlighting the element using javascript code, its showing that particular element is present. I have performed other operations like entering username after clicking on that element, its performing well. I have worked with different browsers, different webpages also maximize the window using selenium but no positive response. Any help will appreciate. Thanks in advance
Sorry if this question is kind of vague. Let me know if I can provide any additional relevant details. Basically, every so often (at least once every few weeks), when I open my Eclipse workspace I am greeted with a large number of errors. It often says that almost every single one of my projects have errors even though they were working just the day before. I understand that something is getting messed up in the build-path because it gives me errors such as The type java.lang.Object cannot be resolved. However, I don't understand why restarting Eclipse would cause this build-path to get messed up. It also seems fairly common for me to get errors on imports for various Android classes even though I have included the Android SDK in the project. I guess what I am asking is twofold: 1) Why is this happening and is there anything that I can do to stop this from happening? 2) When this does happen, is there an easy way that I can resolve it? I know that I can go into the Preferences for an individual project and add libraries to the build-path but I can't figure out how to easily do this for all of my projects at once, and I feel like I'm just trying things until they work, so it would be good to have a more defined procedure for dealing with these sorts of problems. EDIT: Does anyone have any ideas?
I know this question is being asked before Limit CsvListReader to one line i am facing the same issue, can you please tell me what changes made to tokenizer to overcome this issue... In my case it is occurring in different line number everytime, it is not consistent.sometimes it occurs at line 5000 of csv and some other time it occur at 6000 if i go into debug mode and step on the code one by one than it never occurs. Can you help me with what could be the issue. pardon me for asking the same question again, but i can't seem to find a solution on my own. one of the CSV line at which it throws the error is the "???" is the Japanese text "CI","1","2014-04-01","BMW","","","","","","3","528","",0,0,"","","C","","","1","F","1"," 8"," 8",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","0301","BMW","","7","","5","","5","","8","7","5","5","8","","","","","","","","0","0","???","BMW","???","???","???","???","???","???","???","???","","","","","","","","","","","","","???","BMW","???","???","???","???","???","???","???","???","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",0,0,0,"0","0","0","2014-04-02","09:34:35","90002","082R" other is this "CI","1","2014-04-01","BMW","","","","","","3","633","",0,0,"","","C","","","1","F","1"," 8"," 8",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","0301","BMW","","7","","4","","5","","8","7","4","5","8","","","","","","","","0","0","???","BMW","???","???","???","???","???","???","???","???","","","","","","","","","","","","","???","BMW","???","???","???","???","???","???","???","???","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",0,0,0,"0","0","0","2014-04-02","09:34:35","15762","082R" This line seems to be properly formated but yet it throws the error Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.expandCapacity(AbstractStringBuilder.java:99) at java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.append(AbstractStringBuilder.java:575) at java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:204) at org.supercsv.io.Tokenizer.readColumns(Tokenizer.java:106) at org.supercsv.io.AbstractCsvReader.readRow(AbstractCsvReader.java:179) at org.supercsv.io.CsvListReader.read(CsvListReader.java:69)
I was able to install Tomcat and solr, and I can view the solr dashboard at SERVERIP:8080/solr Next, I am trying to access MySQL via solr so that I can start indexing some data. I added the following lines to my solrconfig.xml file just under the <config> tag: <requestHandler name="/dataimport" class="org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.DataImportHandler"> <lst name="defaults"> <str name="config">data-config.xml</str> </lst> </requestHandler> My data-config.xml file looks like this: <dataConfig> <dataSource type="JdbcDataSource" driver="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/my_database" user="my_username" password="my_password" /> <document> <entity name="user" query="select id, first_name, last_name from user;"> <field column="id" name="id"/> <field column="first_name" name="first_name"/> <field column="last_name" name="last_name"/> </entity> </document> </dataConfig> However, when I restart Tomcat, I get a long error message. Here are the first few lines: HTTP Status 500 - {msg=SolrCore 'collection1' is not available due to init failure: RequestHandler init failure,trace=org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: SolrCore 'collection1' is not available due to init failure: RequestHandler init failure at org.apache.solr.core.CoreContainer.getCore(CoreContainer.java:827) at org.apache.solr.servlet.SolrDispatchFilter.doFilter(SolrDispatchFilter.java:317) at ... Does anyone know where I would even start to debug this error? Some other threads suggest that this may be a file permission error, but I have double-checked that the solr directory is writeable.
It's a general question, which raised from specific scenario, but I'd like to get a general answer how to deal with the following situation: Background: I have an app, which is using some 3rd party library (ad network provider SDK - specifically - AdMob SDK, based on Google Play Services). Functionality of this library is not critical for the application. The library creates one or more background worker threads. Sometimes (very rare case) there is an unhandled exception in one of these background threads, causing to crashing the application. I'd like to ignore all exceptions, caused by this library, regardless of their cause: in worst case the app user will not see an ad - it's much better than app crash. Since the library itself creates the background threads - I cannot just wrap them by try/catch. Question Is there any way to catch all non-handled background (non-main) thread exceptions and just to kill the thread in such case, and to prevent app crash? Related questions I saw a lot of several questions, but some of them are too specific (and not covering my case), others refer to situation when the developer has a control on thread creation and is able to wrap the whole thread with try/catch. If I still missed the relevant question, covering this case, I will appreciate the link

I am running tests on Selenium grid - usually 5 machines running tests in parallel. I am getting some odd errors that aren't consistent. For example, one of my tests with about 600 iterations will finish with 0-50 of the 3 errors below. The number is different every time I run it. For each exception, the line it fails on is always the same. org.openqa.selenium.UnsupportedCommandException: Command duration or timeout: 65.91 seconds com.web.test.library.BaseTest.openUrl(BaseTest.java:45) Line #45 in BaseTest: remoteDriver.get(url); org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Error forwarding the new session Error forwarding the request Read timed out Command duration or timeout: 134.11 seconds com.web.test.utility.DriverFactory.generateDriver(DriverFactory.java:46) Line #46 in DriverFactory: WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver("my hub url here", capabilities); org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Unable to bind to locking port 7054 within 45000 ms com.web.test.utility.DriverFactory.generateDriver(DriverFactory.java:46) Line #46 in DriverFactory: WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver("my hub url here", capabilities); When I search for these errors online the fixes only help when this error is stopping every test. I can't find anything when it happens inconsistently like this. For example, the fix I found for #1 requires editing the host file. I don't think that is the problem in my case since it works ~95% of the time.

I need to consume a web service in my project. I use NetBeans so I right-clicked on my project and tried to add a new "Web Service Client". Last time I checked, this was the way to create a web service client. But it resulted in an AssertionError, saying: java.lang.AssertionError: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; systemId: jar:file:/path/to/glassfish/modules/jaxb-osgi.jar!/com/sun/tools/xjc/reader/xmlschema/bindinfo/binding.xsd; lineNumber: 52; columnNumber: 88; schema_reference: Failed to read schema document 'xjc.xsd', because 'file' access is not allowed due to restriction set by the accessExternalSchema property. The default Java platform for NetBeans was JDK8 (Oracle's official version), so when I changed my netbeans.conf file and made JDK7 (from Oracle, as well) as my default, everything worked fine. So I think the problem is with JDK8. Here is my java -version output: java version "1.8.0" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0-b132) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.0-b70, mixed mode) For now, I'm keeping JDK7 as my default Java platform. If there is a way to make JDK8 work please share. Thanks in advance.
1) So far whenever I create android project, I get a java main class which extends activity, and an XML file... that's it, but now after recently upgrading my android eclipse, whenever I create a project the main java file extends action bar activity instead of just activity and a fragment class is also created with the XML file, and on top of all this a new folder appcompat_v7 gets created automatically with red cross as an indication of error over it, I am new to android development and all this stuff stopping me from continue, as I do not know why all this is happening and how can I tackle this problem. 2) When a project is created i get this error message in my console: [appcompat_v7] WARNING: unable to write jarlist cache file C:\Users...\workspace\appcompat_v7\bin\jarlist.cache Any suggestions on how solve such problems and what is wrong with my android eclipse highly appreciated
For those that dislike reading long sentences: I would like to preface this by noting that I have a specific question here related to eclipse debugger source lookup in conjunction with remote debugging. In order to provide a more localized picture of what I am experiencing and why this information is relevant, I provide the background context below. Knowing that the average SO'er is quite lazy and will probably down-vote this immediately, I urge you to read the actual question. You might find that it is not as broad or localized as you had thought. Background info: I have this java framework that is meant to run external scripts. To do this, I use a combination of a classloader and the system java compiler to compile .java "script" files that DO NOT exist on my project's build path. All of this works, compiler black magic and all. The inherent complication with externally loaded code is the difficulty to debug. I have addressed this by using the remote debugging feature of the java runtime. So, I have a debug configuration that attaches to my executable jar, which has the directory with the external java scripts on the source lookup path. This actually WORKED for a while.Actually, it never worked properly, I just had scripts accidentally on my build path. Confusingly enough I can put breakpoints in the scripts, and the debugger actually STOPS there (consistent line number, -verbose:class logging and all). Understanding how eclipse finds the source files is something that would help, though. The majority of eclipse documentation is comprised of user manuals, after all. WHAT I SUSPECTED was that I had accidentally duplicated certain script files, and thus confused the source lookup with an out-of-sync source file. This is not the case, I have since removed the duplicated files and eclipse still is unable to find the source. What I've tried double, triple, quadruple checked the source lookup paths ensuring it includes every relevant directory enabled/disabled search subfolders enabled/disabled search duplicates using an absolute path to the directory instead of a relative workspace path Workaround The only workaround here is to add the script files onto the build path of the project, which is unacceptable for me. What I'm doing now I am slowly crawling my way through the eclipse open source project base repository looking for the answer. Eclipse, as it turns out, is a pretty big project. Question Can anyone provide an accurate algorithmic representation of how the Eclipse source lookup works? Knowing this, I could possibly figure out a way to force the Eclipse debugger to use the correct path using reflection. As far as I know, there is no technical limitation that prevents dynamically compiled code from being debugged. I know this because my breakpoints are suspending my threads as I expect them to, the source code just doesn't seem to want to load :( Related research: It seems that this might be linked with how the class is defined with a null CodeSource location, but apparently the proper thing to do when dynamically compiling code into memory is to give the null arg... the question still stands how/why this matters to eclipse's debugger. Update 4/22 3:30: So I pursued the CodeSource solution linked above. Now, I am seeing that my class IS being loaded from the proper file path location with the -verbose:class switch, but the source lookup is still failing. Breakpoints are still properly caught, but I am greeted with the familiar Source not found red lettering. Updated 5/6 3:15: I pursued the javap solution discussed in Andrew's answer. Turns out, the source file attribute in my .class bytecode exactly matches a file that WOULD exist on my source lookup path. This confuses me, because this hints towards folder hierarchy having an influence on the source lookup. However, I have created "phantom" package hierarchies representing the "true" packages(as defined at the top of my .java files) and moving my source files to those folders, but the source lookup is still failing when I add those paths to my source lookup path. Any additional insight as to what additional factors play into the source lookup would be huge.
I have a java web start app that extracts a dll from itself to a temp file, and loads it via System.load("full\path\to\dll"). That completes successfully. However, when I try to invoke the native methods in that dll, I get an UnsatisfiedLinkError with the name of the method. This is a Windows 7 box, 32 bit 1.7.0_45 (and _51) jre's. This same code works everywhere else except for some computers for 1 customer. Supposedly the accounts have no local admin permissions (that's normal) and are running Microsoft Security Center Endpoint Protection. Is there some conflict between MS EPP and java's LoadLibrary calls? My google-fu couldn't find it if there is. Or what else could explain this problem? At first the dll wasn't signed (it's never had to be before), but I tried signing it with our code signing cert to see if that had anything to do with it, but no help.

I'm trying to use my 1st PowerMockito [PowerMock + Mockito] mock in an existing JUnit test. I've narrowed down that when I simply have the presence of the class-level annotation @PrepareForTest (along with @RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class), but not any actual mocking code), I get java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javassist/NotFoundException: If I comment out the @PrepareForTest, and also any actual mocking code to eliminate confounding variables, that error does not happen; if I UN-comment just the @PrepareForTest, then the error happens. So I believe that narrows the problem down to just to do with trying to use the annotation... I have these jars on my buildpath: junit-4.11.jaar, junit-addons-1.4.jar, mockito-all-1.9.5.jar, mockito-all-1.9.5-sources.jar, powermock-mockito-1.5.4-full.jar. The powermock-mockito-1.5.4-full.jar is the only new one I added to try out PowerMockito (from https://code.google.com/p/powermock/wiki/Downloads?tm=2): It gives me everything additional I need to write the new PowerMockito mocking code without Eclipse compile errors. (I already had the other mentioned ars from previous existing JUnit & Mockito [alone, no PowerMockito] tests), What could I be doing wrong to get that error?
I have a scenario I'd like to get your input on. We've nearly decided which route we're going to take, but I'm curious what some other opinions regarding a solution are. Our program is a converter service that sits between two larger systems: System A makes a copy and sticks it on a WebSphere queue, JMS picks it up and starts our service by calling the onMessage method in the Converter class, we do some processing, give it back to JMS, and JMS sticks it on another queue to System B. We're looking at the best way to capture that input message as soon as it hits our onMessage method and hold onto it throughout our program's entire process. This way if we hit an error, we can print the message that caused said error in our stack-trace log to assist with troubleshooting. During my research, I came across four methods of obtaining this persistence: 1) Save to a temporary file. 2) Global variable/Singleton. 3) Wrapper class. 4) Spring's dependency injection methods. The solution we're leaning towards is (ominous music) using a global variable. We're using the following known facts to drive our decision: It is only a single String with a max of 1000 characters, so the memory impact is negligible. Only one class will ever have access to the setter (the Consumer class it's inside) Every other instance will only access the getter. Clearest/simplest code, easy for someone following to understand. Our service will never become multi-threaded. Only one instance of our service will run at one time on a given server. The variable will be cleared and overwritten every time a new message comes through. I know the general opinion is that global variables are very very bad, but I've always been of the opinion that global variables aren't inherently bad, they're just ridiculously easy to use in a bad way. We're of the opinion that this is the one instance where, being mindful of the dangers of global variables, they're the right choice. Your thoughts? It should be noted that we can't add any libraries to our environment, so we're stuck with whatever we can do with Java and Spring.
I have the following configuration in the eclipse Created a tomcat 7.0 server instance from the servers view. Created a sample web application and deployed in the server through maven-tomcat-plugin and tested it in the browser ( started the server by right clicking the server from the server view and selected start ) Tried to configure the remote debugging settings in the created server instance using JPDA options,i added the env variables in the server setting. i could not connect the debugger to the server when i start the server from the eclipse as like previously. But it connected seamlessly when i start the directly from the installation directory using the command prompt as like catlina.bat jpda start After that i tried this I started the server instance by ( started the server by right clicking the server from the server view and selected DEBUG mode) I got the Break points in the code and even Hot Code replacement working!!! Can anyone explain the following? What goes wrong when i tried jpda options for the remote debugging with the created server instance in the eclipse? How the debug option and Hot Code replacement works with the server instance?Is this remote debugging or something else?Can you explain on this one?
Couple days ago, I was happily coding away on my IDE, Eclipse. However, after attempting to boot it up today, i get the error in the title you see. Symptoms: - Attempting to boot up eclipse results in an error: 'Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:\Windows\system32\..\jre\bin\client\jvm.dll"' - Attempting to use 'java -version' results in an error: 'Error: could not open 'C:\Windows\jre\lib\amd64\jvm.cfg' - However, if I open cmd in the jre OR jdk folder, it allows me to check the version and use java as normal. What i've done: - double checked windows, eclipse, and jre/jdk bit versions, all 64 bit. - reinstalled eclipse and jre/jdk, doublechecking that I'm installing 64 bit versions - set my -vm argument to the correct jdk - set the PATH to my current JDK bin folder - doublechecked registry entries for something pointing towards the system32 folder, everything is pointing at the correct locations. I'm really not sure what to do here :\ I don't remember making any changes, updating java, or modifying anything that should have caused any of these problems since the last time I had boot up eclipse.
I am writing a fairly large, multithreaded application, with many differing roles for threads (e.g. event processing, metrics, networking). Currently, if there is any inconsistency that cannot be handled, it will manifest itself as an exception. Since there's really no way to recover from some of them, I've been rethrowing it as a runtime exception of type ApplicationDeathException. Any classes that need to handle shutdown would call it from a catch block for this exception, and then rethrow it in order for it to propagate up the stack). I am considering killing off all other threads in this same manner by calling Thread#stop(Throwable) upon them. Most are fine with sudden termination, and can catch this exception should there be a need for shutdown logic. They will simply have the exception propagate up the stack, performing shutdown logic whereever needed, and eventually just killing the thread in the end. Are there any hidden dangers that I'm missing with this approach?

I am working with Java and Eclipse, which are both a bit out of my comfort zone (yup , this is an assignment...). I have 2 class files which I need to use in my project. So far I have tried: Attempt #1 I tried adding an external class folder: In my project folder I have added classes\legacy folder. In Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries I Clicked on the Add External Class Folder In the window that opened I selected the classes folder created in step 1. In my code I have added import legacy.*; Result: I can use the classes in the class files but getting the following errors: (seems to occur when the classes are attempting to use one another) The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot find the class file for IshKesher. Fix the build path then try building this project The type IshKesher cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files Note: tried for class folder as well - same results. Attempt #2 Someone suggested that using jar files should be easier, so I gave it a try: Created a jar file containing the class files: jar cvf classes.jar ContactsList.class IshKesher.class Added the jar file to the build path using this tutorial. Result: Getting an error for each usage of classes in the jar file: XYZ Cannot be resolved to a type Any Ideas how make the class files available in my code? EDIT: It turned out that Attempt #2 worked once using my source files in the default package (cannot figure out why though...).
This is a problem that I have encountered several times, and asked about previously on SO with no responses. The issue that I'm having is that sometimes when I start up Eclipse to work on my Android projects, I get tons of errors. What I realized now is that the folders Android 4.4.2 and Android Private Libraries are missing, which is clearly causing the error. I tried updating my SDK and cleaning the project, neither of which resolved the issue. I have 2 questions: What is the proper way to fix this problem? I understand that I can just copy the Android 4.4.2 folder into my project, but that is a very hacky and temporary solution. I am looking for something that will actually resolve this. How can I prevent this from happening again/why is this happening. Two possible thoughts I had were that it either happens when Eclipse force-quits, or when there are Android updates that I have to install, but I don't see why either of these would cause a problem.
i got a pop up when i started my android eclipse stating that there is a new version which has to be upgraded for 22.6.2 version but your sdk is in 22.3 version even i had error that sdk is not installed in your eclipse so i went to help-> install software added repository then restarted my eclipse. after that i added my code as usual to start coding my project but i got an exclamatory mark near my project when i compile dialog box appears as you have error in your project Exclamatory mark shown in image Next i went to show view -> problems . to check the problems i got an error stating about Android dependencies next i went to quick fix the project but dialog box appeared after fixing i got an error in jar file itself as shown below in this we can check the errors i am not able to resolve the error in the jar file can anyone help to resolve it thanks for your time and help in advance
I am doing a school project (airline reservation system). I am doing this project in java using netbeans IDE. One of my classes is the FindFlights class - it is a jPanel made directly using netbeans palette rather than hard coding of my own to create the GUI. It was working all along, when suddenly one day I tried to open the jpanel to add and edit some of my gui - It got stuck and is on a standstill (loading). The notifications bar say it is a OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space. However, the program runs as usual without any issues. But my GuI panel won't show as it is stuck when I try to open it and therefore cannot be edited. How can I solve this problem in ordr to edit the GUI? I was suggested -Xmx (e.g2g) command to be put in VM Options but it did not work. Vignesh
I am trying to install this program I found called JGraph. Softpedia says the program requires Java Runtime Environment 1.4.1. I had previously updated my version of java, then I installed this older 1.4.1 version of Java runtime environment. After that I tried to run the JGraph installer, but I got this error that said: "Can't launch executable. Could not load jmv.dll. Try re-installing Java VM or change the Java VM used by the application." I reinstalled Java Runtime 1.4.1 and got the same result. I looked and found jvm.dll in C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\j2re1.4.1\bin\client. So I'm not missing the jvm.dll file. But for some reason the installer can't find it when it runs and keeps giving me this error. I found someone was having a similar problem with MyEclipse. But I can't use that solution since this is an older program I can only locate the setup file. I am running windows 7 64-bit. How do I get this program to install if it is possible?

I am attempting to use the SMTPAppender from logback 1.1.2 in glassfish 4 to send email alerts for all logged errors, whether they are logged by glassfish itself, by its various components / modules / libraries, or by my code in a deployed ear. At different times, I tried using either JavaMail 1.5.0 or 1.5.1; 1.5.0 because glassfish 4 includes JavaMail 1.5.0 in its modules directory. and I wanted to try to be consistent; and 1.5.1 because it is the current version of JavaMail. I have configured the SMTPAppender, but when it tries to log an error from code deployed in my ear, I get a NoSuchProviderException for smtp when logback SMTPAppenderBase calls Transport.send(MimeMessage). This seems to be a ClassLoader issue, but I'm not well versed in ClassLoaders, especially with their use in glassfish, JavaMail, or logback. In the ${GLASSFISH_HOME}/glassfish/domains/domain1/config directory, I have placed: logback.xml (my logback config file) As I read online somewhere (I forget where), I placed the following files in the ${GLASSFISH_HOME}/glassfish/lib/endorsed directory: logback-core-1.1.2.jar logback-classic-1.1.2.jar jul-to-slf4j-1.7.7.jar (to redirect glassfish's built-in java.util.logging to logback) slf4j-api-1.7.7.jar (the logging api used log to logback) guava-16.0.1.jar (used by my custom logback logging code) custom-logging.jar (my custom logback logging code) javax.mail-1.5.0.jar Logback SMTPAppender configuration fails without including javax.mail-1.5.0.jar in lib/endorsed, or, alternately, mailapi-1.5.0.jar. Using javax.mail-api-1.5.0.jar instead results in numerous errors in logback configuration, so that is not an option. If I use mailapi-1.5.0.jar without smtp-1.5.0.jar instead of using javax.mail-1.5.0.jar, SMTPAppenderBase throws a NoSuchProviderException when attempting to email glassfish errors (these are not errors from my ear, but errors from outside my ear). If I use javax.mail-1.5.0.jar, SMTPAppenderBase emails glassfish errors perfectly fine. I have tried various permutations of included JavaMail & logback jars the WEB-INF/lib directory in the war in my ear, but I keep getting NoSuchProviderExceptions when attempting to email errors that where logged by code from my ear. The only other JavaMail-related jars that I've found are in the glassfish modules directory; I cannot remove them since (from what I've heard) they are an integral part of glassfish. If I run a simple test java main method outside of glassfish, with the aforementioned jars in the classpath, error emails are sent correctly, without any exceptions. Any help resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I have been developing a SpringSource 3.2 project on Java 1.5. The aim of this project is to take an excel file and output into another file of our own format after parsing the data in the excel. When running on my local developer environment (an i5, Windows 7 machine) the process runs completely fine and the result is as expected. But when I try to run it on our SIT (which is an old Windows Server 2003 SP2 x64) I get the following exception: 2014-04-24 14:18:16:574 ERROR [main] - AbstractStep | Encountered an error executing the step java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/xmlbeans/XmlOptions at org.apache.poi.POIXMLDocumentPart.<clinit>(POIXMLDocumentPart.java:43) at org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.WorkbookFactory.create(WorkbookFactory.java:62) at com.hsbc.gbm.dml.batch.item.file.ExcelFileItemReader.doOpen(ExcelFileItemReader.java:118) at org.springframework.batch.item.support.AbstractItemCountingItemStreamItemReader.open(AbstractItemCountingItemStreamItemReader.java:134) at org.springframework.batch.item.file.MultiResourceItemReader.read(MultiResourceItemReader.java:105) at org.springframework.batch.core.step.item.SimpleChunkProvider.doRead(SimpleChunkProvider.java:90) at org.springframework.batch.core.step.item.SimpleChunkProvider.read(SimpleChunkProvider.java:148) at org.springframework.batch.core.step.item.SimpleChunkProvider$1.doInIteration(SimpleChunkProvider.java:108) at org.springframework.batch.repeat.support.RepeatTemplate.getNextResult(RepeatTemplate.java:367) at org.springframework.batch.repeat.support.RepeatTemplate.executeInternal(RepeatTemplate.java:214) . . .

We are facing this issue on our clients machine. Our project uses a third party java applet to open the files in respective softwares. On windows7 we don have any issue but we have issue on windows8 OS our project is working fine in IE10 and FF browsers. of windows8 this error is thrown only in chrome. but when we execute same third party demo site which uses this same java applet to open the files in respective softwares, that is working fine in all browsers without making any changes in settings. I have read many replies from different ppl that we need to changes the client java secutiry settings. But how can we ask all our clients to make this setting so this is not a proper solution for our problem. Please see the image below ![Error message][1] is "Your security system have blocked an application with expired or not yet valid certificate from running" please help me solve this ..
I'm working on an app which needs to store many bitmap images in memory. No surprise, that OutOfMemoryError is often caught on some devices, when bitmap collection becomes too big. And I need to avoid this somehow. Saying briefly, I need a kind of collection which will behave a kind of "add items one by one, until adding next item would cause OutOfMemoryError", but I'm not experienced enough to find a proper approach. I believe, some sort of weak-reference collection should be implemented. I like WeakHashMap, but there is one crucial problem with it - I cannot control how items will be discarded. In my app, bitmaps are added in order of priority: the most important bitmaps, that should be stored as long as possible, go first. WeakHashMap, as I understand, doesn't provide such prioritization. Any working approaches or ideas? P. S. This question is not about bitmap optimization. Imagine, there are some big objects instead of bitmaps, that cannot be compressed or optimized. The question is about storing items in memory directly controlling their priority, such that objects with low priority can be GC'd quickly or not added at all. P. P. S. So far, I discovered two possible solutions: 1) dividing a collection in 2 parts, such that first, more prioritized, will contain items themselves (i. e. strong references), and second will contain soft references. Control of adding can be processed using Runtime.getRuntime.maxMemory() and .totalMemory()--when totalMemory occupied by the heap exceeds some % of maxMemory, adding new items into collection should be prohibited; 2) using a collection of soft references and track items' finalize()--when it is invoked (i. e. corresponding object is going to be picked by GC), return this item as a soft reference back to the collection and replace another item--with least priority--by phantom reference. Theoretically, this would give more strict priority control, but I'm not sure how it will behave in practice.
Basically, I have a LibGDX desktop application. I also have a server that the client connects to. The connection to the server runs on it's own personal thread with an ObjectInputStream. Here's my issue: If an item is removed from say, the Item list on the ground by a packet received, I run the risk of getting a Exception in thread "LWJGL Application" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException because it's not run on the same thread. The only option I know of is to make every packet received run on Gdx.app.postRunnable(). But I know creating all these threads could be a really bad idea. Is there a way that I could link up the packet input thread and the LWJGL thread to avoid these issues without holding up the main opengl thread? Or is postRunnable() not as dangerous as I'm thinking? Unfortunately these issue is a hard thing to google, I've attempted recuriting help from the LibGDX help IRC channel but was unable to get an answer.
I have a few things that I'm debugging in my Java program, and a few bugs that I need to work out. However, it takes a lot of setup to get to the parts I want to test. Naturally, it's getting a little frustrating to have to keep clicking through menus over and over every time I restart the program to see if my last change finally fixed the bug. I'm spending more time getting to the problem parts than I am fixing them. Is there any way to save the state of the program in memory at any particular moment so that if I encounter a bug at a certain point in execution, I can instantly end up at that point next time I load the program? Basically, I'm thinking of how save states work in emulators, but with a java program in execution, for debugging purposes. If this isn't a feature in Eclipse that I've missed, is there a plugin or program that can do this for me? If they aren't free, feel free to mention them for anyone else who comes across this answer in the future, but if at all possible I need something free.
I am using Cordova for mobile application development. I have installed Cordova using npm command and after the installation, I have created a cordova project. Whenever I try to add a platform (android) to the project it throws following error: Error : Executing command 'ant', make sure you have ant installed and added to your path I have already installed ant on my system and configured path to %ANT_HOME%\bin and other respective required platforms such as JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_PLATFORM_TOOLS and ANDROID_TOOLS. Whenever I execute the ant command in cmd, no error's are thrown. For example, after the execution of ant -version command in cmd received output is: Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.3 compiled on December 23 2013. I went through many of the questions at Stack Overflow and solved the issue of tools.jar not being present at JRE's Lib directory. still the platform add is not working. Please do help me out with this. Any help will be appreciated.
I can run a println hello world program fine in eclipse console view, with or without including a package. If I try to run from the command line, I can only run the class file that was created without a package. I change the command line dir to the location of the class file in both circumstances. If I created the class inside a package, I get a Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: I have researched this a lot, and lots of people talk about a class path. If you are going to talk about this, please be very specific. All I know about this is 1)you have to set the path when installing java in your environmental variable 2) There is a classpath file that is located in the same folder as the bin and src folder of my package.(no idea what this is) 3) if you right click on the package or class while in eclipse and select build path, the properties for Java build path come up. There are source, projects, libraries, and order & export tabs here. I have no idea what any of these do. Again, If you are going to advise with anything referring to any kind of path or class path, please be very specific for a NEWBIE. Thank you.
I have a Java program which will throw 'Too many open files' error after running for about 3 minutes. Increasing the open file limit doesn't work, because it still uses up all the limit, just slower. So there is something wrong with my program and I need to find out. Here is what I did, 10970 is the pid Check opened files of the Java process using cat /proc/10970/fd and find out most of them are pipes Use lsof -p 10970 | grep FIFO to list all pipes and find about 450 pipes Pipes look like below java 10970 service 1w FIFO 0,8 0t0 5890 pipe java 10970 service 2w FIFO 0,8 0t0 5890 pipe java 10970 service 169r FIFO 0,8 0t0 2450696 pipe java 10970 service 201r FIFO 0,8 0t0 2450708 pipe But I don't know how to continue. 0,8 in the output above means device numbers. How can I find devices with these numbers? Update The program is a TCP server and receiving socket connections from client and processing messages. I have two environments. In Production environment it works fine, but in Test environment it has this issue recently. In Production environment I don't see so many pipes. The code and infrastructure of these two environments are same, both managed by Chef.
I'm deploying a webapp in Tomcat7 which was built by Eclipse using Java Oracle 1.7. I'm receiving this error which seems to indicate that different Java versions are being used.

I continue to get out of date message when trying to view an applet. The applet checker informs me that I have the correct version. I have the security settings correct but still no joy. When trying to go through the update it stops TO inform me that I have a later version already installed, which is correct. On a Mac OS 10.9 I could show you the screen shot but don't have the points. Bugger Thanks for those who have replied and I'll try to elaborate further. JavaApplets do run from the java web site. The creation of my own applets don't run. I have done some research and it would seem that under version 8 all JApplets must be signed. This would explain the message I receive. Also the link below may explain what the problem is. Sorry but I don't have the 10 points yet to be able to send a screen shot. Again runnin the update (version7 downloads) stops to inform me that I have a later version installed (version 8). So you can see that things arn't perfect ![][1] https://weblogs.java.net/blog/cayhorstmann/archive/2014/01/16/still-using-applets-sign-them-or-else
The Problem: I am interested in being able to select the recipients of a build failure email based on the reason for failure - essentially we have test failures where each error message will have an associated team that is responsible for fixing it. As opposed to routing the email to a fixed distribution list and then manually pass on to the relevant team, I am keen to automate this (to a point!)... The Background: We have installed the Email-ext plugin and I am already using the Groovy pre-send script to alter recipients based on one type of error but we have a huge list that we'd like to do this for. One Possible Solution: My proposed solution right now is to add some code to the build process that listens to these errors, queries an error messages csv file for the relevant team, maps that against a support distribution rota file for all teams and then logs the suggested distribution list for the email. The groovy script could then simply pull the list out of the logs and set the recipients. I like this solution because we can then have external control of our error mappings and distribution lists for teams, plus the code around it can be sourced controlled... ...but is there a better way?

Please bear with me, since I am not a java Developer, and all of this is extrememly new for me. I am running Eclipse Indigo, and have a Project that I need ot build and compile .class files form the existing .java files. I have designated an output location in my directory. Within the Properties panel for the Project, for my Java Build Path, I correctly linked all the JARs and none of them are listed as missing or unbound. After attempting to Clean and Build, I am left with no results. The Error Log shows that: Failed to retrieve default libraries for ../JavaLibrary/jre/jdk1.6.0_20 And the Problem Log shows that: The Project was not built since it depends on SharedClasses, which has build path errors As I stated before, I was under the assumption that my Java Build Path was correct, but I cannot locate these errors. As for the Java Development Kit 1.6, It is linked properly in the Java Build Path, so I am at a complete loss. Can anyone direct me to how I can correct this issue that I am having?

When I created my new project, I set my minimium SDK version API to 14 (4.0 IceCreamSandwich). The Target API 19(4.4 KitKat). Compile API 19(4.4 KitKat). In starting my project this way I'm getting the error "R cannot be resolved to variable". So I went ahead and fixed the issue by regenerating my R.java and BuildConfig.java files by going to Project->clean. My R.java and BuildConfig.java is now generated. My error "R cannot be resolved to variable" is now gone. Here's my problem. When I add a new object, button, textview etc.. and try and set the contentview or findviewbyid to the object that I created in my XML file it's not finding it, I'm getting the error "splash cannot be resolved or is not a field"? In order to find the item, I have to edit my R.java file (which is something I know I shouldn't do). After I do this and run the project on the emulator I'm getting an error So here's my question, how do I get my id's to show up in the R.java file without having to manually edit it? How do I get rid of the "splash cannot be resolved or is not a field" error? without messing around with my R.java file? Thanks
I am running hadoop cluster with Ubuntu host as master-slave and virtual machine running on it as another slave(2 node cluster). It seems the solution to the problem which is supposed to be resolved at No data nodes are started is not working for me. I tried both the solutions explained there. It seems that when i manually equate the namespace ids of the affected datanodes to name node and start the cluster(solution 2 in the linked post) i still get the same error( DataStreamer Exception). Next the logs of one of the datanode shows the same Incompatible namespaceIDs error, but the namespace id of data node which is shown in the log is different from that present my tmp/dfs/data/current/version file(which is not changed and is same as that of tmp/dfs/name/current/version) After many hours of debugging i am still clueless :(. PS: There is no connection problem from my host to slave When i start the cluster using start-dfs.sh then datanodes on both the nodes are started which is normall just to clarify. This error i am facing when i copy file from local to hdfs. I performed a simple test after all this Deleted the tmp/dfs/data and tmp/dfs/name folder on master Deleted tmp/dfs/data on slave format the namenode using hadoop namenode -format started the cluster using start-dfs. all nodes it started normally on master and datanode is also up on slave now ran the copyfromLocal command and it gave me the same error as below But this time there is no namespace mismatch error in any of datanode logs master or slave 14/05/04 04:12:54 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: DataStreamer Exception: org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: java.io.IOException: File /user/dsingh/mysample could only be replicated to 0 nodes, instead of 1 at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSNamesystem.getAdditionalBlock(FSNamesystem.java:1920) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNode.addBlock(NameNode.java:783) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:606) at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RPC$Server.call(RPC.java:587) at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$Handler$1.run(Server.java:1432) at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$Handler$1.run(Server.java:1428) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at javax.security.auth.Subject.doAs(Subject.java:415) at org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.doAs(UserGroupInformation.java:1190) at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$Handler.run(Server.java:1426) at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client.call(Client.java:1113) at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RPC$Invoker.invoke(RPC.java:229) at com.sun.proxy.$Proxy1.addBlock(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:606) at org.apache.hadoop.io.retry.RetryInvocationHandler.invokeMethod(RetryInvocationHandler.java:85) at org.apache.hadoop.io.retry.RetryInvocationHandler.invoke(RetryInvocationHandler.java:62) at com.sun.proxy.$Proxy1.addBlock(Unknown Source) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSClient$DFSOutputStream.locateFollowingBlock(DFSClient.java:3720) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSClient$DFSOutputStream.nextBlockOutputStream(DFSClient.java:3580) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSClient$DFSOutputStream.access$2600(DFSClient.java:2783) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSClient$DFSOutputStream$DataStreamer.run(DFSClient.java:3023) 14/05/04 04:12:54 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: Error Recovery for null bad datanode[0] nodes == null 14/05/04 04:12:54 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: Could not get block locations.

My problem in short: I have a machine with 500 GB RAM without swap (more than enough) : top command shows 500GB of free ram I have a 20GB file containing triplets (stringOfTypeX, stringOfTypeY, double val). The meaning is that for one string of type X, the file has on average 20-30 lines, each containing this string of type X plus one (different) string of type Y and the double value associated I want to load the file in an in-memory index HashMap < StringOfTypeX, TreeMap < StringOfTypeY, val > > I wrote a Java program using BufferedReader.readLine() in this program, the hashmap is initialized in the constructor using an initCapacity of 2 times the expected number of distinct strings of type X (the expected number of keys) I ran the program using: java -jar XXX.jar -Xms500G -Xmx500G -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit the program seems to process file lines slower and slower: at first, it processes 2M lines per minute, but with each chunk of 2M lines, it gets slower and slower. After 16M of lines, it is almost stopped and, eventually, it will throw a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError(GC overhead limit exceeded) before it throws that error, top command shows me that it consumes 6% of the 500GB ram (and this value is constant, the program doesn't consume more RAM than this for the rest of its lifetime) I've read all possible internet threads regarding this. Nothing seems to work. I guess the GC starts doing a lot of stuff, but I don't understand why it does this given that I tried to allocate the hashmap enough RAM before the starting. Anyways, it seems that JVM cannot be forced to pre-allocate a big amount of RAM, no matter what command line args I give. If this is true, what is the real usage of Xmx and Xms params ? Anyone has any ideas? Many thanks !! Update: my jvm is 64-bit 6.1% of the 515 GB of RAM is ~ 32GB. Seems that JVM is not allowing the usage of more than 32 GB. Following this post I tried to disable the use of compressed pointers using the flag -XX:-UseCompressedOops . However, nothing changed. The limit is still 32GB. no swap is done at any point in time (checked using top) running with -Xms400G -Xmx400G doesn't solve the issue

We've tried using the MillerUpdatingRegression class in one of our projects and ran into an issue. After creating an instance of the class, providing the number of variables to expect and adding observations from the entire sample set, we call the "regress(int[])" method, informing the regression process which variables we'd like to include (a subset of the entire predictor set). When we do this, we receive an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception during the process because the number of variables to expect (nvars, provided when the MillerUpdatingRegression class was instantiated) is less than the number of variables passed to the "regress(int[])" method. Our understanding was that this array of integers could be a subset of the predictor indices from all observations. Does anyone know what we're missing here? ==== Updated with Code ==== double predictorData[][] = new double[n][125]; double predictions[] = new double[n]; //predictorData is a [n x 125] two-dimensional array of //features/predictors with n samples and 125 predictors //predictionsArray is a n-length array of predictions //for the sample set int numberOfPredictorVariables = 125; boolean includeConstantWhenBuildingModel = true; MillerUpdatingRegression regression = new MillerUpdatingRegression(numberOfPredictorVariables,includeConstantWhenBuildingModel); regression.addObservations(predictorData,predictionsArray) int predictorsToIncludeInRegression[] = {0,3,9,11}; regression.regress(predictorsToIncludeInRegression); //this is where the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception is generated
I've tried to upgrade Spring version from 3.1.2 to 3.2.8 on the WebSphere 8.5, but I've got the error: CWNEN0047W: Resource annotations on the fields of the org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet class will be ignored. The annotations could not be obtained because of the exception : java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext The jar spring-web-3.2.8.RELEASE.jar is present in the WAR/WEB-INF/lib directory. The archive is not damaged, the WebApplicationContext class is present there. Everything looks like before, only the spring version is higher. Everything is working with Spring 3.1.2 with the same maven build configuration and EAR descriptors! But after changing Spring version (and nothing more), the mentioned error occurs. Is there anything special that must be done when upgrading Spring version on Websphere? Or it's just a kind of incompatibility? That call comes somewhere from JmxMBeanServer. It comes in the web application initialization phase, when the EAR is deployed/updated from IBM RAD.

I am trying to extract some text from Czech pdf, but for some characters it returns gibberish, for example ů or ě or č etc... Originally I am using iText 2.1.7 and failed, so I switched to iText 5.5.0 but still fail... I tried to crack in the open source code, and this is what it shows: For example, the PdfString string that consists of a single 'ě', the getByte method returns a single-length byte[] that has integer value -85, and iText converts it to Unicode 256-85 = 171 and returns '«' Similarly, for the PdfString string that consists of a single 'ů', it gives integer value -84 and iText converts it to Unicode 172 = '¬' (Actually I don't know how is this possible, since ě and ů never go together in a character table...) This behavior is not universal, the integers from the getByte method change along the pdf. The above example comes from the beginning of page 4 of http://www.seelrc.org:8080/grammar/pdf/stand_alone_czech.pdf Is there any get around to this problem? I read many threads which concern "creating Czech PDF" and use something like font with IDENTITY_H, but I only want to extract texts.
I am using POS tagger for a project and it works successfully when it reads the tagger file from my computer (project's folder). But I need to upload the tagger file first and read the tagger file from a URL. To do so, I have uploaded the POS tagger file and I am trying to read the tagger file by giving the URL to the constructor of the MaxentTagger method: (my code is in C# and I have overridden the MaxentTagger class so it's constructor looks like this: public Tagger () { java.io.ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream(System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(@"C:\models\english-left3words-distsim.tagger")); base.readModelAndInit(null, new java.io.DataInputStream(inputStream), false); } However I get this error when I run my code: "An unhandled exception of type 'java.lang.RuntimeException' occurred in stanford-postagger.dll Additional information: java.io.FileNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path 'C:\u\nlp\data\pos_tags_are_useless\egw4-reut.512.clusters'." Does anybody know why this happens and how I can resolve this? I appreciate any sort of help very much!

I'm using H2 database as the persistence layer for unit testing an application. I'm using H2 as an in-memory database. The unit tests load a large volume of data into a single transactions table (the database is created with only this table in it). There is a thread that creates, updates and deletes rows based on some defined processing rules. The operations are sequential and work well, at full execution speed. I then added another thread that reads from the table the number of records that were inserted (it's just a select count(*) from transactions) to see where I'm at with the data load and H2 started spiting out an exception with TABLE_OR_VIEW_NOT_FOUND_1 (42102 error code). The table it cannot find is the transactions table. I'm using a JdbcConnectionPool to get two connections to the database. I know the H2 database engine is single threaded but my understanding is that it locks the entire table for concurrent operations witch means the reads will be blocked by writes and the other way around but not get a dumb error like that. Has anyone encountered this? What can be the cause?
I have been playing with a program that copies a set of files into a directory, manipulates said files, and outputs them to another directory. On 99% of the environments it has been tested / deployed on it works fine, however on one particular machine I will occasionally (roughly once every 600 files) receive FileNotFoundException: (Access denied) exceptions, which are not repeatable using the same testing conditions and inputs. After thoroughly checking all my code (and the open source lib it uses) for any unclosed resources, I ran the program alongside Process Monitor to see what other processes were accessing the files: javaw and Explorer were to be expected, but there was also a windows audio service randomly querying and locking files (wtf). Ultimately, it would make sense to retry when catching this exception, but there is no guarantee it wont still be locked. Would it make sense to deny access rights to the SYSTEM user? Is there a file-locking mechanism I should be utilizing? Has anyone else dealt with a file access issue in the past? Additional Info: I was able to run the program with no issue on my machine after removing SYSTEM privileges on the directories where files are stored, but I have never had an issue on this PC. I also implemented a retry after a wait whenever the exception is caught (again, never fired because this comp has never had the issue). Will be redeploying this week to see how it works: (are there still file access exceptions after changing privileges / allowing a small wait on failure)... Final Follow-Up: On a whim I reinstated this Stackoverflow account and found this question. If I recall, the final resolution was to: + Add any access denied files to a list + Process the list at the end of processing all other files Certainly not fool proof, but this was also running on XP, so hopefully is defunct issue now.

For a while I now have been playing around with networking between my computer and my Android phone using Java both as the server and client app. When connected, it works as it should, both ends sending and recieving as they should. However, I'm having trouble to make them always connect, even when on a LAN network, and the client usually times out when connecting, particularly when getting the ObjectInputStream. I have tried increasing and decreasing the timeouts on both the client and server sockets without any better result. Only worse. I'm not exactly certain what information anyone would need in order to give me such tips, so if I'm missing something from this text, please tell me and I'll provide what I have got. I just would like some tips as to what may be wrong with my code or program flow that cause this problem. Is there problems with the timing of the connection? In that case, why does it work when I get the ObjectOutputStream from the socket? In case it is of help, I've provided what I'd imagine is the most important parts of the connection classes on the bottom of the question post. If this is questioned in the wrong way or just being too specific to my own project, please tell me and I'll remove the question and try again. ClientConnection.java - The class handling all connection on the Android client. Server.java - Handles connecting clients and requests. Connection.java - Currently just a storage class but will later also be used to check if the server should send a connection check and make sure the client is still connected.
I'm using IntelliJ IDEA13 for a MVC project using hibernate, struts, etc, but my Intellij doesn't detect any errors when i'm writing code for example when I make and object that requires a certain import, even if I do stupid things with the code it doesn't show at red any errors. I'm compiling the files with ant and not with IntelliJ, but an IDE it's very usefull specially to imports and autocomplete and I don't know why this is happening. Any ideas? EDIT: This only happens in this MVC project (> 2.000 files), in a normal Java project everything is fine. I have 1 folder with the name "project1", inside that folder i have other 2 folders: common has all the jars that i need and impl has all the files of the project. So the way i did to put all of this in IntelliJ was to create a new project with the name "project1" so that IntelliJ got all the folders and files. Maybe it's because of that and something is wrong in the configuration. Just a quick example, if i call Query q = createQuery("select * c.name from c in class " + Category.class.getName() + " order by c.name desc"); I don't have the import for the class Query so IntelliJ should tell me to import that class and make Query red, but it doesn't and even when i click alt+enter in Query it doesn't show me the option to import that class, my IntelliJ doesn't know that are errors in the code. EDIT2: I made a new module and everything seems to be working now. I had the wrong source folder in the module.
I've searched high and low and cannot seem to find anyone with the same problem... and forgive me if I say something confusing, I'm pretty new to the Java world and never dealt with any of these technologies before. I have a simple JAX-RS Web Service that I've created in NetBeans 8.0, I'm presuming it's version 1.1 with Servlets 3.0 (but I don't know how to check for sure). I have no web.xml file, this is all configured via javax.ws.rs.core.Application which I believe was there by default when I created the project and reading around that seems to be fine with Servlets 3.0. Anyway, the ApplicationPath is just set to "api". So deploying and running this service locally in netbeans works great, I can access the service at localhost:8080/StoreFinderWebService/api/{whatever}. But now I want to host it on my DigitalOcean droplet. So I got Glassfish 4 installed on the droplet, set up the derby database and all that, then deployed the .war file as a web application. When I go to dropleturl.com:8080/StoreFinderWebService/ I can see the default index.html page show up that just says "TODO write content". But when I try to access the /api/{whatever} portion it always returns 404. I keep trying different things like writing web.xml files, changing the urls around, etc. Cannot figure it out. Here is the github repo if you want to take a look at the code: https://github.com/ianlamb/storefinder/tree/master/Web%20Service Sorry if this is a really generic question, I'm just not really sure what information is relevant for something like this.
I have a Jetty servlet that allows users to download files from my internal file storage. In this servlet I'm writing small chunks of files into outputstream that is obtained via getOutputStream() method of HttpServletResponse object. Some exceptions could be thrown when writing to this outputstream. The logic of a file transfer is quite complex, so exceptions can arise not only when connection is timeout or closed by a user. The problem is that when exception occurs, no error message is shown in the browser to the user that downloads a file. It just looks like download is finished successfully, but actually only first part of the file is downloaded. What I want is to mark such a download as failed, so a browser will tell this to the user. The first thing that comes to mind is to catch such exception and send error via sendError method of HttpServletResponse object, or send redirect to error page. Unfortunatly, it does not work, because sendError method can be called only before the response is commited, otherwise IllegalStateException is thrown. And response is already commited after first chunk flushing of response outputstream. So, my question is how to tell a browser that downloading of a file is failed when an exception occurs during writing to a HttpServletResponse outputstream after the response is commited?
So one of the tech debt issues that my team faces is that while tests are running, I will occasionally see exceptions being logged as part of the output of running the tests. The problem is that sometimes these exceptions are supposed to happen (for example when I am testing failure scenarios) but it makes it hard to tell when watching the logs whether something unexpected happened and I could be missing an issue that I haven't tested. When I talk about exceptions being logged, I'm referring to the fact that libraries I use may log exceptions as well as throw them, so even though I catch the exception in my test, I still get the log output which clutters up my log. I was wondering if anyone had come up with a way to filter the log output so that I would only see error output that isn't expected as part of the test. I understand this is a pretty difficult thing to do, but perhaps someone has come up with a method for doing this.
It's hard to explain, but I'll try my best. There's a .jar file that opens up a GUI for a tournament environment. It's independent and I'm not given the source code. I need to code an agent in Java that competes in the tournament. When the .jar file opens, I can specify the path to my agent's class files in the GUI. This works fine. But I'm not sure how to debug this because the .jar file doesn't open in eclipse. I tried using external tools, which seems to run the .jar file but the GUI doesn't open up, so I can't specify the path to the agent. The tournament environment documentation doesn't really provide instructions to operate it without the GUI, so I really need to use just the GUI. Any way I can run this file through eclipse, so I can see how my own agent works with the environment and test/debug accordingly? Additional info - this .jar also acts as a library which I was able to import into Eclipse without any issues.
I am writing an android application using eclipse and am trying to use jar files I generated from another eclipse (not android) project I wrote. However, when I try to run my android application, I get the following error message: [2014-05-15 18:42:25 - ResearchNotebook] Dx 1 error; aborting [2014-05-15 18:42:25 - ResearchNotebook] Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1 which is preceeded by a longer error message. I looked at the following question (Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*) when not building a core library), and but am not sure how I would reconfigure the eclipse IDE so that rt.jar and android.jar are not being passed to dx. However, I wrote non android java code within the same project using the jar and ran it in the console. It worked perfectly fine. The problem only arises when I try to use the jar for the classes pertaining to the android application. At this point, I have tried many different alternatives, including cleaning the project, deleting the jars from the buildpath and adding them again, and changing order and export according to the following site: http://tools.android.com/recent/dealingwithdependenciesinandroidprojects. Is there something else I should have done when generating the jar from my eclipse (non android) project? I have really hit a wall this problem and am at a loss about how to proceed.
I'm fairly new to Eclipse and I'm using Kepler with EGit right now but I ran into a problem every time I compile my Java application. I've searched this forum to find a solution for my problem but I am still very confused as to what I can do to fix it. The application worked flawlessly yesterday morning and it works fine on my project partner's laptop but after syncing the project with 4 new commits from my project partner today, I keep getting a Source not found error every time I try to run the application. I get a button saying Edit Source Lookup Path and when I click on it and expand the folders, I get something that looks like this: There are a bunch of .jar files above what you see and maTKProject is the name of my project. If anyone could give some insight on how to fix this problem, I would greatly appreciate it!
I am pretty new to Elastic Search. I have following things in my code OR looking for solution to 'No Node Available Exception' problem in the following scenario. 1) We have ES running on System with 1 Node and 1 Cluster. 2) We have 4 indexes on ES. (Each index has different type of data, Example: Customer Preference / Customer Address / Customer Interests / Customer Basic Details) 3) We have WebApplication (as webservice) running on Tomcat. 4) We are calling webservice method as Controller's. -This will receive request from consumers in the form JSON data. 5) Based on that data(Example: If consumers asks for Customer Preference for given customer Id then we go to 'Customer Preferences' index) we will go to service(using Spring) layers. 6) In each of the service layer we get TransportClient instance in SingleTon object and wait for its response and return the result to Controller. In a Scenario if consumer asks for all 4 types of data for a Customer, and if we ask first for preference, address, interests and basic details in sequence. It works well. But this adds to performance. So we want these things to process and get data parallel. So we used Spring Task Executors to do this parallel. In that case we get data from one index and others will get 'No Node Available Exception'. Its pretty random to on say on which data we get this problem. Pleas help me here. Thanks in advance!....
I'm developing an RPC Web Service that offers methods to clients and I want to use Exceptions to handle errors within the server application, as to automatically generate a response with an error header and, more important, a custom error code (integer). I have created a base CustomException class which holds an integer and the message. Should I create a new class for every exception on every method, with its custom error code hard-coded on the class? Or is there another approach to this problem? e.g. let's suppose I have a Login method which can have two exceptions, "UnknownUsername" and "InvalidPassword" (just as an example; as Tieston T. commented, it's not a good practice to return information on authentication). The approaches I can think of so far are: Using a LoginException class and setting the error code on the internal method Creating a UnknownUsernameException and an InvalidPasswordException class, inheriting LoginException, and hard-code the error code on each class
I have a Java socket client talking to a socket server written in another language. I am running this on Linux. Java client is coded with test logic - establish client connection from java to the other language, send dummy string to server, get dummy string back - close client socket - loop. After millions of calcs and around 7 hours, I got a read timeout on java side. Don't have any monitoring tools right now to see if GC came in the way or something else. Whats the general expectation here? should it run forever until server space runs out or some other external factor interferes? How do I make this communication reliable? any best practices for fault-tolerance to be coded here? Adding replies here to comments below: Thanks everyone for responding. Yes, exceptions are being catched and logged- that's how i came to know about the socket read timeout error. and yes, connection was established, send also happened and then the read timeout occurred (as per read timeout error).. so that's puzzling - if the server was having problems, the connection would not be successful or something else would go wrong before sending/reading data. Also, there was no error on the server - the server has a 10s write timeout, but even then there was no error - not sure why. java has 2 min read timeout - and still threw the error. I had only put in error logging and not debug/info level. no errors were there on the server application, only java client threw error and then it kept on throwing a read timeout for 1 hr. So, that's again weird - java kept on connecting and sending test string and had problems receiving the data? and server never complained? i can code fault tolerance to say if read timeout then wait some time and then try again - but not sure if this would completely solve my problem. sadly the server can't be rewritten to keep the socket open.
I am currently implementing a single signon solution for a customer that is based on Java, Tomcat and Kerberos. Users are to access the URL of an intranet Tomcat application from their client browsers, the Tomcat application acquires the users' credentials via Kerberos and redirects them to the actual web application. Our customer's environment is a typical mixture of a Windows AD server acting as the KDC and Linux Tomcat application servers. The SSO functionality is supposed to be used from both Windows and Linux clients. This is what appears to be different from most answers I can find on the net where people have Linux web application servers but only use Windows clients. Now, in my local setup I get some strange behaviour. My development environment is a Tomcat 7.0.26 running from MyEclipse 8.6 under Windows 7. My test environment is a Tomcat 7.0.26 or 7.0.53 behind an Apache web server on a Centos 6 machine. I have set up the AD server correctly, generated the necessary keytab files etc. and everything is running smoothly in the development environment. I can access the Tomcat application from both Linux and Windows clients using IE and Firefox, Kerberos authentication proceeds and I get redirected properly. When deploying the Tomcat application on the test server this keeps working when trying to sign on from Windows clients. However, when I try to access the test server from a Linux client (I have tried from Linux Mint 13 and Ubuntu 13.10), I get the following error: javax.servlet.ServletException: GSSException: No credential found for: 1.3.6.1.5.2.51.3.6.1.5.2.5 usage: Accept net.sourceforge.spnego.SpnegoHttpFilter.doFilter(SpnegoHttpFilter.java:233) I have to admit that I do not properly understand this message. Does it point to a problem with the credentials supplied by the client or a problem with the application server negotiating with the KDC? I have done some research on this problem and have found out that the indicated oid 1.3.6.1.5.2.5 stands for GSS_IAKERB_MECHANISM and not GSS_KRB5_MECHANISM or GSS_SPNEGO_MECHANISM which I find strange. Also, nobody else appears to have exactly the same problem. I have tried switching from MIT Kerberos to Heimdal Kerberos and back. I have tried Firefox and Chromium, on the application server I have switched between Tomcat 7.0.26 and 7.0.53, the problem still persists. I am using the latest spnego.jar. Now: Calls from Linux to the Tomcat running on the Windows development machine succeed and calls from Linux clients to the Linux application server fail with the same error message for both browsers tried. Any ideas on this one?

I am a bit of an idiot to how SSL and Webservices work at the fine-grained level. I am developing a system that calls several web services, some with secured URLs and others that are not with little problem. Currently, however, I am doing an integration with Endicia's LabelServer Web API. The webservice is used to calculate and print postage. The test URL and WSDL is at: https://www.envmgr.com/LabelService/EwsLabelService.asmx I used wsimport to create and setup a Java client for connecting to this webservice but when I try to all it I get the error PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Path does not chain with any of the trust anchors This error is documented here: Java7 Refusing to trust certificate in trust store in which it's discussed how Java 7 forces an error with self-signed certificates with "bad" keyusage. Bad in this situation is defined as not containing keyCertSign. The webservice does work with Java 6. I can believe this situation might apply to this certificate since it's only being used as a test server, but I don't know how to verify that. There's a bug report on it that is solved (http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7018897), but I'm not sure how any of this translates to fixing the problem for a Windows Tomcat environment. I exported the certificate onto my machine, but am uncertain of how to proceed from there. EDIT: I tried using OpenSSL to modify the certificate and add it to my keystore as described in the "Refusing to trust certificate in trust store" link and it didn't work. It seems like this is a process that is done by the owner of the certificate, right? I wonder if there's some way I can configure my Java 7 environment to let this certificate through.
Following this example http://viralpatel.net/blogs/spring-3-mvc-handling-forms/ I'm facing an error I can't solve.

I have setup my request to the Yelp v2 search api using the location parameter passing in a full address to work using the scribe-java OAuth encoding code as given in the Java sample on their github repository. I am testing a local address in the US to search but have been getting a 400 (UNAVAILABLE_FOR_LOCATION) through my application running on localhost. The strange part is that the request works if I take the URL that my application generates (after OAuth signature) and paste it into the browser, the request succeeds and I see the data I need. I have tried adding a user agent header to my request (which was my best guess as to why this behaviour would happen), but to no avail. Has anyone ran across this error or have an idea as to how to solve this issue? The Yelp support Google group has been useless.

I would like to see what Java classes and functions are used by an existing application called Nuix. I would like to attach NetBeans or maybe Eclipse as a debugger. I am using Windows 7 64-bit. The application starts with a Windows executable and loads classes from JARs as needed. Therefore, I am unable to launch the application with command line switches -Xdebug and -Xnoagent. The application is packaged with JRE 7 in one of its subdirectories: \Nuix5\jre\. Since there are a number of .properties files in Nuix 5\jre\lib, my hope is that it is possible to configure one of those to load everything in debug mode. How is the question. If that is not possible, is there another way to debug mode? As a side question, how is it possible for a Windows .exe to use JARs? I have not seen this architecture before, and I do not believe IKVM.NET is used, and J# is not used because the application is unmanaged, according to Process Explorer.
1. I create my app header on Google Play. I create an application with google's LVL library. I sign into an Android device with the same account that I use to sign into my Google Play Developer Console. The LicenseChecker was using the correct public key (from google play app license key). Clearing my Google Play cache. Not uploaded the application, but the license server need response my set on license test setting page, nop? when i running the app, the license server always response 3(ERROR_NOT_MARKET_MANAGED). I waiting 24 hours, but nothing happens, response is 3. I upload the app(same versioncode) to the google play, but not published. I waiting 24 hours again , but nothing happens, response is 3. WTF :) Okay, just back to start, and step by step: I create an app from android sdk licensing sample. The LVL version is 2. I make a header on google play. A BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY rewrite in sample from a google play app license. I sign in an android device with my publishers account (after factory reset) This sample is returned 3! What's wrong with me????

I followed the following instructions to build the google play services sample app "type a number": " 1. Start Eclipse Import the Google Play Services library project (available for download through the SDK manager): Click File | Import | Android | Existing Android Code into Workspace Select SDK/extras/google/google_play_services/google_play_services_lib (where SDK stands for the path where you installed your Android SDK) Click Finish Import eclipse_compat/libraries/BaseGameUtils as a library Click File | Import | Android | Existing Android Code into Workspace Select the eclipse_compat/libraries/BaseGameUtils project Click Finish Right-click on BaseGameUtils, then click Properties In the project properties window, click the Android section Check the Is Library checkbox Add a reference to the google_play_services_lib project (click Remove to remove any broken references, then click Add to add the correct one) Import the desired sample from the eclipse_compat directory (Project | Import | Android | Existing Android Source) Go into the project properties window for that project (right-click, Properties) and check that this project has a reference to the BaseGameUtils project. Your project should now compile. However, don't run it yet, since you still need to adjust your game's IDs in order for the sample(s) to work. " However, in eclipse the file "GameHelper.java" is flagged and contains the following error: "GoogleApiClient.ApiOptions cannot be resolved to a type" Does anyone know where the error lay?
I am writing a database backed web server and I was wondering about the best practise/idiomatic way to implement the following: So when a user creates account the server needs to insure that the username has not been already taken. The username field in the database is defined as a unique key. So rather than doing a two step process of checking the existence of the username and then adding it, I was hoping I could take advantage of the DBMS. By this I mean, just add the record and trust that an SQLException will be thrown. My issue is how to find the cause of the exception. As in I certainly cannot return exception.getMessage() to the user but I need a way of identifying if it was due to a duplication in an unique key field that caused the error (and therefore let the user know) and not another type of issue that JDBC may throw (other issues should instead be logged). I could try to parse e.getMessage() but I was hoping there would be a more full proof way to do this.
I need help or guidance when running two java programs and trying to read an exit error. This'll be a little hard to explain so please forgive me if I'm not really clear. Let's say that the chain of executing is something like this: bat1.bat is the start, it execute myPGM.jar myPGM.jar calls a 2nd bat: bat2.bat bat2.bat calls an external bat, let's call it: runProcess.bat runProcess.bat calls an external .jar and when it finish, it does echo errorlevel=%errorlevel%. The problem is that the second .jar is failing and: If I run all the chain: bat1.bat -> myPGM.jar -> bat2.bat -> runProcess.bat -> external.jar -> echo... Although the external jar is failing, it always prints 0! If I pause the execution before the runProcess.bat call, open a new cmd window and call it from there.. it prints the error correctly! I'm really stuck with this, and probably don't have the knowledge to see where the problem is :( My guess is that the problem can be related to the two java programs running at the same time?.. maybe the second one is like in another instance of a jvm, and that's why the bat always print errorlevel=0? Or maybe is how I'm calling the .bat? I'm missing a parameter or something like this? Well, reallyy really thanks!
We have a JAVA web application and recently we migrated to a new software. Earlier we used WebSphere 7 as a application server but after migration we moved to Tomcat 7. In regression testing we found a issue with PDF download on one of the web pages. The page has 4 PDF file download link all of them pointing to same struts action class. But only two of them works in IE 10 (v-10.0.9200.16897) and other two fails with the "Http 400 - Bad Request" error. We tested the same page on Chrome browser and all pdf download link work fine. The strange thing is if I copy the non-working download link and open it another tab then the download works just fine. But try to open it in current page and it fails. Has anyone experienced this behavior? Or if you can help me to identify the issue it will be a great help. Thanks, Hanumant
I have two webservices. One webservice calls another webservice. These web services are hosted on two different instances of AWS. If webservice which is called is idle for some time, I am getting this exception - com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: The last packet successfully received from the server was 49,381,933 milliseconds ago. The last packet sent successfully to the server was 49,381,933 milliseconds ago. is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem. If I restart the AWS instance, I don't get this exception. Tomcat is the server used, and Mysql as an database, webservices developed using spring-mvc. I searched on internet, but found 'autoReconnect=true' is not recommended. and not sure how much I can increase 'wait_timeout', as I am not sure how much time instance will be idle. Please suggest what can be done.
I'm also trying to get help on Eclipse's forums, here, but I'll briefly explain the problem here. I started getting errors on the second page of the push dialog (after entering or selecting the remote URI) all of a sudden, I don't know of any changed settings that would be likely to have caused it (see below). At first glance it seems like an SSH passphrase problem, see screenshot here, but having checked, regenerated (both locally and on Github, the remote server) the keys, and even switching to HTTPS instead of SSH, I'm still getting similar errors. Now, since I've tried numerous things to fix it, the reproducibility of the individual errors is not high and I may not be able to remember the messages for all of them. It is usually an "Auth fail" or "Transport error" dialog with a short but unrevealing message, similar to the above screenshot. When I tried HTTPS, I was able to get past the second screen of the push dialog, but it ultimately failed with "cannot open git-receive-pack." The common factor here is that the stuff does not make it to the remote repo and that's unacceptable! This is done with Windows 7, and I'm regrettably not very familiar with any command-line based solution for Linux, which I may have found on another thread on this site. Also, like I said, this seemed to occur without a triggering setting on my part. I did perform an update in Eclipse so that I could compile Java 8-only code around the same time, but would that really cause a problem with EGit? Anyways, thank you for helping me with this and have a great day!
Im having the Error:java: Fatal Error: Unable to find package java.lang in classpath or bootclasspath on my IntelliJ when i try to build/compile ANY project. Something that should be stated here is that NETBEANS, Eclipse and even the javac command line can compile build and execute the same project without errors, this is why i am saying that the problem is with INTELLIJ, all other IDE works well. In IntelliJ i already: Restarted Reinstalled Invalidate Caches / Restarted Deleted/Readded the JDK in Project JDK Deleted/Readded the JDK in Platform Settings Rebuild / Recompile In Windows i already: Deleted / Reinstalled java SDK Deleted / Readded the JAVA_HOME, PATH and CLASSPATH on System Variables Tryed the above on User Variables Deleted and Reinstalled IntelliJ IDEA In Internet already seached for issues like this i MANY sources, here on StackOverflow i found: Question #1 | Question #2 | Question #3 | Question #4 | Question #5 And 30+ sites, and tried every answer... Here you can see my IntelliJ Project Structure on last time that i tried to build/compile I was using Java 1.8 when i get this error, after some hours i installed Java 1.7 and the project worked fine... maybe IntelliJ dont support Java 1.8? Anyway, if anyone knows one way to make the Java 1.8 work on IntelliJ the question still open.
I am reading Android Native Development Kit Cookbook. And there are sample codes in each chapter. Current chapter is dedicated to Debugging an Android NDK application with NDK GDB. But I have problems with it. The cookbook requires that AndroidManifest.xml has the android:debuggable attribute of the <application>element set to true. But when I set it true or false Eclipse complains with an error. I have read that android:debuggable=true is not mandatory, you can just do ndk-build NDK_DEBUG=1 and app will be debuggable. So I have omitted setting debuggable flag in Manifest and just build the app. Then deployed the app on device run it and called ndk-gdb from terminal. But I got this message: $ ndk-gdb ERROR: Package cookbook.chapter3 is not debuggable ! You can fix that in two ways: Rebuilt with the NDK_DEBUG=1 option when calling 'ndk-build'. Modify your manifest to set android:debuggable attribute to "true", then rebuild normally. How to overcome this problems (the flag in manifest and achieve debugging)? Please help me to debug my test project. I am just learning.
"Debugception!" You may notice that within the first 15 seconds of this YouTube video (from 1:01:01 to 1:01:16), Markus Persson (aka "Notch", creator of Minecraft) has somehow managed to save/update an application and attach a debugger to it while it was already under the process of being debugged, supposedly all with a simple keyboard shortcut. The previously coded application somehow magically became the newly edited one, and seemingly without relaunching it or spawning a new process... It's possible that this is just some form of locally remote debugging, but something about it just doesn't seem quite right. I've spent several days Googling and asking around on how he was able to do this, yet to no avail. I've found no such option under Eclipse preferences, and whenever I try to save & debug an already running application, it simply launches a separate instance of the newly updated application, side-by-side with the older, outdated one. Am I missing something? How was this possible? How was he able to utilize such an astounding, powerful debugging feature? Thanks in advance! Update Okay, so this appears to be a standard feature specific to Eclipse. Coming from a background in NetBeans and Visual Studio, I'm astounded that this doesn't seem to exist elsewhere (or at least in NetBeans!)...

I have created on activity and inside that i have created 9 fragment file which swipes from left to right. All the 9 fragments will interact with mysql database and populate the data. But i found some bug in all the fragments that when i swipe from left to right it will populate correctly but again when i swipe from right to left the population starts duplicating the data. Consider it is populating the listview and there are 4 data populating means 4 list view in one fragment when i go right side and come to left hand side again the same 4 data populating will duplicate and there will be 8 data's found I am using android-java code and there is mysql interaction is being done in all the fragments seperately can anyone help how to restrict the fragments such that when i swipe or come back left side from right hand side it must not duplicate
I'm developer and game developers use my library in their apps only a single developer reported a runtime Abstract method error crash issue on Android device and when i looked into the proguard mapping on where its happenig it's pointing to Line 68 in this class org.bson.util.AbstractCopyOnWriteMap. Crash Report: Fatal Exception: java.lang.AbstractMethodError abstract method "java.util.Map com.mypackage.sdk.impl.bf.a(java.util.Map)" com.mypackage.sdk.impl.bf. (SourceFile:68) Proguard Mapping : org.bson.util.AbstractCopyOnWriteMap -> com.mypackage.sdk.impl.bf: java.util.Map delegate -> a The weird part is, it doesn't happen everytime it randomly happens and i noticed it only on Android 4.4.2 platform and only that developer reported it. Does anybody have an idea on why its crashing ? It's different from the normal Abstract Method error crash, mostly its a compile time issue, but it can happen @ runtime if the jars not getting packaged properly, but thats not seems to be the issue here. It will be helpful if someone can provide an insight on how to debug this one.
I'm using Apache Commons Pool for storing a set of Couchbase Clients. When doing load tests (but still with a small load), after a couple thousand operations (using a 100 connections pool) some Couchbase Client Objects start throwing IlegalStateException and then they shutdown. I would like to know if there is a way to check if a CouchbaseClient object is still valid for being used. The Exception is generated when a "set" operation is called from the object, so checking if the client is valid would be an acceptable solution. I'm still not sure what is the origin of the Exception. However, when I do a sort of validation of the client before returning to the pool, the problem stops happening. The issue is that this validation (calling a set operation to test if the client is working) is too brute force and impacts performance. I would like to find a smoother way of checking this.
I am using JBoss AS 7.1 with AspectJ 1.8.0. The application is EAR file and within, all the jar files are under ear/lib folder and there is no jar file within war/lib/. It is a maven 3 based project where I apply aspectj during build time weaving. Aspectjrt has been included as part of dependency. Problem comes whenever I apply more aspectj advices, where within the woven .jar file has about 30 .ajc$/advices for one class based on the pointcuts defined during build time weaving. When it's the case, Jboss Classloader always fails by throwing NoClassDefFoundError. Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.my.MyClass from [Module "deployment.myear.ear:main" from Service Module Loader] at org.jboss.modules.ModuleClassLoader.findClass(ModuleClassLoader.java:190) ... .... .. However if I apply less advices to one particular class, there is no issue at all. I also verify the problematic jar via command line with the woven jar files without issue. It seems to happen only when running within JBoss. Is this a known issue/bug with JBoss AS 7.1 or is there configuration required for my use case ? Any help on this is appreciated. Thanks & Regards, Rapoo
Windows 8.1 Java ME SDK 8 Netbeans 8 Since downloading Netbeans a few days ago I've been having persistent problems. It's very slow and the the emulator starts up less than half the time. MosT of the time I get An error once the emulator opens and it's about the begin running the program. It says: Error Installing IMlet: See Device Log for Details.

I know there are a lot of threads to this topic, but after searching for ~10 hours without a solution I will ask in a new thread. I got two projects not working (properly). I use Windows 8.1 64 bit with a clean jre/jdk 8 and javaee7. I have a glassfish 4 server and netbeans 8. When I say my server log is empty than I mean the server domain log file found in "%glassgish4%\glassfish\domains\domain1\log". My projects are simple enterprise-applications with JavaBeans. My first problem is a multiexception in a simple remote method invocation via session-beans. I created the enterprise-application-project and a normal client (java) project to hold the remote interface. The client calls a simple method to add two numbers. The project-structure can be seen here: Project-Structure The interface in the client-application can bee seen here: NeueSessionBeanRemote The interface implementation in the enterprise-application is this one: Interface-Implementation And here is the main-method from client-application: main-method The netbeans error output is here: netbeans errror output The server log is empty (just a succes notification from deploying the enterprise application project). Well this was the first problem. Now I will tell you about the second. It is a project allowing to enter customer information in a jsp form and inserting them into a database (travel agency). This is the structure: second project structure I copied the class "Kunde" to the client-application because the RemoteInterface did not know "Kunde". Well this is my RemoteInterface "Reisebuero2Remote": Reisebuero2Interface I won't show the client main method, because it is empty ;) The interface-implementation looks like this: interface-implementation The "Kunde" looks like that: Kunde Because the web implementation is simple html I will only show you the jsp file: jsp file And here is my probelm I can't even build the enterprise-application: error at building My server log is empty again. If you need further information I will try to provide them. Thank you very much for your support.

I have a jsf 1.2 application with some links in the index page. This links are oppened by clicks, on new jquery dialogs. Every link open a new page of my app in a distinct dialog, so, the application can open many links in many dialogs in a single page. All my managed beans have session scope. My problem is, when i open a new dialog and click in any link inside, my application still works fine, but after this, if i click in other link in my index page to open another dialog, the app shows me a ViewExpiredException. I have tried update my jsf to 2.0, set EnableRestoreView11Compatibility in web.xml to true, use keepAlive in my beans, but nothing works. I think its happened because i have a main page with one state and, when i click to open a new page in a jquery dialog, it loads the entire page and put the html inside. So, the request made no reference to the state of main page. How can i resolve this?

Is there a way to run an Android JUnit test when there's an error in another file in the project (a different test that's still under development)? Specifically, I'm trying to run test A by right clicking it in Eclipse and selecting Run As -> Android JUnit Test. There's an error in test B, so when I try to run A, I get the following message: Android Launch Your project contains error(s), please fix them before running your application. B is still under development and isn't being tested at the moment, so I want to ignore the errors in it if possible. The only way I could come up with was commenting out the body of test B, but this is a pain. Sorry if this has been answered before. I searched for it, but the only answers I could find were for questions in which the person didn't know where the errors were. I'm using Eclipse Juno Service Release 2, Android API 19 (4.4.2), and JUnit 3.
I have a legacy java app written up by a previous developer. A bug has recently been found in it, and I've been given the task of fixing it. Part of the problem is that there were never any error messages reporting from it. By putting in a lot of logging messages, I finally narrowed it down to a specific line in the code - it's trying to run a method on a null object. This is something that SHOULD have thrown an error into the log. Yet it hasn't. And even fixing this one, there's a lot of this problem in the code - assuming something will have a value when it doesn't. Every time I put in a data-verification for one, it fails somewhere shortly down the line for a very similar reason, and then I have to go through the hassle of putting in logging commands every other line again to finally narrow it down. Why would a java program be silently failing instead of throwing errors? I can't seem to find any sort of setting suggesting that this is on purpose, but I'm really not even sure where to look for such a thing.
I wanted to develop an android app a few months ago, so I followed all the steps from here-> https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html?hl=p and I believe I downloaded all the tools I needed. I never got around to developing anything, so I tried starting again a few days ago. When I went to the above mentioned website, it said download the new versions of this and that, so I did. I tried following the steps, but now when I try to open eclipse, I get an error saying: "Error could not find Java SE Runtime Environment". My questions are: How do I delete everything and start from scratch? I wan't to delete eclipse, sdk manager, sdk folder, everything. I want to follow the download instructions all over again and see what happens because it did seem to work the first time i tried a few months back. Do I just delete some programs from control panel? If this is not easy, how can I fix the error I'm getting when trying to open eclipse? Edit: windows 7, 64-bit OS, if that helps
This seems to be a popular topic regarding hibernate, both on stackoverflow (IllegalStateException with Hibernate 4 and ManyToOne cascading) and outside (https://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1031016&view=previous) but it is still unclear to me. I have object A, I merge it with entity manager E1. I close E1. I have object B, it references the instance of A we merged with E1. B has cascaded merge & persist on A. I merge B with entitymanager E2 and i get the exception "Error occurred while storing entity [...]. An entity copy [...] was already assigned to a different entity [...]." All my searching seems to indicate they introduced some additional check somewhere in hibernate version 4.1.3 or there-abouts. In fact, if I run the exact same code with 4.1.2, it works. The additional check supposedly entails a proper equals() and hashCode() implementation, but my objects have those and I have added debug logging to them: they are never called. I can "solve" it by removing the cascade feature but...well...it's handy... How do I solve this issue so cascading can work as it is supposed to? UPDATE Apparently the issue currently is that B actually references A twice. So I assume the second detached A is throwing the exception. I can see how this could be that B is merged, the first instance of A is attached and the second throws an exception. However is there no way to force hibernate to simply use the reattached first version of A for the second A? It will be very hard to guarantee that A is reattached only once in my context.
I was trying to do the first steps in Java EE with this tutorial Java EE/Glassfish Tutorial I'm using the latest glassfish-, eclipse- and java-version on a windows 7 32-Bit PC with two monitors. But I get the following error when running the servlet on the server. The first few lines of error log: message: Unhandled event loop exception java.lang.StackOverflowError at org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32.COM.VtblCall(Native Method) at org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32.IDispatch.Invoke(IDispatch.java:64) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleAutomation.invoke(OleAutomation.java:571) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleAutomation.invoke(OleAutomation.java:534) at org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE.navigate(IE.java:1285) at org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE.setUrl(IE.java:1464) at org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE$7.handleEvent(IE.java:542) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleEventTable.sendEvent(OleEventTable.java:55) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleEventSink.notifyListener(OleEventSink.java:152) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleEventSink.Invoke(OleEventSink.java:120) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleEventSink.access$1(OleEventSink.java:97) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleEventSink$1.method6(OleEventSink.java:71) at org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32.COMObject.callback6(COMObject.java:119) ... the first few lines repeats for ~50 times until it ends with: at org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32.COM.VtblCall(Native Method) at org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32.IDispatch.Invoke(IDispatch.java:64) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleAutomation.invoke(OleAutomation.java:571) at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleAutomation.invoke(OleAutomation.java:534) at org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE.navigate(IE.java:1285) at org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE.setUrl(IE.java:1464) at org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.setUrl(Browser.java:1125) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.browser.BrowserViewer.navigate(BrowserViewer.java:625) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.browser.BrowserViewer.setURL(BrowserViewer.java:666) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.browser.BrowserViewer.setURL(BrowserViewer.java:287) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.browser.BrowserViewer$10.handleEvent(BrowserViewer.java:736) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.EventTable.sendEvent(EventTable.java:84) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.sendEvent(Widget.java:1057) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.runDeferredEvents(Display.java:4170) at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.readAndDispatch(Display.java:3759) at org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.swt.PartRenderingEngine$9.run(PartRenderingEngine.java:1113) at org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable.Realm.runWithDefault(Realm.java:332) at org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.swt.PartRenderingEngine.run(PartRenderingEngine.java:997) at org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.E4Workbench.createAndRunUI(E4Workbench.java:138) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench$5.run(Workbench.java:610) at org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable.Realm.runWithDefault(Realm.java:332) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench(Workbench.java:567) at org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench(PlatformUI.java:150) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.application.IDEApplication.start(IDEApplication.java:124) at org.eclipse.equinox.internal.app.EclipseAppHandle.run(EclipseAppHandle.java:196) at org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseAppLauncher.runApplication(EclipseAppLauncher.java:110) at org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseAppLauncher.start(EclipseAppLauncher.java:79) at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:354) at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:181) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source) at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.invokeFramework(Main.java:636) at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:591) at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:1450) Session data: eclipse.buildId=4.3.0.M20130911-1000 java.version=1.7.0_45 java.vendor=Oracle Corporation BootLoader constants: OS=win32, ARCH=x86, WS=win32, NL=de_DE Framework arguments: -product org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product Command-line arguments: -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86 -product org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product Hopefully some of you has a guess what the problem might be. I already tried a completely new installation of java, eclipse, glassfish, etc. Even a downgrade on eclipse 3.7. Other entries here supposed that the two monitors might be the reason, but I also tried to switch one monitor off.
We are getting the following exception when a Java EE server tries to resolve a host name from one of the services. We were able to resolve that host name on the box manually with ping/nslookup command. We were also able to fire that external service using curl with same parameters what server is trying to use. So it seems like this issue happens only when we try to make a request to a external host from a Java/Java EE application. To resolve this issue, we manually added an entry in /etc/hosts file and it solved the problem but we want a permanent solution so we don't have to keep changing the IP. It was working before without adding that entry but all of a sudden it stopped working.

I am getting the exception in the title when I try to use Jenkins to deploy a WAR file to a WebLogic (12) server. When I deploy the same WAR file to my localhost WebLogic (10.3.6) everything works ok. I'm developing in NetBeans 7.4, which has Hibernate 3.6.10, and my local WebLogic has been updated to work with JPA 2.0. I've tried everything I've seen on the Web but I can't resolve this error. My persistence.xml defines the persistence provider (Hibernate) and that's all. My weblogic.xml has the tags to use application JARS antlr.*, org.hibernate.*, and javax.persistence.* (I'm writing this from memory so bear with me a little). If I remove javax.persistence.* I get a java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: INSTANCE exception. Everything I've read points to two different versions of persistence and that is causing the problems. I figured if I told weblogic to use everything that was copied into the WAR file (/lib) that it would use that. I can't give any information about the Web server because all I know is that it's using WebLogic 12. Oh, one other thing, I'm not using Spring (which is what a lot of posts I read dealt with). I'm using Hibernate for persistence with an Oracle DB and the Web server is WebLogic 12. Any thoughts or ideas? Thanks.
I always have some of the most obscure problems, and often I'll find similar problems but ones not applicable to my actual problem... Anyways, I'm having an issue with M2Eclipse showing an error in Eclipse. Currently, my POM.xml references xml-apis:xml-apis of some version (yes, I'm aware of the issue with Xerces), and apparently, xml-apis replaces and not overrides classes in the JDK. One specific example of such is org.w3c.dom.Element in rt.jar in the JDK; this class exists, but xml-apis has a class with the same name and package structure, effectively replacing it -- or so Eclipse thinks. What makes this bad for me is that since xml-apis replaces this implementation instead of overriding it, there are references in the code (which I've been tasked with migrating from Ant to Maven, where you could just change the build order and Eclipse would stop having a whinge) where the libraries to not match up... For example, Element e; e.getTextContext(); would yield an error such that "The method getTextContent() is undefined for the type Element." This error only shows in the editor and the Problems window in Eclipse, though. But Maven compiles it just fine... So why is Eclipse showing an error? To the best of my knowledge, there's no way to change the build order in a Maven project in Eclipse to make it stop doing this. Does anyone have any solutions for this? For reference (if it matters, which I doubt) I'm running Windows 7 Professional, compiling with JDK 1.6, and I'm using Maven 3.0.4.
Is there a way to get the Java compiler to produce an error when a "long" is implicitly converted to a "double", as this can cause data loss? EDIT: The reason I cannot accept the answer from Alex, is that it defeats my purpose. What I want to do is create a minimal "functor" API, that does not cause garbage by directly supporting primitive types too, instead of only supporting object types using generics. But to keep the number of interfaces small, I want to use as few types as possible. With just double and Object, for parameters and return value, I support (almost) all types without causing garbage, nor loosing any data (boolean does not convert to double, but does not cause garbage by autoboxing either, AFAIK, so it's OK not to support it explicitly). Since all primitive types, except boolean and long, can safely, and implicitly be converted to double, I have almost all my needs covered. That is where the question comes from: if I don't add explicit support for long in that API, how to prevent long being used at all, as it would leading to bugs? And of course, using java.lang.Double instead of double would cause garbage, and therefore make the API pointless. Before anyone asks, I'll say that I want to use the API in real-time Android games where "garbage" is a real issue, unlike the JVM.
I randomly see the following error in the logs when using WebSphere Liberty Core (WLC: 8.5.5.1 (wlp-1.0.3.20130510-0831)). On other application servers, this does not happen. I do not know where in code does this occur... It almost looks like Spring 3.1.3 is trying to do something out of order. Has anyone ever tackled this?

My web project is running in Tomcat 7. My server provider has already a MySql server, however I want to use H2 as it give me a lot more flexibility and speed. My server provider has impose me a limitation that said that I should not start a new thread, doing so will automatically result in a tomcat stop. My project is in an alpha near beta stage, so it is been tested locally. I am getting an SqlException Locked by another process often. This is happening when Tomcat updates the thread pool, most of the times happend when automatically publishing from Eclipse (which it is not a deal, as it won't happend on the server) but some times it just happends randomly. My application doesn't access the database directly but through a wrapper that I am confident about it is not creating the issue but also prevents it to happend a lot. It looks like Tomcat it is sending the thread that holds the connection to the background and any foreground thread will fail (my app it is database intensive). Open a connection in server mode will fix the problem, but it will run in a new process which I'm not aloud to. I will like to keep H2, so before I have to switch to MySql I will need a solution for any of the following answers: Can I somehow connect to embedded H2 without Tomcat thread pool collisions? Can I connect to server mode H2 without H2 creating a new process? Note: I can not post any actual code. I am sure is not my application issue. I don't think it is necessary but I will write a description of how my wrapper handle the connection if required, but the problem has been identified as explained above.
I am trying to implement an SSL proxy server in Java that does not raise certificate errors in the browser. I understand that I will need to process the "CONNECT" request, do an SSL handshake thus requiring that I create a sever certificate and store that in the keystore which I will initialize for the SSL socket. But the browser will always have to verify the server certificate returned and throw the warning error if; 1.The CA certificate is not trusted, but this can be overcome by installing the CA certificate used in signing the server certificate once in the browser. 2.The CN of the certificate does not match the hostname of the website being requested. For this second issue, I implemented using BouncyCastle a certificate generation thread, that uses the hostname being requested to generate a certificate that is signed with the trusted CA private key from above. Then I add the server certificate generated and it's private key into the keystore using the hostname as the alias for the key entry. Now comes the part I can't seem to get a hold of, how do I get to use different certificates for the handshake depending on the hostname being requested. I have seen so many suggestions talking about keymanagers and sslcontext but none of that seem to be able to dynamically change the certificate used for sslhandshake depending on the differing hostname being requested. I am sorry for the very verbose question, I am new to all this, so please be a little patient with me. EDIT: Considering implementing a keymanager and initializing sslcontext with it, and creating the serversocket, at the moment when the serversocket is being created there is no hostname being requested, so how do I create a keymanager that is dynamic unlike the fixedserveralias examples I have seen around.
I am having great difficulty installing these AngularJS plugins for Eclipse. The 'Install new software' dialog tells me that it 'could not find' the update site, and the 'No repository found at [url]' exception is raised. The update site is http://oss.opensagres.fr/angularjs-eclipse/0.2.0/ . I can navigate to this page just fine on my browser and see the content.jar, artifacts.jar, etc. Additionally, other update sites seem to work fine, the problem seems specific to this repository. The same error occurs in earlier versions of Eclipse on this computer, and the error does not occur on other computers. Things I have tried: Basically every solution from this question: Eclipse Kepler doesn't allow me to install plugins Proxy settings seem correct Tried specifying the port in the URL Made sure eclipse is pointing at the right JRE I have also tried variations on the solution provided here for a manual install: http://prabhugs.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/angularjs-in-eclipse-ide/ But the maven tycho plugin download gives me checksum fails and 'invalid extension descriptor' errors. (Probably another problem entirely).
I have a servlet based application running on tomcat(7.0.53), oracle jvm (1.7.x) and CentOS(6.5). There is a script that peridically "sainity checks" the application by issuing GET request to it (every 10sec). I am encountering the following issue: When under normal (moderate) load (~4k parallel connections), some of the sanity checks fail with connect timeout (approximately every 10th to 20th request fails). The connection timeout configured on the client is 120s. This is happning ONLY when connecting to 127.0.0.1 (loopback), connecting to <IP> of the real lan interface (eth0) does not have this issue*. So: curl <args> http://127.0.0.1:<port> fails, curl <args> http://1.2.3.4:<port> does not fail. Running tcpdump show that the server side does not send back SYN-ACK in the failed cases. Note: Out of curiosity, I disabled IPv6 support (net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1) and the issue dissapeared. Before, IPv6 is not used, but IPv6 for the loopback (lo) interface was initialized and the application was bound to all available interfaces (127.0.0.1, ::1 and <IP>). On the eth interface IPv6 was not initialized at all. What are the possilbe reasons for this kind of behaviour? Any ideas for furthure troubleshooting this issue?
I often randomly receive "R can not be resolved variable" errors, and when it happens I can never fix them unless I create a new project and copy and paste all the code. I think this shows that these are not errors from my code. I have cleaned the projects, restarted eclipse, my computer, and even reinstalled Eclipse, but none of those work. I Have noticed that the gen file (Generated auto file) does not contain any file. I have not deleted them my self and this has frequently happened before. I know that many people has posted questions on this topics but they have never worked for me and they usually receive low rating so not many people comments on them either. Also if it requires cmd or terminal, please give the commands for Windows, Linux/Mac. I use Mac. I have recently installed GooglePlayService in the SDK although it worked after I installed it. I am very sorry for lack of useful information, as I have no idea what the issue is. Here are some of my screen shots to show MainActivity.java, Package explorer and res.values.strings.xml. I apologize for describing the situation in a confusing way but I tried my best, please tell me what you find confusing if you do find this confusing. Aftr all Thank You Very Much!!!

I have been coding in Java for work but everything I know about Java comes from googling how to do anything whenever I need to know. I have done C/C++ at school before and now I'm just getting into exception handling in Java. In Java, why should we specify the exception type in the catch block? What are some advantages to doing so? What are some disadvantages to just using Exception instead of, say "IOException"? Also when should I use the try/catch block when coding? I noticed that I got into the pattern of just coding the logic part, and I only add try/catch if an error shows while coding telling me to add it, or when I run the code and the program quits halfway because of an exception, then I find where it happens in the code and add the try/catch block there to "handle the exception" in order to get the code keep running. Is this how people normally decide where to add in try/catch? Is there a more efficient way such as "when doing certain things in code, add try/catch"? Thanks a lot! EDIT: When should I use try/catch blocks and when should I use private void method() throws Exception? What's the difference between the two besides the syntax?
My tests were running fine but then I had to reinstall Eclipse. Now even the simplest test fails with the following error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/hamcrest/SelfDescribing I've tried following the advice in responses to similar questions but I cannot resolve the error.

can any one help me with this error message . while try to compile project in eclipse using jNetpcap API I followed all the steps mentioned on the website below ,how to setup the environment on Debian distribution http://jnetpcap.com/compile/debian though I still get the following error message choosedevice ... OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: You have loaded library /usr/lib/libjnetpcap.so.1.3.b0003 which might have disabled stack guard. The VM will try to fix the stack guard now.

PS : I can't find any ".deb" to install this library for 64 bit.
So I had the GlassVoice.jar VoiceListener working on Glass until I changed a few things. One was that I upgraded Glass to XE18.11, and the other was that I moved the VoiceListener to its own thread outside of the main activity. Now when I run the code, I get the following error: 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): FATAL EXCEPTION: main 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): Process: com.myapp, PID: 5425 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown URI type: 1279544898 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:1469) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:1419) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at com.google.glass.voice.IVoiceService$Stub$Proxy.setConfig(Unknown Source) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at com.google.glass.input.VoiceInputHelper.setVoiceConfig(Unknown Source) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at com.myapp.voice_recognition.VoiceRecognitionThread$MyVoiceListener.onVoiceServiceConnected(VoiceRecognitionThread.java:183) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at com.google.glass.input.VoiceInputHelper.dispatchVoiceServiceConnected(Unknown Source) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at com.google.glass.input.VoiceInputHelper.access$400(Unknown Source) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at com.google.glass.input.VoiceInputHelper$2.handleMessage(Unknown Source) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:102) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:149) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5061) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:515) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:786) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:602) 06-24 12:46:35.844: E/AndroidRuntime(5425): at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method) I thought something might have changed with the jar because of the software upgrade, so I repulled the GlassVoice apk and redid the apk->jar process, but when I use the new jar I can't even upload the app because I run out of memory. I don't really know why that happens. Any thoughts? The code is the same as when it worked, but if you need to see it I can provide it. UPDATE: I used git to go back to before I moved the listener to a new thread. This version worked 100% on XE12. It now does not work, same error. Same memory issues when trying to use the new jar. Thoughts?
I am creating a application where i am trying to integrate openOCD debugger into netbeans. I have already created a TopComponent UI to do all openOCD commands(like flashing, halt,resume,laoding to RAM..etc) and also made the netbeans C/C++ debugger to connect to the openOCD telnet session. However i have to synchronize the openOCD UI w.r.t the netbeans C/C++ debugger UI, for this i need to capture various events of the C/C++ UI debugger like 1. Start of debugger --> inorder to perfrom some startup operations. 2. Continue button/action, kill button/action ...etc. The reason why i need to do this is that when i connect gdb to openOCD telnet session, the state of the target is controlled by gdb & not by openOCD telnet, so in this cases if user tries to do some openOCD commands (via telnet window like flashing, halting, resuming ...etc) it may cause unexpected problems, to avoid this i need to synchronize the entire UI. I tried to look into the Debugger API & netbeans CND(C/C++) debugger but to no avail, Could someone please help me. Thanks.
I have read that we must be careful while coding synchronized blocks or methods because if a thread exits from a synchronized method/block because of an exception, the synchronization lock is released cause the memory model couldn't care less about whether a thread exited because of an exception. So the synchronization lock is going to be available for grabs by other threads even though the object might be in a corrupted state. So if we consider best practices, are there any guidelines that we could follow for writing synchronized methods/blocks. Personally I think locks are quite good because of their try {} finally {} semantics but if we have an API that needs to absolutely have the synchronized methods/blocks, what would be a good approach of coding these synchronized methods/blocks. I thought that it might be good to also employ the try finally approach for the synchronized methods but then the StringBuffer class does not use that approach. I'm not sure if any of the standard classes that have synchronized methods use that approach. So then should leaving the logging part to an uncaughtExceptionHandler be the way out? Are there any other good practices that could come in handy? Is there a way to prevent other threads from acquiring the synchronization lock, should an object's state get corrupted. UncaughtExceptionHandlers and finally blocks can at the most perform additional logging. Would that be right? They can't really prevent other threads from subsequently acquiring the synchronization lock. Would that be right? So then how should we code the synchronized methods/blocks in Java?
When something fails on the server side because the database and the application are out of sync instead of getting an error and the application crashing spring/tomcat seems to swallow the exception and pretend nothing has happened. Call me crazy but if the program fails catastrophically I want it to actually fail catastrophically! Is there anyway to switch this behaviour off? It's really slowing development down when the server pretends that everything is fine when it's just thrown up into the logs. If this isn't the spring/tomcat default then what else might be causing it? We are using a boatload of libraries and frameworks unfortunately. Spring would be the usual suspect but it could be something else. Update It's a sql server database which we are connecting to using SqlServerDataSource. Hibernate is in use in some parts of the project but is used to query the database at login time. On the client side we are using extjs and we are also using ExtDirectSpring to annotate methods for the client side to talk to. To translate the data going across the wire there's Jackson, which then gets wrapped by the extdirect json handler. There's some AOP stuff going on thats to do with logging exceptions but deleting that code results in the same behaviour. Further update Ok its not a good idea to let your sever crash! See my answer below for my proposed middle ground.
I have an OSGi service which I have exposed with CXF as a simple web service and for which I have created a client which invokes its methods. The methods of this service accept as one of their arguments a signed ticket which identifies the client performing the request. In order to inject this ticket to all requests coming from my client I have created a CXF out interceptor, which I have bound to the SETUP phase, and which is responsible for the injection of the ticket in the outgoing message. In case the ticket injected by my interceptor has expired, the service will throw an exception which I would like to be able to catch, get a fresh ticket and repeat the request with this fresh ticket in order to completely abstract the ticket-management functionality from the rest of my code. I have therefore created an in fault interceptor, which I have bound to the PRE_LOGICAL phase and in which I am able to identify whether the specific exception type I am interested in has been thrown. I am however unsure as to how I can repeat the request and return the result of the second request instead of the first one. Does CXF offer a way for me to do this?

In the oracle Java documentation located here, the following is said: Atomic actions cannot be interleaved, so they can be used without fear of thread interference. However, this does not eliminate all need to synchronize atomic actions, because memory consistency errors are still possible. Using volatile variables reduces the risk of memory consistency errors, because any write to a volatile variable establishes a happens-before relationship with subsequent reads of that same variable. This means that changes to a volatile variable are always visible to other threads. What's more, it also means that when a thread reads a volatile variable, it sees not just the latest change to the volatile, but also the side effects of the code that led up the change. It also says: Reads and writes are atomic for reference variables and for most primitive variables (all types except long and double). Reads and writes are atomic for all variables declared volatile (including long and double variables). I have two questions regarding these statements: "Using volatile variables reduces the risk of memory consistency errors" - What do they mean by "reduces the risk", and how is a memory consistency error still possible when using volatile? Would it be true to say that the only effect of placing volatile on a non-double, non-long primitive is to enable the "happens-before" relationship with subsequent reads from other threads? I ask this since it seems that those variables already have atomic reads.
I want to write a gwt-test-utils test to test the composite widget I created. After spending some time getting started, the JUnit test is finally starting up, I can initialize the widget and even access private fields. However here is the show stopper: my widget uses another widget which extends ComplexPanel. Whenever I try to call its insertChild method, I get the following exception java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: com.google.gwt.user.client.impl.DOMImplStandard.insertChild(Lcom/google/gwt/user/client/Element;Lcom/google/gwt/user/client/Element;I)V at com.google.gwt.user.client.impl.DOMImplStandard.insertChild(Native Method) at com.google.gwt.user.client.impl.DOMImplMobileSafari.insertChild(DOMImplMobileSafari.java:26) at com.google.gwt.user.client.DOM.insertChild(DOM.java:958) at com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.ComplexPanel.insert(ComplexPanel.java:203) [...] I read about gwt-test-utils' Patcher API and took a look at its source code. DOMImplStandard extends DOMImpl. There is a PatchClass for DOMImpl with a PatchMethod for insertChild (DOMImplUserPatcher). But for some reason the patching does not seem to work for me. I tried writing my own patch for DOMImpl.insertChild which resulted in com.googlecode.gwt.test.exceptions.GwtTestPatchException: 2 @PatchMethod methods detected for the same target... After that I wrote a patch for DOMImplMobileSafari.insertChild and that did work! But I do not want to copy DOMImplUserPatcher just to apply it to DOMImplMobileSafari and still think that something is not working as expected for me. Any idea what I am doing wrong?
I have a Java web app that deploys as a WAR to Tomcat 7.0.41 (myapp.war). I noticed that when I deploy the WAR to a Tomcat that lives in one part of our network, the web pages display perfectly fine. However, and this only happens in IE 11, if I take the exact same WAR and deploy it to the exact same version/Chef-configured-instance of a Tomcat server that lives in another part of our network, the page stylings look way different and completely wrong. Again, this is specific to IE11 and the location in the network that the app is served from. If I go to the app in IE 11 from a "good" location on the network, the frontend renders perfectly fine. Or if I view the app from a "bad" location on the network, but in a non-IE browser, again all is well. I have a feeling that we might have some IT proxy (nginx, etc.) that is preventing Tomcat from serving certain CSS/JS files, and so the end result is a partially-complete frontend that looks all wonky in the browser. And somehow, this only crops up in IE 11. I have (sort of) confirmed this by viewing the source of all my HTML, JS and CSS files and copying them to files in a local folder. I then open up one of the HTML files (locally) in a browser and the site displays perfectly. The problem here is that my JS files use a bunch of open source JS libraries. And those libraries have dependencies on other libraries. So on and so forth, and the dependency graph is pretty huge. It's tough for me to tell which files are not being downloaded properly/completely. Here's the kicker: if I add in html5shiv to my app then the problem goes away entirely, no matter which browser (IE or not) or what location in the network I choose. However adding html5shiv breaks other things in my app, and for reasons outside the context of this question, can't be used. Anyone have any idea how I could troubleshoot/fix this? Why would this only be affecting IE 11 and not other browsers? Why is html5shiv solving this?!?
Im trying to deploy a simple Java EE app on heroku cloud using Cedar stack. Im getting “java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/app/myApp/main : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 (unable to load class com.app.myApp.main" Which means that Im compiling with a higher JDK version than the heroku JVM version. I specified “java.runtime.version=1.7” in my “system.properties” file. I tried JDK to recompile with these other JDK versions: • jdk1.7.0_55 • jdk1.7.0_51 • jdk1.7.0_07 For example when I tried "jdk1.7.0_07" , in order to confirm that Im using the correct JDK version jdk1.7.0_07 to compile , I issued "javac -version" , got: Than I also check that Eclipse is using the correct JDK version jdk1.7.0_07: Than i compile & create WAR using "mvn clean package" , than i deployed using "heroku deploy:war --war myApp.war --app myApp" But I still get: “java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/app/myApp/main : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 (unable to load class com.app.myApp.main" And than I tried JDK 6 version , just in case Heroku JVM was versio 6 Using system.properties file “java.runtime.version=1.6 • jdk1.6.0_45 • jdk1.6.0_34 I compiled/packaged & deployed , but I still get: “java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/app/myApp/main : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 (unable to load class com.app.myApp.main" Finally said this is enough , and tried to run “heroku run bash” so I can remote into heroku & try to find the JVM version by; either issuing “java –version” or "cd" into “.jdk” path & actually inspect what JVM that is being used, but I kept keep getting “Timeout awaiting process”…** with no bash console.** Therefore what is the actual JVM version installed on Heroku instance & how can one find out??? Thanks
I've encountered an issue with the OpenID option for the users API in Google App Engine that is limited to apps running on a custom domain. When I test my app it works fine in the appspot domain and localhost debugger but crashes on the custom one that I added through the control panel. I managed to get the login with Google Accounts working by asking for the domain to be registered on Google's deprecated OpenID 2 API but the login for any other OpenID account still crashes to an app engine 500 page. It seems that the app engine API just isn't expecting calls from my custom domain. I can get any screenshots or code snippets that you need to find the issue. I'm also running this in the Java runtime and currently have it in the free quota (so I can't contact Google's support). I did manage to set up a temporary work around for this by redirecting users trying to sign in with non-Google accounts to my appspot domain but this is far from ideal. Any suggestions?
I am using Google Play Location Services in my Android app and while debugging it, the code execution stops at this ClassNotFoundException instead of the breakpoints that I have set. The class in question (ParcelableGeofence) seems to belong to the Location Services API. I had added the Google Play Services library strictly following the instructions in the documentation and the app runs fine on the phone - this problem occurs only in the debug mode. I have double checked to make sure that Google Play library project is present in Eclipse workspace as a library, is referenced by my project and the play services jar is present in the libs folder of my project. What else can we try to fix this issue or work around it? I am not able to debug other code because this error suspends the VM while debugging. Please see the image of my debug perspective for this error below: EDIT: To clarify, this error occurs when I debug on my phone that has the latest version of Google Play Services installed. So this does not have to do with the emulator not having the Play Services SDK.
I am working on a large (15MB) legacy 32bit app written in C++Builder 6 that needs to use a third party API to interact with an outside system. The API consists of a groups of DLLs that internally use Java (I am assuming JNI). Our code only interacts with one particular DLL directly, and it is delay-loaded at runtime. When the app is run on a customer's system, the DLL is crashing for unknown reasons. So I tried to reproduce on my system (XP Pro 32bit) and ran into a different problem. The app creates a thread that attempts to initialize the API, which internally attempts to load the Java JVM and fails, and the API reports a "JVM create failure" error back to my code. However, the exact same thread code running in a small test app works, Java loads just fine and the API functions normally. Both apps are run from the same folder, so it is not a path issue locating the API DLLs or the Java JVM DLLs. I also made sure both projects are using the same compiler/linker settings for memory usage, heap size, alignment, processor type, etc. I saw a reference online suggesting that the JVM needs the address space of the calling process to have a large section of contiguous memory available, is this true? If so, how much? I tried enabling logging/tracing in the Java control panel, but nothing useful was logged. Is there any way to find out why Java is failing to load when called by the main app, but not the test app?
I'm trying to figure out how to debug my jar that is running remotely. Here is my scenario: My .jar will be running from a VPS. This jar basically runs a server for a game, so it also connects to a mysql db. I start the server with 3 .bat files that looks something like this: set CLASSPATH=.;dist\aries.jar;dist\mina-core.jar;dist\slf4j-api.jar;dist\slf4j-jdk14.jar;dist\mysql-connector-java-bin.jar java -Xmx500m -Dwzpath=wz\ -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=filename.keystore -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=passwd -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=filename.keystore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=passwd net.world.WorldServer pause What I want to do is start the server on the vps like normal, but debugging the server on my local machine via Netbeans IDE. I don't know if this is possible because people will be connecting to the server (although, I will be debugging a test server which will only have me online). Note: I have done a lot of searching before coming here and a lot of what I found had to do with using xdebug & php which has doesn't have much to do with my situation (I don't think) -Thanks
For years I've been wondering what the correct way to close a listening ServerSocket in Java is. My implementations always work like this, they: Create a new ServerSocket(int). Start a thread that calls its accept() method in a while (true) loop. Start another thread when accept() returns (client connects) that reads from the client until it disconnects. The accept thread then continues with another accept() call. But when I want to close the ServerSocket because my application is exiting, I've never found another way of doing so other than calling it's close() method (after I've closed all client Sockets), which causes accept() to throw a SocketException, I catch that and break from the while (true) loop in the accept thread, causing all my threads to exit. I think this is ugly, strictly speaking there is no exception occurring, closing my ServerSocket is part of my programs normal operation. Is there really no other way of doing this without causing an Exception to be thrown? Thanks.
I have a web site project in Eclipse and I needed to copy it and rename it for a new client. So I had my tortisesvn export the site to a new directory and changed the project name in the .project file and imported it into the same workspace in Eclipse. It seems to be running ok but now when I get errors in the console window the links that should take me to the line of the error take me to the file in the original project not the new one. Anybody know what I can do to fix this? EDIT: In case anyone asks. I'm sure it's using the correct file when running the site and the error number is on the correct line. I put an intentional divide by 0 error in my code to test this and I get the expected error in the console window on the line that the error is on but it still sends me to the same file name but in the other project.

I have a multimodule gwt project that I'm able to start up and run through IntelliJ just fine. But when I go to debug the application (or actually just the act of adding ?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997 to the end of the url) causes me to get the dreaded "Plugin failed to connect to Development Mode server at 127.0.0.1:9997. My current setup is: Entrypoint has a dependency on several portal modules. I'm unsure of what I'm doing wrong, because the portal runs fine as long as it's not through the code server.. Edit: Here is my current run configuration. I've tried everything including changing the -war directory to target\ROOT and src\main\webapp and I've changed the web facet resource folder to the same, I have no clue what I'm doing wrong. Note that I've tried removing and adding the bindAddress several times. It doesn't differently either way.
I have a java program that searches a site for updates. It checks and than sleeps for a period of time set by user. During some testing I set the sleep time to 0 secs, forgot about it and it over-requested (over-spammed?, don't know the terminology) the site. I wouldn't have noticed this if I didn't go to this site and manually checked for something. The error I get is 429 : too many requests. I've searched the web and found out that the site should send me when is it ok to try again (retry-after header). The problem is that I either don't get this information or can't find it. I've viewed the source via chrome and didn't find the information. Then I used getErrorStrem and didn't find the information. In another question on stackoverflow it is said that if everything is set up properly, you will also have received a "Retry-after" header along with the 429 response My knowledge of web technologies is rather limited. The program I wrote looked for patterns that I noticed viewing the source of page. My java knowledge is better, but not great. So how do I get retry-after info? About 20 hours passed and when I tried again I got the same error.
I have many different versions of my app. Each one is a separate intellij project. Every time I open a new one, the list of configurations starts blank: The annoying thing about this is I deploy to 1 vm and I have to copy and paste the debug configurations each time I want to test a different version. Intellij makes this dialog modal per Intellij Instance, so I can't copy and paste the fields between Project Instances. I end up taking a screenshot of one configuration and copying the fields by hand into the other project. It's a pretty primitive solution. Is there a more convenient way to get a run configuration from one project to another? I'm using Intellij 13 on Windows 7. Can I share settings for IntelliJ Idea across different projects? may have the answer to this, but the question is different. It's about window layout. Therefore I don't consider it a duplicate.
I downloaded an Open Source tool from www.openempi.org used to find duplicate patients. It is referred to as an EMPI tool (Enterprise Master Patient Index). I am a .Net programmer and not a Java programmer, but I have worked with other Java products where I receive a Jar file and run it like a Windows executable. The zip file contained several Jar files but when I double-click on them I get Failed to load Main-Class manifest from.... After I Googled this term and reading a few posts about it, including several on this site, this seems to indicate that I should have done something different when creating the Jar file, but I didn't create the Jar file. Will I need to use Eclipse or some other tool to get past this, or is there something I'm doing wrong when try to load the Jar? Could it be a Java version issue? The zip also contained a ./conf folder with several XML, CSV, and SQL files. Greg

I created nested method tree which looks in nutshell like this: This is simplified picture, which should help in understanding what I'm talking about. And the question is, how is the best approach to inform shallow level of methods that something deeper goes wrong. For example, one object can't be found, the calculation for this data are impossible to do or other stuff, so the situations when is no point to invoke deeper methods. Here I would say, what immediately comes to my mind when I encountered this problem. First solution when something goes wrong is to return table of double with chosen set of data, which would mean for shallow level methods that calculation deeper went wrong. Second solution is to throw exception and catch it on the shallow level of method tree. Which approach is better and called "good practice" in this case? What's in your opinion is the solution of this problem?
I am facing a big issue while building a project through jenkins which is in a remote server. Now this being a headless system i get a headless exception. I came across this post in stack overflow to use the Xvnc pluggin. How to fix java.awt.HeadlessException in Jenkins on Linux Now the jenkins which i use in the server, has already this pluggin (Since this is hosted by my company). Under the build Environment of Jenkins i have this option "Run Xvnc during build". I check this and start building my project i get the error as $ vncserver :39 -localhost -nolisten tcp You will require a password to access your desktops. In the stack overflow solution posted before, it says to install VNC and all those stuff. Where should i install VNC? I dont have access to the server since that is secured environment. i can't understand steps 3 to 6. Should i run a bash script with the build process for that? I am new to jenkins and i am having trouble following that post

I've been working on a project for some time now that's targeting a minimum of 4.0 ICS. Recently, I got a new Play Edition Moto G that, after running all updates, is running 4.4 (KK). So I decided I wanted to try and deploy the program on it as well as the other two test devices that I have. Everything was going fine until my program got to a point where it was trying to access SharedPreference via PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(Context). After debugging and running through each frame, I was able to figure out that values are in fact written to the preferences file (or at least appear to be since the Map container in the SharedPreference object contains the values I put there previously). However when I attempt to read any of the values with their respective keys, I'm getting a INSTALL_FAILED_SHARED_USER_INCOMPATIBLE value instead and that's causing my program to crash (not directly but it's causing proceeding functions that require the proper output from Preferences to fail). This only happens on 4.4 to my knowledge. I've scoured the net and SO for answers on this and I can't seem to find anything that solves my problem. My manifest doesn't declare a sharedUserId or sharedUserLabel so I don't think that would be causing the issue. I've uninstalled and re-installed the package quite a few times to no avail. I was under the impression that the XML file used for SharedPreference was written to the program's local directory which I understood to grant at least read/write access by the program itself (unless this is what changed in 4.4). And it doesn't appear to be storing that location on a external source since the Moto G has no SD Card in it. Does anyone have any idea how to work around this? As it stands now, my program isn't able to be deployed on 4.4 devices and I would really like for that not to be the case.
Ok so i'm stupid problems right now.. I'm trying to use google play services in my app. i have referenced the library, google play serves, in both my app and BaseGameUtils, and then i references google play services as a library to the BaseGameUtiles librbary, and I get this issue.. Unable to execute dex: Multiple dex files define Lcom/google/android/gms/ads/AdActivity; " usually what that means is that you have two .jar files that have the same class name. My only problem is I don't know which jar files have the same classes. Also, I do not have google-play-services as a jar in my libs folder nor have i added it as an external jar in the "java build path" menu. So all i have are two dependencies google-play-servies, and BaseGameUtils, which also uses google-play-servies as a library. but in the "private libraries" i drop down option for all the .jars i added and then it also has google-play-services included in there. which i don't think should be there.. If i uncheck the "private libraries" option, it load but then i get a "NoClassDefFoundError Android Project" error. I updated ADT to 23.0.2 or what ever the newest one is for today 7/13/14 - so here's the jist of the problem if i check the "private libraries" option i get multiple dex files issue, i think it has something to do with android support libraries v4. but does "Multiple dex files define Lcom/google/android/gms/ads/AdActivity;" is the error i get. if i uncheck the option "private libraries" i get NoClassDefFoundError ugh.. can someone tell me what's going on please. here is a picture of what i did.. after you asked me to do.. mr.. rahandandn (sorry for butchering your name) and here's more problems it shows me.. here is the java build path menu option fo basegameutiles.. trying to use google play services for leader boards and achievements. they say use google play services as a library for both your application and for BaseGameUtils. they also say use google plat services as a library for BaseGameUtils. when i do that.. i get "Unable to execute dex: Multiple dex files define Lcom/google/android/gms/ads/AdActivity; " that means two jar files of the same name or something like that has the same class names.. ok so that means delete the duplicate.. but guy's where is it? this is the java build path and order export for google play services.. here's some info on BaseGameUtils and finally my app that im working with..
Since yesterday, I have been receiving an error every time I try to run a program in Eclipse. Pretty much I will edit pieces of my code and then will click the run button, which will give me the error. After I click OK and try to run again, it will work. The problem is this is happening every time I try to run after modifying code and is getting very annoying. It does not matter which project I am working on in my workspace, it happens in all of them. When in my project, the main class is called TSTMain. The error I am getting is: 'Launching TSTMain' has encountered a problem. Errors occurred during the build. And clicking the details button brings up: Errors occurred during the build. Errors running builder 'Checkstyle Builder' on project 'TwitterSmileTracker'. unable to parse configuration stream - White spaces are required between publicId and systemId.:1:50 unable to parse configuration stream - White spaces are required between publicId and systemId.:1:50 unable to parse configuration stream - White spaces are required between publicId and systemId.:1:50 unable to parse configuration stream - White spaces are required between publicId and systemId.:1:50 Obviously, it has something to do with Checkstyle. I am unsure why this began just yesterday. I uninstalled Checkstyle and reinstalled it but the problem still occurs. If anyone has any suggestions on how I could make this stop, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

We have an automated batch that runs every day to synchronise users between an internal users MYSQL table and google accounts. Since the end of may (2014/05/29), this batch is failing because each request to create or update users results in the following response : 503 Service Unavailable { "code" : 503, "errors" : [ { "domain" : "global", "message" : "Backend Error", "reason" : "backendError" } ], "message" : "Backend Error" } The only information I could find in the help center about 503 errors is that it comes from a quota being reached. Looking at the graphs available in the API console shows that we are well below the defined quota (150K/day), over the last 28 days period we did not even reach 0.05% of that quota. Has anyone got an idea why we get that error since the quota doesn't seem to be the issue? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers, Etienne Bömcke
I have an app which uses an instance of the Socket class to communicate with a server. I use the streams returned by socket.getInputStream() and socket.getOutputStream() to read and write data. When my Android app is always "active" (not minimized), there is no problem with the communication. It does not matter how long the connection lasts. When I "pause" the application and re-open it quickly, everything still works fine. However, when I pause the application for about 5 minutes and re-open it, the InputStream shows strange behavior: it stops reading anything. I get timeout errors instead of the data sent by the server. The connection is still alive, the server is able to write and read. isInputShutdown() on the client-side returns false. Using a network analysis tool, I can also see that the data sent by the server IN FACT reaches the client but it somehow does not get recognized by the InputStream ... However, writing data from the client to the server using the OutputStream works fine. Maybe it's worth mentioning that the socket object and the streams are declared as static to be accessible for all the activities of the app. But as I don't have any problems with the OutputStream, I cannot imagine that this could be the reason. The only workaround I have at this point is to close the whole socket and connect a new one to the server. But this is causing unnecessary network traffic because I have to handshake again. It would be better not to do it this way. If anyone has had similar experience and found a solution, I would be really happy if you could share it with me.

I am trying to run a Java Web Start application developed by me but when I run the jnlp, I get a security warning about the "Permissions" attribute being missing in the Manifest and the application does not run. I'm unable to understand why this happens as my manifest has the permissions attribute set in it using the line: Permissions: all-permissions Why is it then that running the Web Start says that the permissions attribute is missing ? Do I also have to include the attribute in every jar (in 'lib') that my code uses. If so, how do I modify 3rd party jars & set the permissions attribute in the Manifest ? Feedback on how to resolve this issue would be great. Thanks. Update [16/07/14]: I've now added the Application-Name attribute in my jar's manifest file and re-signed it. When I run the jnlp now, there is no manifest permissions warning. I have left the 3rd party jars untouched so far. However, when the application starts the WebStart Console still states: "Missing Application-Name manifest attribute" & "Missing permissions manifest attribute". How do I solve this problem ? Latest Update [18/07/14] Hi, I've managed to make my WebStart application run. However, it now first brings up a popup with the jar & its certificate's details. It then shows another popup with an error. I saw a post here with the same issue at Java Web Start manifest issue which provides the following solution: In jnlpcomponent1.jnlp i see that sqljdbc4.jar is already signed by microsoft. When i was looking to its manifest.mf it hasn't the attribute Permissions: all-permissions. So i delete all manifest file from sqljdbc4.jar and put an empty one (delete MSFTSIG.SF and MSFTSIG.RSA also). Build application again now with my signature and with Permissions: all-permissions in manifest file and works like a charm. In my application, the 'jnlpcomponent1.jnlp' file contains four 3rd party jars that are already signed. My question is how do I unpack these jar's (to replace the Manifest with a blank one & delete the .SF and .HSA files) & re-pack it ? Please let me know. Thanks. Update [21/07/14]: I have managed to resolve this issue myself. Thanks.
I've got a large web application (running on weblogic 11g) that uses a combination of spring, spring-security, mybatis and mybatis-spring. It uses mybatis:scan with a marker-interface (DataAccess) to wire the SqlSessionFactory into our DAOs. We have 61 classes (interfaces) that extend the marker interface. When we add one more interface that extends DataAccess (the marker) the application fails to start. I'd like to know if anyone can help figure out why adding one more DataAccess causes the application to get these errors. I can provide any information that will help figure this out but I didn't know what to include in my initial question. Here are the first two errors in the log4j log file: 2014-Jul-14 12:58:22.659 [ACTIVE] ExecuteThread: '40' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)' DEBUG org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory Ignoring bean creation exception on FactoryBean type check: org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'paymentsDataAccess' defined in file [/opt/..../tmp/_WL_user/..../an9ko4/APP-INF/classes/com/..../payment/app/dao/PaymentsDataAccess.class]: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through bean property 'sqlSessionFactory': : Error creating bean with name 'sqlSessionFactory' defined in class path resource [ServiceConfig.xml]: Instantiation of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.StackOverflowError; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'sqlSessionFactory' defined in class path resource [ServiceConfig.xml]: Instantiation of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.StackOverflowError 2014-Jul-14 12:58:22.666 [ACTIVE] ExecuteThread: '40' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)' DEBUG org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory Ignoring bean creation exception on FactoryBean type check: org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'adminSessionDataAccess' defined in file [/opt/..../tmp/_WL_user/..../an9ko4/APP-INF/classes/com/..../dao/AdminSessionDataAccess.class]: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through bean property 'sqlSessionFactory': : Error creating bean with name 'sqlSessionFactory' defined in class path resource [ServiceConfig.xml]: Instantiation of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'sqlSessionFactory' defined in class path resource [ServiceConfig.xml]: Instantiation of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean The first error has the nested exception of a StackOverflowError and when I've looked at a generated stack trace the call stack is over 1000 methods deep. I can provide the stack trace if asked but it's so big I didn't want to include it unless there is interest. The PaymentsDataAccess class isn't special in any way - it's just like the other data access classes in the application. When the application doesn't start there also seems to be another error (in server.log) but I'm not sure if it's related: java.lang.instrument ASSERTION FAILED: "!errorOutstanding" with message transform method call failed at ../../../src/share/instrument/JPLISAgent.c line: 805
I'm currently getting errors like: 07-15 21:26:43.216: E/dalvikvm(1066): Could not find class 'pctelelog.events.AbstractEvent', referenced from method com.aberdyne.droidnavi.client.EventDispatchThread.dequeueEvent When I try and run on an API16 emulator. The AbstractEvent exists within another Eclipse Java project. The Android App uses them to simplify talking to the Java server. The Project was added to the Android project in the Java Build Path > Projects tab. Before anyone asks, I have gone into the Android Build Path > Order and Export and checked the Project to export. I have tried cleaning the project, building, I have tried placing the project at the top of the export order, "Fix Properties," re-downloading support libraries. I've tried everything I can think of, even going so far as deleting my eclipse installation and redownloading the latest one. Here's the truly bizarre part. I'm getting the "Could not find class" errors (which lead to NoClassDefFound when the class needs to be instantiated) on my Windows development machine. However, when I pull an exact copy of the same source tree off Git onto my Mac and build the app in Eclipse, no problems! Hell, I pulled an earlier release of my app from the repository that I know I built on my windows machine and now that doesn't build either. The settings appear to match in every way. The major difference between my Windows and Mac are the ADT version. Windows running ADT 23.0 and Mac 22.6. They were running the same version of Eclipse before I deleted the Window one but now Mac is Kepler and Win, Luna. Any suggestions on what else I could try to get this to export right? Is this a bug in Eclipse?
I have an unfortunate Java library that I've inherited that parses JSON. Right now, if you ask for a key that doesn't exist in a JSON array, it dies with a null pointer. I'm going to edit the library to do something more reasonable. I think I have two options: 1) Return null so the caller can check 2) Throw a more explicit exception (more descriptive than "Null Pointer"), forcing the caller to handle the case where they asked for a non-existent key. I come from a python background and am strongly drawn to number 2, seeing as it will ensure that some bonehead can't call this function and then continue on with a null value, crashing their application later on and possibly corrupting data. Which way do YOU think is more in line with best practices of Java? This is not a duplicate of other language-independent questions on the same topic. This is specifically in the context of Java!!!!
Fresh Ubuntu 14.04 install alongside windows 8.1 on brand new system and HDD *UEFI partition. First steps I took on Ubuntu 14.04 was installing open-jdk-7 and Eclipse with ADT and everything worked correctly. I wanted Oracle-JDK-7 and to remove open-jdk-7. I first removed eclipse adt, removed all updates/installs from ADT Package manager then removed open-jdk-7 I installed the Oracle-JDK-7 via the terminal then I reinstalled eclipse adt. eclipse adt will not run correctly or at all now. the errors I am getting (Not exact word for word) *This program will not run, cannot locate adb ddms tools *Android-sdk-linux/ directory does not exist or cannot locate file or no such archive when I point eclipse (from within eclipse) to the android-sdk it then switches the error to "cannot run program missing adb ddms tools" my own troubleshooting so far re-installed open-jdk-7 alongside oracle-jdk-7 and set default version and default javac to both open-jdk-7 *which I decided I want. Installed android-sdk standalone (with eclipse removed from system) and extracted to the home directory From the terminal I entered the directory and bash does not recognize android-sdk-linux claiming there is no such file or directory even though it is clearly there. I believe I narrowed the problem down to just the Android-sdk which includes the platform tools, not being found for some reason... I am new to Linux... I do not know how to set JAVA_HOME in linux/ubuntu 14.04 (not sure if that is relevant to this issue) I know in windows you must delete metadata. folder before installing eclipse adt again. In my experience, Eclipse Adt always runs perfect on first time install on new system In my experience all errors and unstable behavior from eclipse adt show up after I replace original install (on both windows and linux platforms Eclipse ADT never runs the same as first install) I hope someone may be able to point out something I did or am doing wrong in the current situation and overall as I am stumped as to why Eclipse-ADT will not run after remove and new install. Is there a specific way to completely remove every trace of eclipse ADT? Do I have to create a directory from the terminal for eclipse, eclipse adt, android sdk any combination? Being new to linux I am not even sure if I set up both JDK's correctly or if I caused damage to my overall install. Please go easy on me guys... I checked things out before resorting to asking, in fact this is my very first question as I usually always figure things out on my own... I am really stumped and not quite comfortable enough with linux Ubuntu 14.04 to mess around with my particular situation any further. I humbly ask for precise instruction on how to get eclipse adt to run and behave the way it did on first install... and also if necessary how to set JAVA_HOME (I want open-jdk for building android aosp and oracle jdk for building apps) Is it possible in ubuntu 14.04 to install eclipse adt and have it use open-jdk and install android studio and have it use oracle jdk all on the same ubuntu install... how would I go about creating the directories? I know this is a very lengthy question with alot of details... I must get my Ubuntu 14.04 install production ready asap
We are calling the API to undeploy vApps, during out of hours periods, only to start them up again afterwards. I get an intermittent error whilst trying to undeploy VApps. (I will give the full stack trace later). Just to let you know what I am doing, is that I am calling VApp.shutdown() first, which always seems to return success. I sometimes wait a period of upto 10 minutes, before calling the Vapp.undeploy(UndeployPowerActionType.DEFAULT) call. It still more often than not, doesnt work. When I then run it again, it quite often DOES work (and when I check the result, the Vapp is indeed undeployed), or if it still doesn't work, then when I call it again, it does work. The stack trace looks like the following.. (sometimes the array index is out of range with different numbers, eg -5 or -12 etc etc. Bu the stack trace always looks like the following...) 2014-07-17 13:10:33 ERROR [main] ControlModule:75 - Undeploying resulted in an error java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Array index out of range: -2 at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.util.CollisionCheckStack.findDuplicate(CollisionCheckStack.java:133) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.util.CollisionCheckStack.push(CollisionCheckStack.java:71) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.XMLSerializer.pushObject(XMLSerializer.java:494) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.XMLSerializer.childAsXsiType(XMLSerializer.java:609) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.property.SingleElementNodeProperty.serializeBody(SingleElementNodeProperty.java:113) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.ElementBeanInfoImpl$1.serializeBody(ElementBeanInfoImpl.java:120) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.ElementBeanInfoImpl$1.serializeBody(ElementBeanInfoImpl.java:149) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.ElementBeanInfoImpl.serializeBody(ElementBeanInfoImpl.java:269) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.ElementBeanInfoImpl.serializeRoot(ElementBeanInfoImpl.java:276) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.ElementBeanInfoImpl.serializeRoot(ElementBeanInfoImpl.java:35) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.XMLSerializer.childAsRoot(XMLSerializer.java:472) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.MarshallerImpl.write(MarshallerImpl.java:301) at com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.MarshallerImpl.marshal(MarshallerImpl.java:230) at javax.xml.bind.helpers.AbstractMarshallerImpl.marshal(AbstractMarshallerImpl.java:106) at com.vmware.vcloud.sdk.JAXBUtil.marshal(JAXBUtil.java:199) at com.vmware.vcloud.sdk.AbstractVapp.createVappUnDeployParamBody(AbstractVapp.java:299) at com.vmware.vcloud.sdk.AbstractVapp.undeploy(AbstractVapp.java:318) at com.ipt.ebsa.skyscape.client.module.ControlModule.controlVApp(ControlModule.java:70) at com.ipt.ebsa.skyscape.client.manager.VMManager.controlVApp(VMManager.java:294) at com.ipt.ebsa.skyscape.client.CloudManager.UndeployVApp(CloudManager.java:197) at com.ipt.ebsa.skyscape.client.RajVAppTest.stopAndUndeployVApp(RajVAppTest.java:178) at com.ipt.ebsa.skyscape.client.RajVAppTest.testUndeployVApp0(RajVAppTest.java:121) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:94) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:55) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:619) at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:47) at org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:12) at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:44) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluate(InvokeMethod.java:17) at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:26) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeaf(ParentRunner.java:271) at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:70) at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:50) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:238) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:63) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:236) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:53) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:229) at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:309) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit4.runner.JUnit4TestReference.run(JUnit4TestReference.java:50) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.TestExecution.run(TestExecution.java:38) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTests(RemoteTestRunner.java:467) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTests(RemoteTestRunner.java:683) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.run(RemoteTestRunner.java:390) at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.main(RemoteTestRunner.java:197) 2014-07-17 13:10:33 DEBUG [main] ControlModule:77 - Undeploying of vapp 'TEST_RAJ2' complete 2014-07-17 13:10:33 DEBUG [main] VMManager:296 - controlVApp exit Can someone tell me if I am doing anything wrong? Is it normal practise to just have to retry, and eventually it will work, in order to undeploy my Vapp. If that is the case, and I do have to keep retrying, I can detect this exception, and if I get it, rety a certain number of times before failing finally and giving up? Or is there another way to detect whether the Vapp is undeployed or not? Would calling 'shutdown() rather than undeploy() work better? I think , in my experience, that seems more consistent. However, the resulting vApps in the console are entitled as 'partially running' rather than 'shutdown'. This may well be acceptable, as at the end of the day, we just want our cloud hosting partner to stop charging us for periods when we are not needing the vAPPs. I think shutting down the vAPP might actually achieve this purpose? I would have to check iwth the cloud hosting partner. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks,
This is my first time really playing around with Java development using Eclipse. I am trying to use EclipseLink's implementation of the JPA. I moved all of my entities into a separate package "entities". I have the persistence.xml in a separate JPA project called "dataModeling". Everything builds and runs fine. Just about every project depends on my entities. However, I'm seeing a warning Class javax.persistence.Entity not found - continuing with a stub., etc. showing up because the dependent projects don't reference EclipseLink. The solution is to go into each dependent project's properties and under Java Build Path > Libraries, click Add Library, then User Library and then select EclipseLink. However, to me, it doesn't make sense to reference EclipseLink in every project! That's an implementation detail I don't want to burden other projects with. It looks like this is happening because the other projects see the annotations and don't recognize them. So the real question is: how can I use JPA (via annotations) without every other project needing to reference my JPA implementation?
I'm facing this weird issue where Android Studio just doesn't open anymore. I've been using Android Studio for quite a while now and everything was working great but all of a sudden, it stopped opening for some reason. I am using the following configuration: Android Studio 0.5.9 Java version "1.6.0_51" Mac OS 10.6.8 If it helps, here's the stack trace I was able to fetch from "console": [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.awt.Toolkit [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext$2.run(AppContext.java:237) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext$2.run(AppContext.java:226) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext.initMainAppContext(AppContext.java:226) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext.access$200(AppContext.java:112) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext$3.run(AppContext.java:299) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext.getAppContext(AppContext.java:280) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext$6.getContext(AppContext.java:827) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.misc.SharedSecrets.getJavaAWTAccess(SharedSecrets.java:144) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.LogManager.getUserContext(LogManager.java:321) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.LogManager.getLogger(LogManager.java:894) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.LogManager.demandLogger(LogManager.java:369) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.Logger.demandLogger(Logger.java:290) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.Logger.getLogger(Logger.java:321) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.awt.Component.(Component.java:173) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at com.intellij.idea.Main.showMessage(Main.java:216) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at com.intellij.idea.Main.showMessage(Main.java:203) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at com.intellij.idea.Main.main(Main.java:86) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: Exception in thread "Thread-1" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.awt.Toolkit [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext$2.run(AppContext.java:237) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext$2.run(AppContext.java:226) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext.initMainAppContext(AppContext.java:226) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext.access$200(AppContext.java:112) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext$3.run(AppContext.java:299) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext.getAppContext(AppContext.java:280) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.awt.AppContext$6.getContext(AppContext.java:827) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at sun.misc.SharedSecrets.getJavaAWTAccess(SharedSecrets.java:144) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.LogManager.getUserContext(LogManager.java:321) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.LogManager.contexts(LogManager.java:352) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.LogManager.reset(LogManager.java:999) [0x0-0x67067].com.google.android.studio[2226]: at java.util.logging.LogManager$Cleaner.run(LogManager.java:219) I have tried restarting the machine, reinstalling android studio, reinstalling java, setting java home path, but nothing has helped.

As mentioned in this link Why throwing an EJBException is a "recommended" practice? Specifically, the EJB specification says that if a bean throws a runtime exception (and EJBException is a runtime exception) from the business method, then the bean is discarded without calling ejbRemove on it. question1 : what does 'bean will be discarded' means here ?? do we need to lookup again in that case ?? The throwing of EJBException is recommended by the EJB spec (14.2.2 in the EJB 3) in the cases where the EJB cannot recover from an exception it encounters. The spec also says that the EJB can reasonably allow (unchecked) System Exceptions to propagate to the container Let's consider my ejb method will insert data into 4 tables . If an exception occurs in the code after inserting data in 2 tables, i will not prompt the exception to user for getting a valid data from the user and process it and insert the data in 3rd n 4th table. Instead, i will just ask the user to call the EJB method again with proper data . question 2 : which of the following 3 is better option Both checked and unchecked exceptions in code as EJBException Checked exceptions as customException and unchecked exceptions as EJBException Both checked and unchecked exceptions in code as customException Note : customException is inherited from runtimeException and it is annotated as " @ApplicationException(rollback=true)" Thanks in advance..
I am starting to use hadoop and was reading a lot of tutorials to understand all the steps to start it for the first time. I am running a virtual machine downloaded from the yahoo tutorial with hadoop and java pre-installed. My main problem is: If I start the start-all.sh script (after hadoop namenode -format), I don't get any error, but when I try to connect to the filesystem with hadoop fs ls I get the following erros: 14/07/18 04:49:43 INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connect to server: node1/10.10.104.68:9000. Already tried 0 time(s). ..... 14/07/18 04:49:52 INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connect to server: node1/10.10.104.68:9000. Already tried 9 time(s). Bad connection to FS. command aborted. exception: Call to node1/10.10.104.68:9000 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused While trying to find the solution for this problem I found out the following strange things: 1.) After running stop-all.sh It writes: no jobtracker to stop node1: no tasktracker to stop no namenode to stop node1: stopping datanode localhost: stopping secondarynamenode 2.) netstat does not show anything listening on port 9000, Why? 3.) The webinterface of hadoop (on IP:50070 and :50030) is always running when I try to connect via my 'master' pc (also after stopping), Why? So, it obviously does not start correct, but I really don't know why... I have configured and double checked: the hosts file the ssh configuration the properties that I have set in core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml; slaves file has only node1 as entry the permissions of all the directories (I also don't use the tmp folder) Unfortunately I'm not able to install any new packages due to proxy permissions. jps does not work (I think the pre-installed java version does not support it !?) and the result of ps aux | grep java doesn't make a lot of sense for me. I would be happy about any idea why it maybe does not work, or any hint that I should try!
I need to debug pyCharm community version on Windows 7 and try to follow what their manual says: JStack This command line utility is provided with the JDK installation and can be found in JAVA_HOME\bin directory. Make sure to use the same or close JDK version to the one the IDE runs under (see Help | About). It will not work if IDE runs under 32-bit JDK and you run jstack from the 64-bit JDK distribution and vice versa. To use jstack you need the IDE process identifier (PID). PID can be obtained using jps utility that is located in the same directory as jstack. jps -mv My pyCharm: help/about reads: JRE 1.7.0_40 b43 x86 How ever, in C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin there is no jps and no jstack. I'm not used to the command line in Windows - perhaps I'm doing something wrong here? Am I supposed to look in a different directory? I could not find any system wide environmental variable JAVA_HOME what could give any clues here.

I googled this issue and all I got is that I need to set some system property which I already did (see above). Has anyone seen this to guide me through a workaround? In tracing the InVmSequenceManager it seems that the UUID is not in memory map so the logic is throwing the exception above. Maybe one solution would be to configure my own Sequence Manager however I am not sure how to do that. Thanks in advance,

My R.java gives an error public static final int 1405308882_more = 0x7f020000 Don't know or understand why its giving this error, i regenerate the R.java file and it still gives me the following above. and when i hover my mouse over it, it says underscore have to be located within digits I tried editing it but when it compiles it still regenerate the same name variable. Please before anyone starts rating this question as usless take your time to understand it I don't have error in any of my java files either in the src folder or layout folder every thing else is fine its just the R.java that generates that constant so please understand before you jump to conclusions. Thank you.
I wrote a context.io 2.0 java client for : accounts,discovery, threads and messages operations to be used in my project (based on the available ContextIO Java client). My code is at : https://github.com/dileepajayakody/isis-reputationbox/blob/master/reputationbox/dom/src/main/java/at/tomtasche/contextio/ContextIO_V20.java While testing it, when I invoke the accounts request: https://api.context.io/2.0/accounts and discovery requests (eg: https://api.context.io/2.0/discovery?email=testemail@gmail.com&source_type=IMAP, I successfully get the desired response with a HTTP 200 However when I invoke the messages, threads, contacts requests by adding the account_id parameter in the request URL (eg : https://api.context.io/2.0/accounts/1234ff425ad/messages) I get an empty JSON array with a HTTP 403 Forbidden response. When I try out the same request in the contextio developer console, I get the response without a problem. I don't think it's something wrong with the way I sign the oauth request since it's the same way I sign for accounts and discovery requests for which I get the contextIO response properly. Any help in resolving this error is much appreciated. Thanks, Dileepa
I'm trying to use VMware SDK 5.1 and it comes with Java code samples. It comes with a vim25.jar file which appears to be a jar file built by Apache Axis based on their vimService.wsdl file. I built an eclipse project with the sample classes, included the vim25.jar file in the project. When I run the sample and attempt to connect to the server, I get this error: Exception in thread "main" javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException: Cannot find 'vimService.wsdl' wsdl. Place the resource correctly in the classpath. I tried adding the vimService.wsdl file to the classpath by Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libaries and putting it there. I tried copying the wsdl file to the root of the eclipse project. I tried putting it in the root of the project/src folder. And I tried adding to the classpath via the Run > Run Configurations ... Classpath tab. Can't make the error go away. Can anyone help me understand why this error is happening, and how a jar file generated by Apache Axis and the associated wsdl is supposed to work? Thanks!
I have a spring batch project exported as a runable Jar file, it has 4 main methods, only one main is working, the other main needs referenced jar jai-codec-1.1.3.jar, but when I put the jar in the classpath, the first main also could not working and it gives error message "An unexpected error occurred while trying to open jar" here is my mainfest file: Manifest-Version: 1.0 Class-Path: JARS/spring-jdbc-3.1.1.RELEASE.jar JARS/spring-context-3.2.3.RELEASE.jar JARS/log4j-1.2.14.jar JARS/spring-tx-3.2.3.RELEASE.jar JARS/spring-core-3.2.3.RELEASE.jar JARS/spring-beans-3.2.3.RELEASE.jar JARS/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar JARS/spring-aop-3.2.3.RELEASE.jar JARS/aopalliance-1.0.jar JARS/spring-expression-3.2.3.RELEASE.jar JARS/commons-dbcp-1.4.jar JARS/commons-pool-1.5.4.jar JARS/ojdbc6-11.2.0.3.jar JARS/commons-lang3-3.0.jar JARS/itextpdf-5.5.1.jar JARS/jdom2-2.0.5.jar JARS/jai-codec-1.1.3.jar I found out that it is not because the specific jar file, it is because the length of the classpath is exceeded the limit, is there a way to put more jars in the MAINFEST file classpath? also I have defined all @autowired service and component classes but it still not working in jar, it only works when I defined those as bean in spring-config. Anyone can Help me to figure out why?
I'm debugging a JUnit test for code deployed on JBoss 7 AS via Arquillian. The debugger stops at breakpoints, but executes the old version of the code (e.g. it goes through empty lines) while I see the new version on my screen. I have found this question: I deleted my old remote debug configuration and created a new one, removed the default sources and attached the new ones (Source --> Add --> Java Project, and selected my projects). This didn't solve my problem. This answer suggest cleaning the projects. My projects are managed by maven, so I run mvn clean install from the console. This didn't help. Since the JBoss is started by Arquillian, I don't think it matters if I have the automatic publishing turned on (Window --> Preferences --> Server --> Launching), but it's turned on anyways. I'm having this issue quite often right now, at seemingly random moments - I run the same (working) remote debug configuration over and over and suddenly I'm experiencing this issue even though I haven't changed the sources in debug configuration. What is the cause of this issue? What is the quickest way to fix it?
I am finding that my tests are failing on my Jenkins server due to the program state being reused (as opposed to running each entry point in its own state). So in other words, one test has a side effect that causes another to fail. Two of my tests modify some static variable. One depends on it being the default. The fact that the other test changes the variable causes the test to fail. The manner of the tests are never meant to be run in the same program state (these test the program from entry point to exit). How can I make Maven run each test standalone? Possibly relevant information: Maven version 3.2.2 Failsafe version 2.6 Failsafe has execution goals are integration-test and verify Tests are just JUnit 4.11 tests Behavior confirmed on both Linux and OS X Using Java 1.8.0_05 Modules aren't being used. We're running the integration tests with clean integration-test (I realize now that it should have been clean verify, but that doesn't matter for this issue) I guess they're really more like system tests
I have been testing a Master / Worker cluster with the following set up: 2 virtual servers, each server has a Master and a Worker (separate jvms) Master is instantiated with ClusterSingletonManager The Masters are also the seed nodes. I was testing the fail over of the Masters by manually shutting down the "Active" Master node. In the scenario where the Workers are not processing tasks the fail over works fine. The "Non-active" Master node does detect the other node as unreachable and eventually will start it's Master actor. But if the workers are busy then fail over does not completely work. The "Non-active" Master node does detect the other as unreachable and quarantines as indicated in the below message but the node never starts the Master actor. 2014-07-23 23:52:31,777 INFO [JobRunner-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-17] Quarantined address [akka.tcp://JobRunner@12.3.201.135:40000] is still unreachable or has not been restarted. Keeping it quarantined. Anybody have any ideas why this is happening and if there is solution to this? Thanks. Regards.
I'm facing following Problem with Eclipse Debugger. I'm starting JBoss 5.1 in Debug-Mode directly from Eclipse (This process runs almost the whole day without restart) and sometimes when I want to start new Debug-Sesion with the Client Application (Swing + OSGi) or event debug some JUnit-Tests eclipse starts the process, but this new process is immediately suspended. When I change the Perspective to debug, I can see two process - JBoss is running without problems, but the new process is suspended - the Console output is clear, the process hat the Eclipse-Icon for suspended Threads. Sometimes it helps to select this process and to press the green "Resume" Button, sometimes I have to kill this process with "Terminate an Remove". When I try to run this process again I run sometimes in the same situation, sometimes runs the new process without problems. Really strange is, when eclipse "suspended" the new Client-App-process and I kill in Debug Perpective the JBoss process, the second, suspended process runs suddenly. I think, that these two process runs in some "deadlock" situation, but I don't know how to fix this. I don't have any Idea, what is the reason of this Problem... My Environment: Eclipse 4.3.2, Java 1.7.0_21-64bit

today I installed a windows movie maker 2012 on my windows 7. After this, my eclipse started to throw this: AL lib: (EE) DoReset: Failed to check format support: 0x80070057 Also I noticed that wmm 2012 came in some windows live essentials package, which as I investigated installed some directx components and windows update without even asking me about it(I set it to install only wmm 2012 in the windows live essentials package). Also, it looks like this "warning/exception?" doesnt harm, or I just didnt notice anything unusual in my application behaviour. I tried to uninstall everything that came with this package, tried to rebuild my project, tried to reinstall eclipse(Im using ADT bundle) and even used the windows recovery thing(which recovers the system to the latest recovery point) - nothing helped. So, it just pops up in eclipse console window when Im launching my desktop application. Color of this message is red. AL lib: (EE) DoReset: Failed to check format support: 0x80070057 Please, if anyone knows something about it - post here, this thing is just too annoying :( Thanks. EDIT I solved my problem! Good thing I had somewhere deep in my mind that 0x80070057 is related to sound! So after a bit of searching for the reason - I clicked on control panel -> sound, and it told me that there is something wrong with sound drivers and asked me If I want to fix it. So I accepted it, and woohoo this "warning/exception?" disappeared :D:D:D
After a server change, I get nasty SSL warning in browsers (tested FF & Chrome), when loading an applet, used in an JavaEE Application (Serlvet API 3) The warning says: "Certificate is not valid, and cannot used to identify the website" The more detailed warning says: "The certificate authority, who provided the certificate, is not trusted." The messages are translated into english, so please excuse slight differences there. After this message, I get the message of Java, which shows that the Applet is ordinary signed (the dialog with the blue sign). So the Applet is working, only the warning message annoys. Before I moved to another server, everything was fine and worked. No security warnings or anything else. The Applet is signed, by a certificate, which I requested from an CA. (rapidssl) The old server environment was just a common web space, offered by 3rd party hoster. Now I moved to my own server, which utilizes XEN for hosting VMs. On one of that internal vm's, our webserver is deployed. According to that, I defined firewall rules to route traffic http/https to the vms. Also the domain was ported, was purchased at old hoster, and the ip of new server is bound to domain. I use Tomcat 7 as Application Server on an debian based OS. In old environment, I could use the specified url in CN of my wildcard cert.(e.g. *.domain.com) In new environment the basic message says: *.domain.com:port is not a trusted site. I thought actually, that SSL Certs are independent of the used port. I've read that, on some research too. I also searched here in many threads, but the supposed answers didnt work for me. The certificate and root cert. are imported to Java's own keystore cacerts. In Tomcat 7, I use the JSSE Implementation for SSL, with properly setup keystore files. I've tried already this, but as im not that experienced with SSL/TLS Technology, the tried solutions maybe even wont solve my problem: Disabling SNI in Tomcat 7 (dont work) Adding Host aliases in server.xml (dont work) Can anyone clarify, what the actual problem is, or has experienced the same issue ? @edit: The are no error stacktraces in any logs, which I could provide here, also no exceptions gets thrown.

I wanted to add EclipseLink library to my project. For that I went to eclipse marketplace and installed eclipse link 2.5 kepler. My Eclipse IDE is luna, which comes after kepler. So, the error is probably due to difference in versions. Is there a way to be sure that this is the real reason and nothing else ? Please see the screenshot below. Edit: I just tried this - Click user libraries > expand eclipselink 2.5. It shows that libraries for eclipse link are missing (all red crosses). How can that be ? I installed eclipse link in eclipse and restarted it. Edit: I noticed the path on each of the errors is pointing to the older location of my workspace (I copied it to another folder and deleted the old workspace. Some files in the workspace still remain). I wonder how I will fix this.
I need to implement RPC over STOMP, where the client runs with javascript in a browser, and the server side is implemented using Spring messaging capabilities. While using @MessageMapping is fine for normal messaging, I find using @SendToUser quite limitating for implementing RPC because the client has an hard time to understand which reply is associated with which request in a scenario when multiple simultaneous requests are being made from the client. Of course there is no problem when just only one request is made, and the client waits for its reply, but problems arise when the client has to keep track of multiple "open" rpc calls. I've managed to make the system mostly fine by associating an ID with every request, i.e.: the client sends an id together with the message, and the server replies with a special message wrapper that contains this id, so the client is able to associate asynchronous replies with requests. This works fine but has several limitations: I have to develop code that needs to understand this structure, and that defies the uitlity to have simple annotated methods when the server side code generates an Exception the Spring @MessageExceptionHandler get called and the correct Exception is returned to the client, but the request id is lost because the handler has no (easy) way to access it. I know that with rabbitmq we can add "reply-to" header to every request that needs to be associated with a special reply (the rpc response), and this is implemented by creating a special temporary queue that the user is automatically subscribed to, but how may I use this scheme in Spring? Also, that would tie me a specific broker. How may I elegantly implement a correct RPC call in Spring that correctly handles server side exceptions? I find this a general problem and I think Spring could benefit greatly to implement it natively.

I am developing a small spring-boot-based command-line application. The main class has an @Autowired-annotated field @Autowired Repository repository; whose construction recipe is provided in Java Config class that has an appropriate @Bean-annotated method @Bean Repository repository(){...}. The @Bean-annotated method contains code that can throw checked and unchecked exceptions. @Bean Repository repository(){...//exceptions} My target is to create a user-friendly application which logs brief messages at appropriate logging level rather than long stack traces. Currently, an exception in Java Config @Bean-annotated method causes the application to exit with o.s.boot.SpringApplication: Application startup failed message and a very long stack trace. I wonder if there is a good way to handle at least typical exceptions (which I am aware of) in Java Config @Bean-annotated method to log user-friendly brief messages useful for troubleshooting. I assume such a strategy would expect adding exception handling code to Java Config class, but I have never seen such code in publicly available Java Config classes, which suggests exception handling code in Java Config classes could be a bad practice. Thank you.
I am currently working on a Java game for OSX (and possibly Windows in the future) - I decided to export a Pre-Alpha / Alpha test of the game - to see if the engine was working properly outside of Eclipse. When I tried to run the application it quit almost instantly, throwing the following errors (in Console): 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: [JavaAppLauncher Error] CallStaticVoidMethod() threw an exception 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: Exception in thread "main" 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: ten/plus/Game : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method) 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(ClassLoader.java:637) 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:621) 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:141) 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:283) 14-07-29 8:57:02.190 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.net.URLClassLoader.access$000(URLClassLoader.java:58) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:197) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:249) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at apple.launcher.LaunchRunner.loadMainMethod(LaunchRunner.java:56) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at apple.launcher.LaunchRunner.run(LaunchRunner.java:112) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at apple.launcher.LaunchRunner.callMain(LaunchRunner.java:51) 14-07-29 8:57:02.191 AM [0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus: at apple.launcher.JavaApplicationLauncher.launch(JavaApplicationLauncher.java:52) 14-07-29 8:57:02.220 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501: ([0x0-0x1c21c2].10Plus[3659]) Exited with code: 1 I know the code will throw a few IOExceptions - mainly due to image loading but it's all surrounded by try/catch and doesn't break the application when I remove the image files and run it in Eclipse. Some notes about the application: It runs in fullscreen at the native resolution of the device - in my case 1680 x 1050 - but it doesn't act like a normal fullscreen application. For example: In most fullscreen applications if you move your mouse to the top of the screen and wit a second or two the apple menu bar comes down (with the time, etc...) but not with this. I'm not sure if this has to be coded specifically but it's not a feature I really need. I use the thread but it is not called 'main' - which makes me wonder about: Exception in Thread "main" The application should run in 1.6+ as that's the version I chose when exporting from Eclipse. Finally I use both AWT and SWING. AWT for graphics, KeyListener etc... and SWING for window handling. Some notes about my computer software / hardware: I am running OSX 10.7.5 on a MacBook Pro 15 inch - early 2011 - as I said earlier my resolution is 1680x1050. According to Java Preferences I am running Java 8 Update 11, but according to Terminal I am running Java 6 Update 65 - both SE. (When I open Minecraft I get this towards the end of the launcher's boot [09:48:29 INFO]: System.getProperty('java.version') == '1.6.0_65') The last working export I have is my final export from Eclipse Kepler - I believe it's 1.4.3. That version had no IO whatsoever and ran in a 1200x875 window. This is my first export from Luna - 1.4.4 if I'm correct. I will try exporting the application in different versions of Java with both Kepler and Luna - in case the Luna exporter or Java version is the problem. Thanks in advance! PLEASE NOTE: I am beginner/intermediate in Java so please excuse me if I made some obvious mistake somewhere.
I am using oracle database 10g express edition. Recently I am facing ORA-12516 error frequently. It says -- "java.sql.SQLException: Listener refused the connection with the following error: ORA-12516, TNS:listener could not find available handler with matching protocol stack The Connection descriptor used by the client was: //127.0.0.1:1521/XE" As far as I am concerned this error is shown when user doesn't close variables like "Statement" "Resultset" and opens a lot of them. Every time I created any "Statement" or "ResultSet" type variables in a function I used this function -- http://paste.ubuntu.com/7902053/ to close those variables. I didn't close those variables in a final block of the function inside which those were declared. Instead I called this function (close_calls(..)) to close those variables and sent them as parameters inside the function close_calls(..). For example I called the function given above in no 17 and 23 line here -- http://paste.ubuntu.com/7902114/ But this error is still shown in the console. Is close_call(...) not working ? How can I get rid of this error ? I got the idea of closing those variables from here --- Closing Database Connections in Java

Hope you have some spare minutes for my question. For the last couple of days I was reading about Camel and managed to setup everything up and running. Now, I have bumped on a tricky part :). Basically, I define a route using Java in runtime and put the route configuration in DB. Routes are working and messages are flowing from one side to another. But, when an exception occurs I would like to know where the exception has occurred (between which route endpoints), store the current exchange body (in-flight message that is useful for further processing) in the DB, update the message by the user and then retry the route execution from the point of exception (where it failed). Lets say that all route steps are idempotent. My solution: Make a Interceptor for the route Granulate the route in as much as possible parts (each new step is a new route) Between each step update the DB with the current and future step and current exchange body If exception occurs, store the message in DB, update it using an editor Send a message to a next route point (taken from DB) using ProducerTemplate What do you think about this ? Is it doable or Camel cannot support me with this approach ? Thank you for patience and your time. Hope I was clear enough.
Reading through Eclipse debug topics I did not find an answer to my specific problem. I wonder if anybody else has seen it. I only experience this since switching to Luna, I used Kepler and Indigo before. I usually debug Tomcat, but it happens for any one-class test app. When the app hits the first breakpoint, Debug view is shown, then I have to wait 20-30 seconds for the debugger to initialize, and only then is the code line highlighted in the editor. From that point on every break is immediate. Other kind of slowness is not experienced. In Tomcat any subsequent request stops quickly. The problem is that it's restarted often when hot code replacement is not feasible. Anybody knows how to tweak it? There is no building or validating process going on at that time, and I tried to allocate various amounts of memory to Eclipse. -Xms256m, -Xmx2048m usually works very well for me.
I have a class called Handle, which essentially manages an embedded (graph) database for a server. High up in the enterprise bean framework, there is a bean which manages this object, and exposes web services which can be called by various users/beans etc. One of the things that this class does is validate submissions against a schema. There are a lot of possible checks. For example, if you want to create a graph in the database, it will validate your submission against the schema, and check that it is internally consistent, and do all these checks before it attempts to access the database. Now, this validation method is ostensibly a boolean function, but in practice it never returns false, it either returns true, or throws an exception which details exactly how it failed the validation. Now this seems like a classic case where you wouldn't usually throw an exception, because it is entirely predictable that some will fail the validation, in fact, its almost the point of doing validation. On the other hand, if you don't throw an exception, there is no way to inform the bean calling the function, and from there, the end user, exactly why his submission failed validation. He just gets "false" back. At the moment the bean handles the exceptions and depending which one is thrown returns a short message to the user explaining exactly how it failed. Is this a valid use of exceptions? Is there some other pattern that I should be using here? It all works fine, but it seems like it is violating the general principals of exceptions, which is that they should be rare and refer to unpredictable behaviour.
Did some research on this but can't find an answer for my set of circumstances. Problem: I can't start a debug on any Java apps in Eclipse Luna. The progress window tells me that it's "Launching Main" and the progress bar extends to 85% where it hangs. At this point I am given the following beneath the progress bar "Launching: Finding free socket..." Here's my setup: Eclipse Luna (clean install) Java is latest (1.7.0_65) Windows 7 pinging both localhost and 127.0.0.1 return good connections Debug worked fine with old Juno install Project runs fine, behaves properly and returns data, but can't be debugged. Not running Avast I am running Norton (no previous interference with debug) Any ideas would be appreciated. I've can't figure out what the heck is wrong with it. I'm sure it's some new variable that Eclipse added that I've never heard of that has to be set, but it sure is frustrating. Thanks guys.
I am having trouble running a java package I made by deploying my function in matlab. This is what I have tried and these are my errors. I deployed a jar file of my function from matlab. I tried to run it with the following steps: 1. change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81/runtime/glnxa64/:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81/bin/glnxa64/:opencv in the deployed project, my classes are in a folder called javafiles so I run it as: java -cp ../javafiles.jar:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81/toolbox/javabuilder/jar/javabuilder.jar:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81/bin/glnxa64/libmwMATLAB_imagesci_res.so:mex:opencv/. -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81/runtime/glnxa64/ javafiles.Class1 Here opencv and mex are folders in the current directory which contain some shared libraries and mex files required to run my project.

This is an infrastructure question. I have a Java web app that allows users to make 'transactions'. This transaction first calls a remote service and updates info there, and once it receives an ack from the remote service saying that the info has been successfully updated there, it will do some local computation and record the transaction in a local database. So my question is, what happens if the remote service records the change, but somehow my server fails to compute and record it in the local database? Say the power goes off right when the remote service completes but before the local update occurs. Then there is a mismatch between the remote and local data, and consistency is violated. How do I take care of this scenario? Also, is there any open source tools etc that can help me take care of this problem? For example let's say if the solution is to use a log-based rollback mechanism, I would hate to have to implement that all by myself. Thanks in advance for the help! :)
I am new to Android Development/Java Programming/Eclipse so please bear with me. I've been going through the Android Developer Training (developer.android.com/training) and the Hello Android book by Ed Burnette and keep running into a problem that is making it difficult to move forward. I'll do my best to describe it and am hoping that the community can help me resolve it. I began seeing this issue with the Android Developer Training (around Adding the Action Bar -> Adding Action Buttons) and it became impossible to circumvent at Hello Android's 3.3 Creating Opening Screen when I tried adding the Sudoku buttons. The only change I made when going through Hello Android was adding the Android Development Toolkit (ADT) for Eclipse. I don't recall this being a required download going through the Android Developer Training page so I am wondering if its addition could have contributed to the problem. The issue that I keep running into is that when I go to build the project, Eclipse keeps telling me: action_settings cannot be resolved or is not a field activity_sudoku cannot be resolved or is not a field container cannot be resolved or is not a field fragment_sudoku cannot be resolved or is not a field sudoku cannot be resolved or is not a field I've tried several fixes that I saw on in the forum including deleting the import.android.R from the sudoku.java file in my src folder but that brings up a bunch of errors that say R cannot be resolved into a variable. I've tried cleaning and rebuilding and restarting Eclipse, methods that occasionally worked before Hello Android and the plugin, but keep getting the same errors. I've also tried setting to Android 3.0 and higher thinking that might be an issue but there was no change. Occasionally I get another error regarding not being able to find the path for a container but I've been playing around with the IDE for 15 minutes and can't seem to get it to pop up again. I could really use some help on this. Hope to hear from you, Yusif Nurizade

"Error: Could not find or load main class Start" This is the error I have been dealing with for the past few days, no matter how much research I do it doesn't seem ot help me at all. I know that it is trying to locate "Start.java", I believe I have configured Eclipse to look for Start.java in the (default packages) package, where it is. However, I click the run button and the error just keeps popping up. Please, I desperately need help, any comment will be appreciated greatly. [Update] I managed to add Start.class to my classpath somehow, I just tried every single method on StackExchange and one of them seemed to work.

Our client is reporting when they try to start the app on their testing devices, the following error message appears: I searched for the error, found this and this and it's mentioned this is caused when the code sign process is faulty. From what I understand, if the code signing process fails, then the app shouldn't be able to run on any device, but the ones we have have no problem running the app at all. The app is built with BlackBerry SDK 6.0 and we have tested on both a BlackBerry 9360 with OS version 7.1 Bundle 2102 (v.7.1.0.746, Platform 9.6.0.112) and a BlackBerry 9800 with OS 6.0 Bundle 1907 (v6.0.0.448, Platform 6.4.0.210). Both devices can run the app. The client is testing on another BlackBerry 9360 but I don't have the OS specifications at the moment, but already requested them. I have installed the app through the BlackBerry Desktop Software, Eclipse's Debug As BlackBerry Device option and Eclipse's Load Project(s) on Device option. The client uses BlackBerry Desktop Software to install the app on their testing device. What can cause for the app to run fine on our devices but not on the ones the client uses? Is the problem related to the code signing keys? EDIT The client shared with us the following device information: BlackBerry 9900 7.1 bundle 1909 v7.1.0.658 platform 5.1.0.485 Are there any issues for this device with this specific or similar bundle setting? Also another strange thing the client reported when we were talking to them was that when they went to the route in Options -> Device -> Application Manager, when accesing the app details and then Edit Permissions, they reported although permissions were present, no modules for the app were shown, I double checked on my side and when I install the app from Eclipse (either through the Debug As... option or the Load Project(s) on Device option) the app shows the modules but when installed through the BlackBerry Desktop Software the modules appear hidden, in both cases I can run the app on both devices we own. Is this normal? Can this affect certain devices and make them not run the app? EDIT 2 I ran the signature tool by executing the jar and it shows the code signing process to be completed with no failed required or failed optional signatures. I attach the image displaying this:
Hi I am trying to learn how to write an android app in Eclipse Juno with the latest Android SDK and tools all for 64bit windows 7, in case that makes any difference. I had previously got through the tutorials at https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/starting-activity.html#ReceiveIntent All was working fine until i got to the lesson 'Setting up the Action Bar' where it asked whether the app should support Android 3.0 and above only or 2.1 and above. I chose 2.1 and above and followed those instructions to include the support libraries for compatibility. After I did that and set up the java build path, I am now getting many errors in the basic app that state 'R cannot be resolved to a variable'. I have searched quite extensively and tried many previous solutions but no luck. I am thinking there may be a conflict as I have my previous app (before adding the action bar) also in the package in eclipse. Should I remove it and try to rebuild with just the new one, and the compatibility folders? Any new ideas that I can try are welcome. I can post any code that might help - it is just basic tutorial stuff. Cheers, LRW
I have a spring boot application. I use IntelliJ 13. I want to launch my application in debug mode and debug it. I'm on Windows and I'd like to use shared memory. I would like to just be able to click the debug icon, or a single maven goal, and the application launches in debug mode and the IDE attaches the debugger. This is how I am used to debugging most of my java apps. However, mixing spring-boot and IntelliJ seems to complicate things. IntelliJ seems to want to connect to the wrong process when I push the green "debug" button and I can't find a way to change the shared memory address that the green 'debug' button's functionality is determined to connect to. The closest I've come is to add jvmoptions to the maven goal in pom.xml, and then if I add a Remote run configuration, IntelliJ lets me specify a shared memory address that matches what I wrote in the pom. This requires multiple clicks to launch the application and then debug it. It works, in a similar way that using notepad.exe to write code also works. Hence my question. Is there a 1-step solution using shared memory? Variation of this question: Debugging jsp with spring-boot and IntelliJ However the question and answers are limited to using sockets.
I have a big trouble on Eclipse I download the latest ADT bundle, then new a new Android project but an error occurred : then i google it and found some suggestions, such as new workspace, but still not work and i found a strange phenomenon, java compiler always changed to 1.4, and jre always missing, it occurred every time when the workspace changed the new project is weird too i choose property of the project, another error occurred when selected Android Then i google the error, found a solution is create a file named default.properties, put it in the root of project, and it worked, but i still can not create layout file or editing string.xml file What's wrong with my Eclipse?
I have a service that allow users to add dynamic content to a repository. So basically I have a generic Document class that contains a list of property for that specific object depending on what type of document the user is adding (eg. an invoice document has an invoice number property while a wiki document has an author property, and so on). The service is comprised of different layers and at some point I have a class that has to check if the document to be added is compliant to the rules configurer, evaluating if all required properties are provided, if they are all of the right type, etc. If any of these validations fail I want to throw a custom exception which contains the validation status. The question is: should my ValidationException be checked or unchecked? I read a lot of best practice on how to decide what kind of exception use. I was thinking about using RuntimeException but in this case the exception is not caused by error in coding or stuff like that but just by the user input... On the other hand using a checked exception would mean to propagate the "throws" syntax in all the above layer of the application and probably in the 90% of the service's methods making the code much less readable and manteinable.
Further to Java: what information in error stack trace do we typically not wish to show users? and How to manipulate SqlException message into user friendly message (C#) I can either duplicate each of my SQL table constraints in my Java code (e.g. explicitly run an SQL statement to check if a row being added has a primary key that already exists). Or I can try to catch SQLExceptions in a common class/method that converts the exception into a message that makes sense to an end user. The first seems like a lot of work. It also seems like unnecessary duplication. I still need the second approach as well in case some constraint gets overlooked or added without corresponding Java code. Or because there can be other types of SQLException (e.g. if the Ethernet lead falls out) The trouble with the latter is that the exceptions are hard to parse. SQLException.getCause().getMessage() produces something like The statement was aborted because it would have caused a duplicate key value in a unique or primary key constraint or unique index identified by 'CURRENCY_PK' defined on 'CURRENCY'. Obviously I'd prefer to have a message more like Sorry, that currency code has already been defined, please edit the existing currency instead or use a different currency code for the currency you are adding. I imagine the .getMessage() text is likely to depend on the run-time environment and user language and other things. I don't see a way to get, for example, a numeric code that I could use to lookup my own user-friendly message. Q: Is there a way to produce user-friendly messages in Java from SQLExceptions?
I met a problem after I restarted my SonarQube server on my localhost:9000 last night, when I hit "StartSonar.bat" command, the error message showed as below. Error message: Unable to bind listener to any port in the range 32000-32999. An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.<0x271d> I use JDK 1.7.0_60 and my sonar server is 4.3.2 run in Windows 7 64-bit. I did some investigations on the web, the problem might occur because the port is used. I added wrapper.port.min=32000 wrapper.port.max=32999 in my C:/[SonarQube server location]/conf/wrapper.conf but it still doesn't work. I don't know why it happened last night, because I could start my server well before yesterday and used it for several weeks without problems. The only reason I thought is, I did install my jre version from 7 to 8 and same with my jdk version in the past two days. But after I found this sonar error, I uninstalled them and changed my wrapper.java.command to absolute path to where jdk 1.7 version is, and confirmed it by hitting java -version on my console. Thus, my local sonar server now using jdk 1.7 for sure. However, after solving that Java version problems, ,this Java Wrapper Service problems still keep showing up, I have no idea about this. Anyone has the similar issues could share how you fix it? Any helps are greatly appreciated! Thanks!!
I know that this question has been asked countless times, but I have no idea what I'm doing, and need some help. Just... help me This is what I get when I run eclipse: Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\client\jvm.dll".

None of the other solutions I've tried have worked for me. Thanks in advance!
At my institution we have a script that has been encrypting and decrypting passwords for about 10 years from a database (please, let's not get into the best-practices of doing that or not; it's a healthy debate in my own community but the business requires it). It's been doing that running on Java 1.3 using BouncyCastle. So, essentially, I have a very old keystore with very old passwords, and I need to use those but in an updated codebase running on an upgraded machine with new Java. We decided to rewrite the codebase surrounding that functionality, which basically requires rewriting this piece as well. Basically, though, the encryption part of the code is identical. Now we are deploying it to Java 1.7 on Redhat. This is where we ran into problems. My development machine: OSX, Java 1.7 (build 8) My test machine: Redhat, Java 1.7 (build 9) The new code executes just fine on my local development machine. But when I tried to deploy it to our test machine I got "UnrecoverableKeyException: no match". So on our test machine I tried to deploy it using Java 1.6 -- and lo and behold, that works fine. I then acquired Java 1.7 build 8 (thinking build 9 was the issue) and tried that, but same error as on build 9. So it would seem that BouncyCastle: on an OSX machine it will run on Java 1.7 on a Redhat machine it won't run on Java 1.7 but does run on Java 1.6 and below. My question is this: does anyone know if there is in fact a problem with Java 1.7 and BouncyCastle? I tried looking through the BC website but aside from stating that the latest BC jars are compatible with Java 1.7, the rest of the site seems pretty broken (lot's of 404s). I tried googling, but almost everything related to this exception is referencing Android and seems unrelated. Or is there something I'm missing about getting it to run on Java 1.7? I'm certainly not well-versed in BC, PGP, or anything related to encryption and am mostly winging it to be honest. LOL More detail: I am using the bcpg-jdk15on-151.jar which BC states is compatible for JDK 1.5-1.7 By "deploy" I mean I am installing into Apache Karaf 3.

I'm experimenting Apache Nutch 1.7 and Solr on Ubuntu 14.04 x64 (AMD) LTS and when i try to run Nutch, it gives me this error message: Error: JAVA_HOME is not set. But when i type echo $JAVA_HOME command on terminal, it gives me this path: /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64 Below you can see what i've done step by step. How can i fix this? *ps: Ubuntu is a virtual machine which runs on Mac with Oracle VirtualBox Intalling java on terminal with sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-7-jdk Checking java installation by java -version command Setting JAVA_HOME with: sudo nano /etc/environment Then typing following line at the bottom of file: JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64" kntrl+X shortcut for Saving changes. Then this command: source /etc/environment Now JAVA_HOME must be set. I checked it by following command and it gives me the path. echo $JAVA_HOME and output is same as above. Then i installed Solr by sudo apt-get -y install solr-tomcat I controlled installation by typing this address in a browser: http://localhost:8080/solr and it shows me initial page of solr I downloaded Apache Nutch 1.7 from http://nutch.apache.org and file was named as apache-nutch-1.7.-bin.tar.gz Then extract it: tar -zxvf apache-nutch-1.7-bin.tar.gz I verfied Nutch's installation by simply this: cd apache-nutch-1.7 then bin/nutch And the output is like Usage: nutch COMMAND where...... Then i edit my conf/nutch-site.xml file as in here: Link (You need to look under this title: "3) Set Up Your Nutch-Site.Xml" ) Things i did different from that last reference are; MyBot and MyBot,* fields. Instead of MyBot i wrote mySpider Then i get in conf directory of nutch with Terminal. Here's what i did after: mkdir -p urls , cd urls , touch seed.txt , nano seed.txt i only wrote this url in the file as it's suggested in official tutorial of nutch: http://nutch.apache.org 17After i saved my changed in seed.txt file. I edit the conf/regex-urlfilter.txt file. I delete these two lines: accept anything else +. Then i wrote this instead of them: +^http://([a-z0-9]*\.)*nutch.apache.org/ After that, I used this command as it's suggested in tutorial: bin/nutch crawl urls -dir crawl -depth 3 -topN 5 After this command i see this error message: Error: JAVA_HOME is not set. I also found this article but it didn't solve my problem either: Nutch - Getting Error: JAVA_HOME is not set. when trying to crawl
I am working with an example application, attempting to study the debugging tools in Struts 2. I have done the following: put <s:head /> within my <head> tags put struts2-dojo-plugin in my maven dependencies put "?debug=browser" at the end of the link being invoked When I click on the link that has the "?debug=browser" at the end, it displays the debug page, with a number of links labelled "Expand". I am not getting any errors at this point in the console. When I hover over the "Expand" links, they show "javascript://nop/"; when I click on them, I can't see that anything happens. I tried a number of different ones. When I look at the source for the page, I can see that there is javascript to execute when the execute link is clicked. I attempted to enter the Chrome debugger, but I don't know how to open the source so that I can set a breakpoint. So, does someone know something else to do that a newbie might forget? Or can someone please point me to some kind of troubleshooting method?
vFabric tc server fails to load my JNI libraries when starting a Spring bean that executes 'System.loadLibrary("...")'. Indeed, I need to execute some JNI shared library from my Spring beans deployed in vFabric tcServer edition (STS) Spring Tools Suite. Although I followed the advice in "Customizing the environment or JVM options for vFabric tc Server (2030216)" the error kept poping out: "nested exception is org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException: Could not instantiate bean class [my.JniServiceFactory]: Constructor threw exception; nested exception is java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no myJNIsharedLib in java.library.path" I further discovered error in wrapper.log file in the tc server instance .../bin/winx86_64 directory telling: Unable to open configuration file. C:\java\SpringTools\vfabric-tc-server-developer-2.9.6.RELEASE\base-instance\bin\winx86_64\wrapper.conf and also found errors when executing the wrapper at command line: wrapper -q ..\..\conf\wrapper.conf, yielding wrapper | OpenSCManager failed - Access is denied. (0x5), which suggested a UAC issue. So I elevated my windows account to Administrator and even turned off UAC... which solved the wrapper.exe error but did not solve the UnsatisfiedLinkError when starting my app in tc server. I also discovered a 'setenv.bat' file under the tc server instance directories containing the line 'set JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH=' that invites you to define it, but no effect. I also tried setting a global environment variable JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH under my system properties, hence available when starting Spring Tools and then the tc server... no way.
I'm building an app using JavaFX 8 and whenever I run it, I get a wall of text warning me that a looked up value for the -fx-cursor rule of all text input controls could not be resolved: Aug 17, 2014 10:16:26 PM javafx.scene.CssStyleHelper calculateValue WARNING: Could not resolve 'a lookup value' while resolving lookups for '-fx-cursor' from rule '*.text-area *.content' in stylesheet jar:file:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar!/com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.bss I received a similar warning for the *.text-input style class and attempted to manually specify the rule in my CSS file, but that did not remove the warning, as shown below: Aug 17, 2014 10:16:26 PM javafx.scene.CssStyleHelper calculateValue WARNING: Could not resolve 'a lookup value' while resolving lookups for '-fx-cursor' from rule '*.text-input' in stylesheet file:/Users/orionf22/NetBeansProjects/MyApp/target/classes/styles/myapp.css I saw similar questions online that said it could have something to do with the default CSS file not being loaded prior to some component looking up the value, but the recommended solutions for such questions did not work for me. I have tried explicitly declaring both Caspian and Modena as the stylesheet for the application via setUserAgentStylesheet() but that also has not worked.
Having a problem with Eclipse (Luna) IDE, while running the program I encountered a never ending loop so had to terminate the program. After which every-time I try to re-run the program it just hangs when loading the Debug Configuration. I am trying to create a Eclipse Plug-in to retrieve a file name and add comments to it. I don't believe there's an error with the program as it was working fine before. I have tested a simple helloWorld program in another workspace to see if there were any problems but that program works fine. From what I have read it could be something to do with the metadata file but I have no idea how to correct it. Problem When attempting to load the Eclipse Luna box pops up (this is normal) in the bottom right-hand corner of the box, it shows what it is loading. It seems to hang at the point when it is trying to load org.eclipse.web.core. The program was working fine up before the loop happened and I could run it without any problems. When Eclipse stops responding it asks "if you wish to close the program" and below that it offers you some problem details which are listed below. Problem Details Problem signature: Problem Event Name: AppHangB1 Application Name: javaw.exe Application Version: 8.0.11.12 Application Timestamp: 539f94f3 Hang Signature: 8701 Hang Type: 134217728 OS Version: 6.3.9600.2.0.0.256.48 Locale ID: 2057 Additional Hang Signature 1: 8701579a6fb10e5d0065e1f36c8dcf91 Additional Hang Signature 2: 6c5e Additional Hang Signature 3: 6c5ef7fd43455b1ace2cb9fa4a881a13 Additional Hang Signature 4: 8701 Additional Hang Signature 5: 8701579a6fb10e5d0065e1f36c8dcf91 Additional Hang Signature 6: 6c5e Additional Hang Signature 7: 6c5ef7fd43455b1ace2cb9fa4a881a13 Have Tried Cleaning and rebuilding all projects, disabling firewalls and antiviruses, creating another basic program, reinstalling Eclipse and Java.
I'm diagnosing a customer issue that crops up very occasionally: ClassNotFoundExceptions for classes compiled from JSPs. Most of the time everything works fine, but every so often (maybe once every couple of weeks across a dozen-ish nodes) Tomcat can't load the class file for a particular JSP (generally just one page, seemingly at random). The class file exists in the 'work' directory. It doesn't appear to be corrupt. I can remove it and the corresponding .java file, and it will be recreated (identically) on the next request - but Tomcat continues to report the ClassNotFoundException. Restarting Tomcat fixes the problem. Platform details: RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 Tomcat 6.0.24-72 (official 'tomcat6' package installed with yum) OpenJDK Java 1.6.0_32 I have been digging through source code for the Jasper JSP compiler and the JVM classloader code that it uses to load these classes (org.apache.jasper.servlet.JasperLoader based on a java.net.URLClassLoader). If I'm reading the code correctly, each JSP page gets a corresponding 'context' object (JspCompilationContext/JspServletWrapper) created when a particular JSP is first accessed. The JspCompilationContext contains the JasperLoader associated with the page. My best theory is that something within the classloader is caching a reference to, e.g., a filesystem inode that becomes invalid (e.g., due to a filesystem maintenance activity). However, I can't see anything in the classloader code that would be doing that, and it looks like a new classloader should be created if the JSP is recompiled, and such recompilation doesn't fix the issue. So, my best theory is not good. Unfortunately this has only been seen at a customer site, and is not reproducible at will, so my ability to debug directly is limited. As such, I'm looking for any good possibilities to investigate.
Can you suggest a method of identifying the source of a rendering error from a debugger? Misko Hevery classifies bugs into three categories: Logical Wiring Rendering Its clear to me that my problem is a rendering bug. I have a Swing application with a Panel that contains multiple layers. Rendering all the layers can take a significant amount of time so the application uses a thread pool to render layers and tiles from layers into BufferedImages. When it comes time for the Event Dispatch Thread to render the panel the most-recently rendered BufferedImages are drawn to the screen. This setup has performed adequately. A new feature requires that a certain layer type support transparency. Something, somewhere isn't preserving the transparency. The error could be in a number of places, possibly in the implementation of the objects to be rendered, the error could possibly be in the offline rendering thread implementation. Its possible that the many BufferedImages aren't combined together correctly in the EDT rendering code. I'm not asking anyone to look at the code and tell me where the error is. What I want to know is what techniques people have found particularly effective in troubleshooting a Graphics2D rendering issue. I'm a big supporter of unit tests but I'd prefer to start with another technique. Is there a method or trick to visually inspect a BufferedImage or Graphics2D object from the debugger? In the Netbeans Variables and Watches windows Netbeans sometimes uses PropertyEditors to display variable values. In this example image the value of foregroundColor and backgroundColor are shown as small swatches of the Color's value. Is there an easy way to add/enable a Netbeans PropertyEditor which would display the contents of a BufferedImage? I could temporarily sprinkle the code with method calls to write the various BufferedImages encountered to the disk such that they could then be inspected offline. It might work but it would be tediious to match the file on disk to the source code. What would you do?
I am fairly new to android, java and eclipse here. When my code run into some exception, the program crashes and I got a big chunk of error information in the logcat. The logcat shows really too much information. I have to scroll all the way to the top to see where exactly the exception was original caused. That gives me a headache every time. Is there any option I can set to reduce the amount of useless information in the logcat? And, there is one more annoying thing. When the program first stopped running, I don't see anything in the log cat. I have to click the "Resume" button twice in order to see the large chunk of information in log cat. The second problem is that when the program breaks, the stack trace I got doesn't contain the original point where the exception was thrown. It looks the exception was thrown and caught by the outer level code in android system. That stack trace is completely useless and I can't use it to inspect the local variables within the function causing the original exception. I read some posts regarding setting breakpoints in specific exceptions. That works if I know what is the original type of exception. But the truth is, after the original exception was caught by the outer level system code, all I can see in the debugger is a "runtimeException". Thanks for any tips to help the debugging in eclipse more efficient.

I have recently started to learn about Red5 server. I am following this tutorial to develop a simple video chat app: http://tharas.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/chat-application-with-red5-and-flex/. I am able to create the flex client. For the service side, I have created a Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse. Then manually copied the WEB-INF folder files and the Application.java file from the source code zip given in the above tutorial page at the bottom. After that when I am trying to start the Red5 server, it is failing with the error: Caused by: java.rmi.server.ExportException: internal error: ObjID already in use. I searched many forums for hours to resolve this. What I could figure out is, it is possible that the server start up script is trying to create RMI registry entry in the JVM twice, which is not allowed. One forum suggested editing the /etc/hosts file. One forum suggested commenting out the rmiregistry creation in red5.properties and delete the JMX part in red5-common.xml. But nothing worked! I have installed Red5 version 1.0 in Windows 8. I have installed the Red5 Eclipse plugin and running the server from within Eclipse. Any help is appreciated. If you need, I can post the detailed server log.
So I got an error, string or binary data would be truncated error from sql-server. I am using hibernate to persist data to MS sql-server. Usually when you get an error like this it means that the column you're trying to save to is not big enough to hold the data you are trying to insert. I carefully started to compare to see if one of my BigDecimal variables in the domain doesn't have the correct precision, but after spending a lot of time, I realized this was not the case. Turns out, I was missing @ManyToOne(optional = false) in the child domain. My parent domain object has a one to many relationship with the child. Adding the annotation solved the issue for me. And I am Hoping this will help somebody seeing similar error. The question is: Why is database giving a data truncation error when ManyToOne annotation is missing in the domain?
I'm currently in the process of learning more about Java. I downloaded a sample program that has about 5 different .java files in the source folder. Whenever I try to execute the class files in the command prompt using "java ClassNameHere", I get a message in the cmd prompt that says "Error: Could not find or load main class ClassNameHere". I've tried recompiling them using the javac command and they compiles without any issues. Its just the class file i'm having trouble with. In addition to this, I also cannot run the java files using Eclipse. Instead of getting an option to "Run as Java Application", "non applicable" appears under the "Run as" tab in Eclipse. I've tried a number of different solutions already posted online, including another command that uses "java -cp . ClassNameHere" or something along those lines and they have not worked for me. Any help is appreciated. Edit Link to program from my drive since I'm not home https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9_pcTVZTnfEeVdzZmM0ZmFkTmc/edit?usp=docslist_api

I doubt such a thing is possible, but without attaching a debugger to a java application, is it possible to have some collection populated with information about every exception that is generated in a java application, regardless of if it is caught or not? I know that in .NET, messages get generated by the application about exceptions which at that point are called "First Chance Exceptions", which may or may not subsequently be handled by the application. I'm wondering if there might be a similar mechanism in java I can exploit to view information about all the exceptions generated at runtime. Just to clarify. This has nothing to do with the context in which an exception occurs. This question is not about what I do in a catch block, or unhandled exceptions. Its about knowing if the JVM provides a mechanism to see every exception generated at runtime, regardless of what generated it, or the context.
We are customizing the site generation in maven and one of the things that it does is call Visio to have it translate some charts into png. We use a vbs script which calls Visio and that is called from a java class by calling Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command); where command is cmd /c "cd "C:\Path\To\Module\site\target\staging"&&exportVisioSvg.vbs "C:\Path\To\inFile.vsd" "C:\Path\To\outFile.png"" Now this code executes on my own machine just fine. Visio is called up and generates a file. When I run it on the server hosting our Jenkins instance it works as well. When I run the command by itself it works just fine. Finally when I goto the Jenkins\workspace and execute the maven build there it works just fine. However when I run the build in jenkins with exactly the same command (I copied and pasted it) it does not generate the Visio charts. Everything else runs fine and there is no stack trace outside of our own thrown error that goes off when the image is not where it is supposed to be. The exit code from the process is 0 as well and there is no output to either stdout or stderr (the windows equivalent) generated by the process and it has to complete or the exit code would be -1. Timeout isn't a problem as it has 50000 ms to run but always returns within a sec or less (you can see the error get thrown right after the call to the script). I switched Jenkins to run under the admin account where everything is installed (moving it from SYSTEM) so it should have access to the PATH. I have no idea what to do at this point.
Apologies if this has been discussed on other threads but I find it helps clarify my thinking when I am forced to write down my questions. I am trying to properly understand the concept of checked vs unchecked exceptions and exception translation in Java but I am getting confused. So far I understood that checked exceptions are exceptions that need to be always caught in a try/catch block otherwise I get a compile time error. This is to force programmers to think about abnormal situations that might happen at run time (like disk full etc). Is this right? What I did not get was why we have unchecked exceptions, when are they useful? Is it only during development time to debug code that might access an illegal array index etc? This confusion is because I see that Error exceptions are also unchecked as is RunTimeException but its not clear to me why they are both lumped together into an unchecked category? EDIT: Ok, I think I can boil down my question to be more specific after thinking about it more. If a Java method throws a checked exception and it makes more sense to handle it two layers above, should I just keep rethrowing the same checked exception in every layer (i.e bubbling up) till it gets to the layer where it can be handled? Or alternatively I can throw a more specific (unchecked perhaps) exception that the layer above me can interpret more meaningfully?
I run my unit tests from the command line, invoking org.junit.runner.JUnitCore, and I find the way JUnit vomits assertion failures in my face with 35 lines of stack trace of which only 1 is relevant to me quite annoying. I’ve been playing around with the Spock Framework recently, and I find its output beautiful. However, its documentation seems to be lacking and the whole framework seems to be too much magic, so for now I prefer to stick with simpler, more well-known tools. So my question is if there’s a way to get JUnit display more to the point output without the irrelevant stack frames, at least in the case of assertion errors. Getting the detailed descriptions of assertions and concise exception reports of Spock would be nice, though. I use the command line, so IDEs are off the table, but I’m willing to trade JUnit for other solutions as long as they are simple, elegant and have good support.
I am trying to compile and run some java files I have made in Eclipse. The full path to the .java file is C:\Users\MYNAME\Documents\Java\Introduction\src\tests\Test.java. tests is the package I created in Eclipse and src is a folder that Eclipse made under Introduction (which is the project name). In my environment variables, I have the following relevant variable: JAVA_HOME C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_40\bin Under system variables I have the following: CLASSPATH %JAVA_HOME% I go to my cmd and cd into the tests directory (cd C:\Users\MYNAME\Documents\Java\Introduction\src\tests). Then I compile using javac Test.java. This seems to work as I then have a Test.class file under the same directory. Now I want to run the file, I type java Test and I get the error, "could not find or load main class". I've tried a variety of things including appending .class and .java to the end but I keep getting the error. I looked at some answers and docs and I managed to get it to work if I cd into: cd C:\Users\MYNAME\Documents\Java\Introduction\src (i.e, get out of the package) and then run: java -cp . tests.Test So that seems to temporarily set the class path to the current directory, and run Test from the package tests. However, I want to simply be able to type java Test. I know it's possible as I used to be able to do it, but now for some reason I cannot (I must have changed something along the way...). Any help is appreciated.
I am creating a Java program using JNI to gather data via a C program. I have gone through this JNI tutorial (https://thenewcircle.com/static/bookshelf/java_fundamentals_tutorial/_java_native_interface_jni.html), and everything compiles correctly. However, when I try to run the Java program in Eclipse, I keep getting this error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no TurtleTrackerImpl in java.library.path at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source) at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(Unknown Source) at main.TurtleTracker.(TurtleTracker.java:28) at main.Driver.main(Driver.java:54) I include the library using System.loadLibrary("TurtleTrackerImpl") in the Java class of the same name. I have printed out the library path to make sure it is correct (C:\Users\duril_000\workspace\ArenaTracker\ArenaTracker\src), and I have checked for the existence of the libTurtleTrackerImpl.jnilib within that path (it exists and I can even print out its contents within Eclipse). There are a lot of other similar issues online, but I have not been able to find any where the library path was correct and the issue persisted. Please assist--I cannot think of what would be wrong? Let me know if more info is needed.

I am tryng to draw lines in a program and I constantly get this error.. What I am doing is the following: I have a JFrame with a BoxLayout(in the Y_AXIS), and inside this frame I have 6 JPanel one below the other. In the first 2 panels I have some JLabels and JTextFields, and I would like to draw the lines in the third JPanel and I did this: public void Dibujar(int vidas){ Graphics graf = panel3.getGraphics(); if(vidas == 6){ graf.drawOval(10, 10, 30, 30); } else{ graf.drawOval(10, 10, 60, 60); } } But doing this I get the NullPointerException, instead of this I tried using the method paintComponent that it works but it draws below all the Jpanels and not exactly the Jpanel3. If you need to explain something else just tell me. Thank you very much in advance.
I would like to ask for your help to solve the following problem I am developing software with Java SE and to use Java-Image Scaling library that is in url: https://code.google.com/p/java-image-scaling/ I'm resize a photo that will be for 6400x4800 with 47 MB. If I run the program within the Netbeans resizing is performed successfully. If I run the JAR starting DOS resizing successfully also occurs. If I run the JAR File Explorer in Windows the image is not resized and the program is stopped eternity. Does not generate any exception The problem is in the line of code (When .JAR runs on Windows): BufferedImage rescaled = resampleOp.filter(src, null); I think the Windows lock resizing because the image size is too large or too heavy or take a long time to run this resizing. If the image resized was smaller the Windows error did not occur. I did this test How can I resolve this problem in Windows? Is there any solution for this? Thanks a lot

I'm working on a legacy system that has a custom exception that's used gosh-frickity-everywhere. It was inspired by the ServletException class, that said "well any time you have an exception in your Servlet, you'll want to throw this ServletException". As the system evolved (over 10 years) a more robust system of catching the exceptions at a higher level has taken place and it's no longer necessary to wrap every exception in this custom exception. (One could argue it never was, but that's another story. It's a stable app, so I tend not to complain too much!!) But we're not going to be refactoring them all at once, just slowly over time. However, one thing that would make things simpler going forward would be if the custom exception were a runtime exception instead of a checked exception. This way we wouldn't need to explicitly catch it everywhere, and legacy code that hasn't been refactored yet will just continue to throw this the same way as they'd throw a null pointer exception if one occurred. My question is... What are the side effects of taking a once checked exception and making it a runtime exception? I can't think of any, aside from warnings for unnecessary check and throws declarations, but it would be nice to get input from someone who has been down this road before.
I am working on a Netbeans Platform module (jMonkeyEngine plugin to be precise) in which I have used a JavaFX to build the UI a JFXPanel in the TopComponent displays the Javafx content. I have created a new Netbeans FileType and the JavaFX UI is used to modify the contents of the DataObject associated with the FileType. Recently my application has started crashing due to Out Of Memory : Permgen Space error and I cannot pinpoint the exact code causing it primarily as the stack trace points to a different thread and line of code each time this happens. I tried increasing my PermGen space to 1 gb using the -XX:MaxPermSize=1g command line switch but it did not fix the issue. So, I profiled my application using Netbeans Profiler to find any memory leaks but I am completely new to analysing the profiler output/heap dumps. As mentioned, each time the error occurs, the stack trace and heap dumps point to a different thread and a different line of code (sometimes the one's I wrote for the plugin and other times those provided via Netbeans Platform API's). The only thing common in all the heap dump analysis is that there is a sudden increase in the difference between the heap size and used heap space in the VM Telemetry graphs and the 'Time Spent in GC' immediately rises to 100% from being 0-3%. Here are some screenshots : screenshot 1, screenshot 2 You can also see that heap size(red region in the leftmost telemetry graph ) rises to max value specified in the -XX:MaxPermSize when the application crashes. Does this mean that there is a memory leak in the application?? If so, how can I detect it as the source of the error is different each time it occurs?? Here are the command line switched I am using : -J-Xms32m -J-Xmx256m -J-XX:PermSize=512m -J-XX:MaxPermSize=1g -J-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=2048m.
This question could be thought of as just the Java version of this c++ question: Unit test compile-time error I'm writing some utility classes that mess with generics in java and things have gotten weird enough that I find myself wishing I knew how to write a unit test for code that is supposed to cause a compiler error. I know how to make a unit test pass only when the expected exception is thrown. No idea how to make it pass only when I get the expected error. Is this possible? If so, how? Is there a typical way of doing this? Is there a jUnit way? An example would be using a method (lets say, one that performs a cast) in a way that should cause an error. I'd like a test that would only pass when the code calling that method produces an error. I'd run it along with other tests that should not cause an error. As another example read Generic And Parameterized Types and note how the comments often say things like "fails with ClassClassException" "should fail, but succeeds". Those seem like tests that could be automated. This is not to test the compiler. It's to test that the generic code I wrote does what it should do. My gut tells me this goes beyond what the compiler or libraries could do and is into the realm of IDE magic, strange project configuration, or static code analysis. I really have no idea. I just want to be just as sure that the code causes the errors it should as I am that it's not causing the errors it shouldn't. I use eclipse, ant, and jUnit so an answer that details how this could be done with them would be perfect.

I am deploying a Java EE project in a server that uses the MCR of Matlab for some image processing functions. I've been trying this for months I can't make it work. The problem is when it is going to uses the MCR it cannot find the .so libraries.

So I have been using the ExpectedException to expect a thrown exception's types, messages, causes and even matchers. But why isn't there a utility method to simply expect an exception object completely? Surely, I'd better off testing object equality (assuming I know what I'm doing) rather than testing all its individual attributes? After all, if a method A merely throws up any exceptions that its delegator method B throws (method A calls method B), it would be much easier for me to mock method B to throw an exception, say Exception A and check for the exact object being thrown in my method A's test method? So why isn't such a utility method provided? Of course I can wrap my method A call in my test and catch the exception to test the object, but the same can be said of types, messages and causes too - I'd imagine the objective is to make the test code look a lot more readable that it is w/o the try/catch block.

We are using Weblogic version 10 for our java application and we are using Connection Pooling in our code. We are getting few errors on the logs like: Connection has been administratively disabled for multiple times. It happens randomly and not on a regular basis. In some cases, we are getting an error like: Connection has been administratively destroyed and whatever application process is running will be stopped. We analyzed the code repository using PMD plugin to see if we have any connections that are not closed and didn't find anything that was related to the process that ran on the days which we faced the issue. Also I have checked the weblogic admin console to see the number of max. connections it have created. It was around 20 only whereas the connection pool was having a min. and max. value of 100. So we got the error of connection has been administratively disabled even though the admin console showed the max no: of active connections that was made were 20. It will be really helpful if anyone could suggest why we are receiving this error and how we can prevent this. Also why am I seeing the count as 20 in admin console but still getting the error (my connection pool limit is 100)? P.s: We are restarting our application daily.
Sometimes it occurs some errors in my web application, these errors makes my application very slow and the first end up generating other errors. Usually the regular application runs with 100 + users, sometimes it happens less. This usually occurs a few days after starting the server. When the problem occurs, I try to restart the jboss and mysql but the application back slowly. Some characteristics of the application: Constant database access (An example is checking for new messages in chat, for each user is checked every 10-60 seconds if there is a new message) We have an average of 30 users online and may even reach 300. We use Amazon AWS server (m.large) We use a Controller architecture -> Business -> DAO Here are a few lines from the error log generated by Jboss: 14:33:19,450 WARN [com.arjuna.ats.arjuna]

I am trying to build up a Java (Java version build 1.8.0_11-b12) Maven Web Application (built up in NetBeans 8.0) that runs on Wildfly-8.1.0.Final using JPA (EclipseLink JPA 2.1) for accessing a MySQL database. The host system is Ubuntu 14.04 64Bit. I have successfully created the datasource on Wildfly to the database on MySQL. Testing the connection sends back a message saying it was successful. Therefore, I think Wildfly should be working fine. I then created a very simple Entity Class "Dog.java" for persisting. The problem comes up when I compile the WAR file and copy it for deployement on the Wildfly server. Wildfly sends back endless yellow warning messages and I am not able to kill Wildfly or Java. The only way out is to restart the entire operating system. Does anyone know this problem? Or das anyone see any problem in my configuration? Does maybe anyone know a Howto somewhere on the net that explains Step-by-Step how to create a Web Application for Wildfly accessing a database with JPA? I already tried to find one, but was not successful. Every help highly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

I have the below scenario: I am putting a message in a MQ queue and some other application is polling in the same queue. I have came across a scenario like this: My application tries to put the message into the queue, but it experiences MQJE001: An MQException occurred: Completion Code '2', Reason '2018'. I have a retry logic if my application fails to put the message into the queue. So my application tries to put the message in the queue. This time it is able to put the message in the queue again. Now the problem appear is the other application which was polling the queue for the message, received two messages. I am using MQ server version 7.0.1.8 and MQ client version 7.0.1.5. My doubts are as below: Why the message put twice in queue even though the first time I experienced MQJE001: An MQException occurred: Completion Code '2', Reason '2018'. Is there any autocommit flag in MQ? Where can I get more details on this? I have done google on it, but does not get proper information. I checked the below link, but nothing related to MQ autocommit flag. Committing and backing out units of work Is the difference in server version and client version matters? From the APAR IV22989, I have seen there is a fix from IBM for MQJE001: An MQException occurred: Completion Code '2', Reason '2018'. Is this only applicable to V7.1 and V7.5?
I need to create an Eclipse Debugger Plugin that is able to debug embedded code, running at a Cortex-M0 core. My plugin depends on an existing plugin for debugging arm applications: GNU ARM Eclipse JLink plugin (http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/blog/) My debugger plugin should be able to send information (like src code line, file etc) to a java application when a breakpoint is hit and when the user presses resume and suspend button. According to https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Debugger/how-to.html , I have to implement my own Eclipse Debug Model I have managed to create a Launch Delegate that extends GNU ARM JLink plugin LaunchConfigurationDelegate class, so that I do not have to rewrite the code that initializes the debug environment. From the GNU ARM Eclipse JLink plugin src code, I understand that it does not extend the default functionality of Eclipse when a breakpoint is hit or the user presses resume,step into etc. So I do not have an existing jlink plugin class to extend. In my debug model I created classes that implement IDebugTarget, IStackFrame, IThread and extend DebugElement among others. I thought that by implementing classes from org.eclipse.debug.core.model.ISuspendResume & org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IStep I would be able to catch breakpoint hit events and stepping events. But still, I can not catch any debug events in my plugin code. Do you have any hints on how to catch debug events in my plugin (suspend,resume,step into,step over etc) from the Eclipse UI? Could you inform me which classes should I extend or which interfaces should I implement in order to catch code stepping events?
I downloaded the 64 bit Java EE IDE 64 bit version of Eclipse from this website today. Looks to be the Luna Release (4.4.0) if that matters. I can never figure out which version to download for my particular situation. I then used JD GUI (Extract source code from .jar file) to get the source code from a jar file so I can fix the source code that's broken. And then extracted the source code from the zip file in a personal folder under C:\ in Windows. After launching Eclipse, I created a project under the default workspace location, called "test1" using the most basic project type (File > New > Project). When I had a maven project in there before creating "test1", I had an errors panel that showed me build errors. (I have "Build Automatically" turned on in Eclipse) However, the errors panel is now gone. I just have the "Project Explorer" and open files tabs panel showing. I could not find how to open the errors panel. Does anyone know? I then went to File > Import > General > File System, to get a dialog called Import. I chose the root folder of the extracted zip files (from the *.jar file). I then clicked "Browse" to find "test1" project. And then clicked finish. It seems to have copied all of the files in that temp zip extraction location to the test1 location. If I start typing invalid syntax, I get no build errors. How can I see the Java build errors?
I am using Mac OS X 10.8.4. Recently i have started using android studio. I installed Homebrew and got installed gradle. I need to try the example for kickflip android SDK, so i checked out the project from GitHub. But the project is not getting launched. It is showing the error Execution failed for task ':app:packageDebug'. > class org.bouncycastle.asn1.ASN1Primitive overrides final method equals.(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z I know similar questions has been asked in the stackoverflow itself. Problems launching error in Android Studio... Android Studio 0.2.7 build exception with Gradle Gradle error in app:packageDebug... Android Studio Bouncy castle issue (newbie) I tried the solutions provided in those but of no help. I am using java 1.7.0_09. java -version gives java version "1.7.0_09" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_09-b05) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.5-b02, mixed mode) and the gradle is up todate. Please help if anyone encountered the same issue and got fixed.
I was looking at What is the correct Eclipse setup for JHipster? and decided I have a similar question with enough differences to warrant posting a separate question. I am able to build and run a jhipster app using yo that seems to run ok (I choose defaults with the exception of the database - which is MySQL in both local and prod, plus websockets, and "y" to the CSS package). I am then able to import the maven project into STS 3.5 and run it ok from there as well. The only thing I'd like to figure out is why all of this seems to work even when there are so many DTD, JSON, XML and even one Java error reporting in STS for this project? Should I choose to ignore some of these validations in my STS project, or are these legitimate jhipster bugs?

My code is written in jsp for importing product from CSV file . The process is working fine for less then 300 - 400 products importing. But when I try with large number of rows like 1000 or more, it gives me below error because of its long process. I am using Google App Engine with Google cloud SQL. This problem does not occur only with this product import system. But I observed many times, it is due to long process time execution. Note : Working well in local system but problem occurs after deploying on google app server 500 Server Error Error: Server Error The server encountered an error and could not complete your request.Please try again in 30 seconds. Is there any special configuration in jsp or servlet file ? Is this issue related to any session expiry time ? (i also tried with session.setMaxInactiveInterval(500000)) Is there any configuration on google-app-engine ? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance..!!
I'm working on Android development for the first time and I have a couple sample apps I've been running to make sure Eclipse is configured correctly, so I know it's not the code that's causing these issues. I keep on getting these two errors when I try to build: 1) R cannot be resolved to a variable From what I've read, this will go away once I've successfully built a version, and R.java is created. If I've misunderstood this, please let me know. 2) error: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar' This one I understand to be the main issue. I've read a bunch of different answers here, this looks like a common problem, but I can't get mine to work out. I assume the issue has to do with this Please help steer me in the right direction, I've been googling this all day and tried a ton of stuff but it's just not working. Thanks for any help!
I've got a problem with the apache poi excel api (xlsx). I'm using android studio and I've added the poi libs to the "libs" folders. This error is popping up for some reason (see below). How would I solve it?, could you please explain how you identified the issue? xmlbeans-2.6.0, poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10.1-20140818, poi-ooxml-3.10.1-20140818, poi-3.10.1-20140818, log4j-1.2.13, junit-4.11, dom4j-1.6.1, commons-logging-1.1, commons-codec-1.5 Thanks!

Hi I have several WP8 apps that I want to add turn based functionality as a quiz like app similar to QuizUp using AppWarps2. As a first step I sucessfully installed and setup the chat server app from the tutorial here: http://appwarps2.shephertz.com/dev-center/ All worked O.K. I then downloaded the QuizUp like trivia game from the samples page and have been having trouble getting it started. http://appwarps2.shephertz.com/downloads/download-onpremwarp.php 1) I ran the server as in the previous chat server sample using the server files providec with the quiz game sample using windows_start.bat. (just like the previous sample) 2) Created a java project and imported the file system for the java server folder provided with the trivia game sample and added the .jar file to the build path and ran the program. 3) Logged in to the AppWarp Dashboard and created a zone and room (just like the previous sample) also added room properties IsPrivateRoom = false. (server command window & Eclipse console now displays the zone and room just created) 4) I ran the trivia game sample in VS2013 having changed the global context variables API_KEY = "app key given when created zone in step 3 above", HOST_NAME = "127.0.0.1" and GameRoomId = "id given when I created room in step 3 above" I am always getting connection failed while trying to connect in the game! I'm running the app on the emulator! In onConnectionDone eventObj result type returns 6 (connection error)? I'm obviously new with this and the sample details stop at anything to do with windows phone so I've pieced together bits & pieces I could find! I not sure what I'm doing wrong or not at all here? Am I on the right track? How do I get a connection? Many thanks P.S. I'm also getting the following error in the debugger: System.Windows.Data Error: BindingExpression path error: 'm_FbFriendList' property not found on 'QuizMania.MainPage' 'QuizMania.MainPage' (HashCode=1166200).

I've been trying for a while to get some JUnit tests to work in a project using the Maven version of Libgdx, but did not manage to succeed. In my project I have a class that handles the audio for my game. For now the class is quite simple, and does not do much more than looking for an audio file in a folder, and playing it. I use the Gdx.app.internal() to get the file that I need, and it workd perfectly fine when running the game. Now when I write a test file, which is in the root/core/target/test-classes/.... folder, the Gdx.app.internal() immediately throws an exception. When using FileHandle.exists(), it returns true when running from the game, but false when I run it from tests. My guess is that it might have to do with some dependencies that Libgdx needs, and when running the game normally all is set for you. Thus I tried looking up some other topics that discuss this, but did not manage to find much information about it. So to summarize my question: Is it allowed to call for Gdx.files.internal() in a JUnit test case? If not, what is the best way to go about testing classes in your Libgdx project?
Is there a way to let my @ExceptionHandler methods have access to the model attributes populated by the @RequestMapping method that triggered the exception in question? Or, more specifically for my problem: my models passed to my views have some data populated from @ModelAttribute (such as detailed information on the user account) methods, and I'd like those to be also set in my @ExceptionHandler methods. For instance, since my error view page uses the same header and menu as my other pages, I want to show the current user name (and other info, such as number of unread messages etc). I know the @ExceptionHandler exists outside the @Transaction (as it should!), so I obviously can't just (and don't want to) run some queries again. Rather, I'd like to pre-populate the ModelMap or ModelAndView or whatever, and make sure the exception handler gets hold of that - or at least that the model data is made available when rendering the view. I hope this question makes sense, I'm fairly new to Spring MVC so I may be mixing a few concepts here and there...
I'm having a rather annoying problem in my Java application which was put together in Netbeans. When I build the project it tells me everything is fine. I compile it in command prompt and it tells me everything is fine. When I run the .jar locally on my computer (from anywhere including external storage) the application opens just fine. When I open it on another computer or from command prompt it tells me there was a class not found exception. I have done everything from editing the manifest to sacrificing a blank text document named "virgin" to invoke Boolius, the god of computers. Nothing is working out. I have even made a second test app inside Netbeans with a main class that opens a JFram and NOTHING ELSE. It has the "public static void main(string[] args)" line there and accounted for. Same exact problem. I have made all my constructors public. I have made sure I'm using the latest java jdk. I have ensured that my main class is in fact the main class. I have read through all the manuals and tutorials the internet has to offer one after the other with no avail. What can I do? What can I try?
When I execute mvn release:perform on a parent POM, the server is responding with this error about one of the child projects (filenames redacted): [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-deploy-plugin:2.7:deploy-file (default-cli) on project: Failed to deploy artifacts: Could not transfer artifact from/to repository: Failed to transfer file. Return code is: 400, ReasonPhrase: Bad Request. However, all the files for this child project are successfully uploaded! I see a new directory (named after the release version number) and it contains all the .jar, .pom, .md5, and .sha1 files one would expect. I don't have access to the Nexus server, but I'm wondering what might cause this and how to fix it. Is it possible that Maven is trying to upload this particular child project twice? If so, why would Maven be doing this and how can I stop it? UPDATE: If you're having the same problem, check out the answer with the most upvotes in this post. I ran mvn help:effective-pom and found that the project in question actually had two executions of the deploy phase. Removing one of those executions solved my problem.
I would like to set up my test-logging so that log output is mainly suppressed - unless a test fails. then I would like to have the debug output. I know the manual solution of just modifying the log4j.properties in the test classpath or just having debug logging always active for tests - but I don't want to spam the console with unnessesary output for green tests. For failing tests I want the automatic build to give me the debug output in case there are some weired environment issues going on. I have been thinking there should be an appender that could be combined with a junit rule that supresses output until the result of the test is known and then only deferes logging to another appender if the test has failed. I could probably make this myself, but I wonder if anyone has tried this before or if there are better solutions to the problem.

I get the following error in my application: Error has occured with message: [com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.transaction.arjunacore.commitwhenaborted] [com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.transaction.arjunacore.commitwhenaborted] Could not commit transaction. Somewhere in my code I expect there is an exception being thrown that is being swallowed without re-throwing or printing the stacktrace and that marks my transaction as dirty. The set of code under suspicion is quite large (very large) so just stepping through it won't cut it. Eclipse supports breaking whenever a exception is thrown, caught or uncaught. Problem is that I'm running in the context of JBoss which also throws exceptions. Is there a way with the exception filtering to tell Eclipse to only break on code that is in a certain package and its sub packages. The keyword here being sub packages. I can't add just the packages I want because the list of packages is large. Hundreds of potential ones. All of our packages start with za.co so was wondering if there was a way to specify something like za.co.** which would match za.co and all of the sub packages.
I created an application on Eclipse that is connected to a sqlite database that is located in the folder project. I'm using the xerial sqlite-jdbc driver and swing for objects. When I run my application on Eclipse it works fine, but when I export the application to a single jar file it shows me the error: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.sqlite.jdbc I tried adding the sqlite-jdbc jar file to the classpath (I'm sure that I pressed ENTER in the manifest), running this example from xerial: java -classpath ".;sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar" But it always show the error. I read and downloaded an example from here: http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/815186/Java-JDBC-SQLite-Read-Data-from-User-selected-db-T?msg=4911364#xx4911364xx It's made in NetBeans and when I create the jar file for that project it doesn't have the same problem, I noticed that the jar "sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar" it's included when I create the jar file for the project, but when I create the jar file for my project it doesn't include that file. Using winrar I copied the "sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar" file to the jar file of my project but it always shows the same error.(You'll think that I'm crazy trying this, but I had try a lot of things) I had read all the question and answers on this web and other webs that presents similar or the same error, but nothing happen. If some one knows what can I will appreciate any help
I have written a server in Haskell which passes messages to connected clients. If the connection drops from one of the clients, it takes several minutes for my server to notice that the client is gone. hGetLine in Haskell is blocking and I can't close the thread if it's still listening (there is a way with async, but it's not working for me). If I write to the broken pipe from that client, I get a broken pipe exception in Java and have to make a new socket. Implementing heartbeats to check if the connection is still open could work, but if there are two telnet sessions connected to the server, it's nearly impossible to instantly reply on a heartbeat message from the server. Is there any way to notice quickly if the client is disconnected? Is there a way to use SIG_IGN to ignore the broken pipe exception in Java and write to the same pipe after Internet connectivity is restored?
i have a persistent hibernate managed @entity Obj in Hibernate, which has fields id, fieldA, and fieldB, among others. In some class i have two @Transactional methods, updateA() and updateB(). updateA() obtains an Obj by its id, does some processing, and updates its fieldA. updateB does same for fieldB. I also have two clients that continuously make requests. One client always makes requests that call updateA(), and the other client always calls updateB(). They both pass the same id of an existing Obj. Is there a way to avoid the HibernateOptimisticLockingFailureException that keeps occurring, or to handle it once successfully, given the fact that each method updates different fields? Some kind of a merge? Just to complete the picture, the thread that calls updateA() in fact calls other transactional methods similar to updateA(), but none updates fieldB. At first I just tried to catch the exception and re-try the operation a second time. But sometimes it fails the second time too... This does not seem like a good solution.
I have installed STS 3.61 on OSx Maveicks with Java 1.8.0_11 and Tomcat 8.0.12. I have started a project with (Right-click)->New->Import Spring Getting Started Content->spring-mvc-showcase; Right-click on spring-mvc-showcase->Debug->Debug On Server. I get an internal browser window with the URL java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot find class [org.springframework.samples.mvc.data.custom.CustomArgumentResolver]. The URL displays a Status 500 window with the root cause "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot find class [org.springframework.samples.mvc.data.custom.CustomArgumentResolver]". There was some good data in Import a project to STS iMac on this problem. Let me give a bit of history. I did this earlier and everything worked great. I played with upgrading some artifact versions and got this error along the way. I did some of the things in Import a project to STS iMac and it seemed to resolve the problem. After a few more changes, however, I got to the point that nothing would get rid of the error. I even tried the following sequence: remove project from Tomcat, clean Tomcat, clean project, delete project, shutdown STS, restart STS, recreate project. It still didn't work. Any suggestions before I reinstall STS and Tomcat? I really don't like this solution as it really hampers development in the long run.

I am working on a project aims to make software reuse easier. The final project provides a framework to select a desired feature from a (Java, C++) program and adds that to the another program. I am responsible for two parts of the project. Fixing possible compiler errors after the desired feature is added to the another program. Changing the desired feature to be usable in its new location. In this case the program should pass successfully all test cases (not details at the moment as my question is related to Section 1). Currently, I implemented the first step and the program can automatically fix possible compiler errors after the desired feature is added to its new location. It almost supports all Java compiler errors (even that some of them never happen in the above project), and in few of cases a user needs to help the plugin to fix the compiler error. Note that the plugin has access to both programs and using these information it will fix compiler errors. For clarity, as a very simple example in a case that there is a dependency between the desired feature with a library in its original location, the plugin tries to fix the compiler error for example by adding that library to the program. I know current IDEs provide suggestions in a case that there is a compiler error in the program, but the advantage of the current plugin is that it automatically can fix compiler errors, and does not provide a list of solutions to the user for each compiler error. The question That I am facing is that: Any one could please mention other situations that I can use the implemented automated compiler error fixing plugin? (of course except the above project). Any suggestion is welcome as it helps me to see other directions of the project.
Going through Herbert Schildt : The Complete Reference Chapter 10 Exception Handling Exception handling provides a powerful mechanism for controlling complex programs that have many dynamic run-time characteristics. It is important to think of try, throw, and catch as clean ways to handle errors and unusual boundary conditions in your program’s logic. Unlike some other languages in which error return codes are used to indicate failure, Java uses exceptions. Thus, when a method can fail, have it throw an exception. This is a cleaner way to handle failure modes. One last point: Java’s exception-handling statements should not be considered a general mechanism for nonlocal branching. If you do so, it will only confuse your code and make it hard to maintain. What does he mean by the term 'nonlocal branching'? Kindly elaborate with the help of a nice example? Note this question was asked on coderanch, but the answers there were primarily based on individual opinions and as such it didn't yield a root-based answer (I wasn't able to clarify the point with the discussions over there).
In my past life as a C/C++ programmer, it was possible on some platforms & debugger combinations to selectively suspend threads. After hitting a breakpoint, one could issue commands (or click stuff in the GUI) to ice/de-ice (suspend / wake) a thread. Upon further step/next/run/continue commands, suspended threads would not execute any instructions. Is this possible with any JVM or Java IDE today? I use IntelliJ and I don't see the feature, nor can I find any information via Google. To clarify: I am not asking about the thread policy for a breakpoint, e.g, suspend current thread or all threads. I am aware of that JVM debugger feature. The dev environment is vanilla: I use IntelliJ Java IDE, and I have access to the source code in question. Finally, I realise the "Java debugger" is a somewhat vague term. AFAIK, Sun published a debug-on-the-wire format that debuggers use to communicate with the JVM. Perhaps each JVM (IBM vs Sun vs IcedTea vs ???) supports different debug capabilities, but I am only familiar with the Sun/Oracle JVM.
I have all the logic in place to check if a user is logged in and therefore is allowed to execute a RPC call. I can place this check in all my RPC methods and throw a throw new MyLoginException() if the user is not logged in. In the client side I just check for this exception and handle it accordingly. The problem now is: I don't want to put this in every RPC method. I want a generic solution for this. I tried to override methods like com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc.RemoteServiceServlet.processCall() which is called before every RPC call. Problem here: I can only throw unchecked exception because the method signature does not allow me to throw my own exception. The unchecked exception result then in generic exception in the client code and I can not handle them correctly because I do not know anymore which exception was thrown. Where can I put my login check? Is there any clean solution for this problem?
I want to use two threads, lets call them prefetcher and client, the prefetchers job is to read an input stream ahead of the client thread and put it into some queue. The client then retrieves data from the queue to ... erm process it. Now if the prefetcher encounters an exception, I need to put a pending exception into the queue, so the client takes an exception when it reaches that point in the queue. The question is, I will have an (IO)Exception caught on the prefetcher thread, but I need to throw an appropiate exception on the client thread. My first though is just catch it, and rethrow it on the other thread. But... that clearly messes up the stack trace of the exception? So should I simply wrap it into a new exception? That would mean the "cause" is from another thread, could that cause trouble? Or must I discard the original exception completely; if somehow possible I'd like to preserve as much information as possible into the exception thrown by the client. What idioms are available (and valid) to deal with this situation?
I have different Axis2 services which expose some methods and would like to wrap those services and all their methods in something like a try catch to be able to filter all occurring exceptions before Axis2 sends them to the client. I already read about phases and flows and handlers and OutFaultFlow and such, but what I would like to have is something on the service level which can be configured by the service itself on startup time. My service should be self contained as much as possible. I already have some things per service which needs to get initialized on startup time and therefore am already implementing the interface ServiceLifeCycle Axis2 provides. But I can't seem to be able to get from the provided ConfigurationContext or AxisService to something "more higher" around the service and register some new handler for any flow or such in which I could intercept exceptions and decide how to proceed with those. Is there any way to register flow handlers or such form a service level on startup? Do you have any other idea besides adding try catch in all of my exposed methods? Thanks!

I'm trying to make a libgdx Android project work (= build) on Eclipse. It's the project from the book "Libgdx Game Development" : I just opened the GDX set up GUI and created a project named "demo". I get two errors about GWT in the "Problems" Tab, in the demo-html project : The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot find the class file for com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint. Fix the build path then try building this project 2.The type com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files I have GWT Designer for GPE, Google Plugin for Eclipse and SDKS installed in the plug-in tab (from the Help > Install new Software), so I have no idea why it doesn't work. All the questions that had those error messages were resolved by downloading the plug-ins I quoted, but in my case, they are downloaded and installed (can't re-install them since it tells me it is already installed) and I hit also already checked for updates. Thanks in advance.
In my application, I have a few RequestMappings that only allow POST. If someone happens to fire a GET request at that particular path, they get a 405 error page fed by the container (Tomcat). I can create and define a 405 error page in web.xml for customization. What I want: any request that would result in a 405 error should be handled in a specific controller method. What I've tried: a method with "method = GET" as a counterpart for each of the mappings mentioned. This works fine, but requires me to create an actual requestmapping and method for every path that only allows POST. I find this unnecessary duplication and clutter. a global 'catch' method (requestmapping /*): this does not work, as Spring takes the GET method to be a wrong call to the path specified with POST only an ExceptionHandler-annotated method to handle exceptions of class HttpRequestMethodNotSupportedException: this does not work. It seems that Spring throws and catches this exception entirely in its framework code. specify my own 405 in web.xml. This is not perfect, as I want to have customized handling rather than a static error page.
I'm looking to return per request debug information in a JSON HTTP response body. This debug information would be collected throughout my application, including data such as DB queries and how long they took, external calls made, whether certain conditions were met, general messages showing application flow etc. I've looked into Java logging frameworks and the Play Framework, which I am using, has a built in logger that works great for logging information to files. But I can't seem to find any that handle request level logging i.e. store debug messages for this particular HTTP request to be returned with this request and then destroyed. I could of course create a Debug class, instantiate that and pass that around throughout my application for each request, but this doesn't seem like a nice way to handle this as I would need to be passing this into a lot of classes in my application. Are there any better ways/design patterns/libraries out there that can do what I'm looking for without having to pass a Debug object round my entire application?
We are having issues with our deployment. We need to deploy to a remote TomCat-container which is accessed through IIS 8.5 with the TomCat Connector from Apache. We followed the guide at the following resources when we installed the connector: https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=376210448#ConfiguringTomcat-ConnectorforIIS8.0(WindowsServer2012orWindows8)-Step1.InstallandConfiguretheAJPConnector File size is not too big for IIS 8.5 (the file size is 50mb) http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/webserver_howto/iis.html Of what we can see, the .war file gets uploaded but when it should be deployed, we are returned a 404 page, telling us that the page doesnt exist and the application is not deployed. Things we have checked and double checked is the configuration for: File size limits in TomCat configuration (the file is not too big for TomCat) Security Access for the TomCat service user (NETWORK SERVICES), so that TomCat has access to the folders it needs for unpacking the .war etc. Alot of other things while we were grasping for some answer The logs of TomCat and IIS doesnt give a clue to why this issue exists, we can see that we accessed the manager and performed a PUT operation, nothing else... we have set the log level to FINE, still no clue. Logs of IIS does also not give any clues to what the issue is. We are thinking that the issue lies within IIS 8.5 and the connector but we cant find it. Thankful for anything that you might think could be a potential issue. Are there any other connectors for TomCat 7.0.55 / IIS 8.5 that might be better? Thanks / David
I am having difficulty building an android app called Commotion Wireless from its source code. This should be a simple matter of importing the project into eclipse and exporting it as an APK. However upon building I am left with three errors: two saying "isIBSS cannot be resolved or is not a field" and one saying "frequency cannot be resolved or is not a field". The lines of code producing these errors are lines 201, 202 and line 92. If I comment out these lines of code then I can generate an APK just fine, though obviously the app doesn't work as intended with these lines missing. My impression was that these errors arose due to Android not supporting ad-hoc (IBSS) networks by default (the purpose of this app is to have the android device generating an ad-hoc network). Therefore, the related definitions of isIBSS and frequency seem to be absent from the default version of android. This app, according to its creators, is intended for use on Cyanogenmod which has been modified to support ad-hoc networks and does have these definitions (see this review). Therefore my line of thought was that I had to use a modified version of the android SDK based on cyanogenmod that would have these definitions added in order for me to compile the program. However, as far as I can tell, no such thing exists. Is my line of thought here correct, and does anyone have any solutions to offer for this problem? Please bear in mind I only have a basic understanding of Java and have never tried to compile an android app before.
I'm developing a GWT application. It's using RPC to collect information from an internal system. It does so by using a library jar, lets call it alpha.jar. We are using this jar in many application so it works fine, and btw its built with ANT, outside eclipse. Some classes in alpha.jar references LOG4J2 and also lots of other external jars, so when we run an application we pass a classpath to all those, and everything works out fine. Please note that this is not a simple beginners problem. The alpha.jar is working as it should, including calls to Log4J. The problem: In Eclipse, I have this GWT application project and also the Alpha.jar project (with source code of course). The server part needs to instatiate alpha objects and communicate to the alpha system. When do this in GWT by adding a build-path-reference to the Alpha project, my GWT app runs fine. When I instead of the project reference include (in war/WEB-INF/lib) the alpha.jar and runs the app, I get the error in the title the first time I instantiate a class from alpha.jar. There are no peculiarities in how the alpha.jar is built, so basically it should be the same thing as the project in eclipse, right? Note the following: *) The alpha.jar's dependent jars are also in war/WEB-INF/lib. log4j2-core, log4j-api as well as a bunch of others (apache common for example) *) If I remove the alpha.jar (and the code that calls it) and instead just add code that called LOG4J2, that code also works fine! How come I get this weird error when using the JAR?? Note also the NoClassDefFoundError, its not the more common ClassNotFoundException. Pls see What causes and what are the differences between NoClassDefFoundError and ClassNotFoundException? If you need more info let me know.
I was developing an Android app and in one of the sections, I pass data using an Intent from a DatePicker dialog fragment back to the fragment that created it using getTargetFragment().onActivityResult(int targetRequestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent). I am adding three integers (date, month and year) extracted from the Calendar fragment to the intent being passed. And then I read this intent within the onActivityResult() method of the fragment that created it. Everything works as it should and all is fine and dandy and the world is a perfect place to live in. While I was trying to debug a silly error that I had made, I noticed something interesting. When I expand the content of the intent, I find that my data is in a bundle as expected. But I see that there is another object within the intent called android.util.ArrayMap with size 3. This size seems to correspond to the number of data that I put in the intent (I tested it by adding additional dummy parameters). when I expand the contents of the ArrayMap, I see that it throws a ClassNotFoundException. Why would it do this. The key type is String and the value type is Integer (I am putting an int but I don't think it matters as I added in String for key and value and it still threw the exception). I expanded the ArrayMap details but it did not seem to make sense. My questions are: Why is this ClassNotFoundException happening? What is the need for the ArrayMap in the first place?

Morning all. I work on maintaining a complex Java application that uses dozens of megabytes of third-party libraries. Recently I've been working on isolating a part of it to run as a standalone application, which by and large depends on the same source files as its parent. It's basically one complex wizard dialog from the original application, which still exists in the original application and which I don't want to maintain twice. Installed alongside the whole application, the standalone part works fine. But now I want to make a standalone distribution. The part I've isolated still needs some third-party libraries, but I don't know which ones. Many of the classes involved have multipurpose constructors that can take some complex UI objects from the original application, and all the libraries that make them work have to be there at compile-time, but the execution path will be sharply curtailed at run-time. Is there some way that I can configure Eclipse to monitor which libraries are being loaded during debugging? Either a plugin or some core functionality I've missed? Thanks.
I just installed multitenant single-db 0.8.3 but can't compile helloworld example. I have errors on plugin java. May be I am missing some basic setup, but I did not find any more info on doc. See below. symbol: class DeleteEvent location: class HibernateEventListener /home/scarpa/Grails/helloworld/target/work/plugins/hibernate-hijacker-0.8.1/src/java/grails/plugin/hibernatehijacker/hibernate/events/HibernateEventListener.java:168: error: cannot find symbol public void onAutoFlush(AutoFlushEvent event) throws HibernateException { ^ symbol: class AutoFlushEvent location: class HibernateEventListener /home/scarpa/Grails/helloworld/target/work/plugins/hibernate-hijacker-0.8.1/src/java/grails/plugin/hibernatehijacker/hibernate/events/HibernateEventListener.java:172: error: cannot find symbol private void publishEvent(String eventName, AbstractEvent event) { ^ symbol: class AbstractEvent location: class HibernateEventListener Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.

I am trying to understand the spring-social-showcase example in Eclipse and wants to browse the source code for its dependent projects. When I try to jump to some declaration found in the spring social core package, I get the below error: Class file editor Source Not found: The jar file .....spring-social-core-1.1.0.RELEASE.jar has no source attachment. You can attach the source... I tried these by reading the SO posts which didn't work for me: Attach Source -> External Location -> External file and pointed to "spring-social-1.1.0.RELEASE.zip" in my system. Attach Source -> External Location -> External folder and pointed to "spring-social-1.1.0.RELEASE" folder in my system. Attach Source -> External Location -> External folder and pointed to "spring-social-1.1.0.RELEASE\spring-social-core\src\main\java\org\springframework\social\connect" folder where the specific java file lies. In Project properties -> Java build path -> Libraries, specified the source attachment by pointing to the "spring-social-1.1.0.RELEASE.zip". In Project properties -> Java build path -> Source, added folder as linked folder. In Project properties -> Java build path -> Projects, added project as a dependent project. All of these have failed for me and still I am seeing this error. Is there a problem with my Eclipse installation? How should I confirm this? I am on verge of madness now, please save me.
I am using the “postgresql-9.3-1102.jdbc3.jar” in order to connect to the database. When I have one exception e.g. one null value, I can use several ways in order to catch the exception. e.g. try { ............} catch (PSQLException seRs) { ......... } Or try {.......} catch (SQLException se) {.......} Or try { .......} catch (Exception se) { ........ } My Goal is to catch the specific SQLState in the cases that I am interesting. For example I want to catch the invalid NULL value of one field, the Postgress returns the value “23502” SQLState but in any of the prior “catches” I can’t do it because the Error code is inherited I can’t check it. In the previous “catches” I can have the “.getmessage” but this is not helping me i want to check the SqlState Thanks for any ideas.
because of a high priority security fix in cordova for android we need to update our cordova version (from 2.7.0 to 3.6.3) in our app. So we thought it would be better to create a new project. I installed cordova and create a project with cordova cli api. Also I added the android platform added many cordova plugins. Then I copied our sencha touch stuff into the www folder. Then I called "cordova build android" (before I also called "cordova prepare android"). After that I imported this android project in Android Studio (0.8.11). I needed to configure the gradle files a bit (buildToolsVersion, etc.) For our app I needed to copy the following things from our old project AndroidManifest.xml All the stuff out of the res/ directory in the src/ directory I added some stuff we need in our app Then I recognized that the android-support android-support-v13.jar library was missing in the lib/ folder. So I copied it out of the sdk\extras\android\support\v13 directory. After that nearly all red stuff in the code disappeared, so I tried to run it. The app starts but I'm getting many errors like: "Cordova exec fail: Class not found". So I looked into our src/ directory and there in our java files. There is everything red because the impor of import org.apache.cordova.*; or import org.apache.cordova.CallbackContext; import org.apache.cordova.CordovaPlugin; fails. The needed java files I found in /CordovaLib/ant-build/classes/com/org/apacke/cordova/ Is there anything which I still need to configure? My gradle file dependencies: dependencies { compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar') for (subproject in getProjectList()) { compile project(subproject) } } Please help me/ Thanks ahead!! :-)
We are running our calculations in a standalone Spark cluster, ver 1.0.2 - the previous major release. We do not have any HA or recovery logic configured. A piece of functionality on the driver side consumes incoming JMS messages and submits respective jobs to spark. When we bring the single & only Spark master down (for tests), it seems the driver program is unable to properly figure out that the cluster is no longer usable. This results in 2 major problems: The driver tries to reconnect endlessly to the master, or at least we couldn't wait until it gives up. Because of the previous point, submission of new jobs blocks (in org.apache.spark.scheduler.JobWaiter#awaitResult). I presume this is because the cluster is not reported unreacheable/down and the submission simply logic waits until the cluster comes back. For us this means that we run out of the JMS listener threads very fast since they all get blocked. There are a couple of akka failure detection-related properties that you can configure on Spark, but: The official documentation strongly doesn't recommend enabling akka's built-in failure detection. I would really want to understand how this is supposed to work by default. So, can anyone please explain what's the designed behavior if a single spark master in a standalone deployment mode fails/stops/shuts down. I wasn't able to find any proper doc on the internet about this.
According to the JavaCC documentation, if I want to customize the messages given by errors in the lexer: To customize error reporting by the lexer, the lexer class must be subclassed and this method [LexicalError() in TokenMgrError] redefined in the subclass. To help with creating your error reporting scheme, the following variables are available: However, I see nothing about how to get the generated code to use that subclass, unlike with the TOKEN_FACTORY option. On the other hand, looking in the TokenMgrError source, some comments indicate that the source file should be directly edited, rather than subclassed. However, if I do that, the next time I change the .jj file and have Ant regenerate the parser and lexer code, I get this warning: Warning: TokenMgrError.java: File is obsolete. Please rename or delete this file so that a new one can be generated for you. So, how am I supposed to be doing this?
I was working on an app about a year ago, and kinda forgot about it for some time. I want to get back into it, but every import has an error. I feel like I am just forgetting something simple, but I dont know what it is. standard java projects (non-android) work fine, but anything android related has errors. I tried updating to the newest sdk (23.0.2), but that did not fix the problems. here is a screenshot of what is going on. Edit: I also just insalled the newest build tools, and all the extras in the android sdk manager. This did not fix the problem. edit 2: It seems that if I go to the Library build paths, the JRE System Library can't be added. If I added, the name of it changes to "Unable to get system library for this project" This only happens with android projects, and not with non-android projects. Final edit: the problem was fixed by changing the android target version
I've been working on building an MS paint like program for a class, but I've just realize that the TA marks in Linux and I've been building my program on a Mac. I didn't think it was going to be a big deal, but I thought I'd test it on a linux anyways, and I'm getting errors that won't let me even open the program. I'm getting "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: No such child: 0 thrown at frame.pack(); in my main method and all over the place in Container and JComponent, ect and Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: No such child: 0thrown at Container and JComponent and BorderLayouts. I have no idea where the problem is, so I've just put the whole program up on pasteBin. I really have no idea what I've done and I don't have any idea how to fix it. This works 100% fine on my Mac. I don't understand what the difference between the operating systems are. If anyone could please help I really need it. http://pastebin.com/KDKm7D9w
I have the following error when deploying an application with JBoss Tools in Eclipse: Error renaming C:\wildfly-8.1.0.Final\standalone\tmp\tmp7858611943756287857.xhtml to C:\wildfly-8.1.0.Final\standalone\deployments\.war\403.xhtml. This may be caused by your server's temporary deploy directory being on a different filesystem than the final destination. You may adjust these settings in the server editor. And here is a screenshot of the error: On the documentation, I found this: You can customize the deployment location and packaging type: To select the workspace deployment folder for the server, click Use workspace metadata. To select the deployment folder of the application server, click Use the JBoss deploy folder. To select a folder of your choice, click Use a custom deploy folder. With this option, complete the Deploy directories and Temporary Deploy Directory fields. The temporary folder must be on the same file system as the final deploy location otherwise publishing often fails. For all modules to be archived for deployment, select the Deploy projects as compressed archives check box. This avoids exploded deployments and reduces the amount of memory deployments occupy but may result in slower deployment. What does The temporary folder must be on the same file system as the final deploy location mean? How can I solve it? I've realized that the error doesn't occur when the check box Deploy projects as compressed archives is checked.
I'm seeing some very strange effects after modifying column metadata in a columnfamily after executing the following CQL query: ALTER TABLE keyspace_name.table_name ADD column_name cql_type; I have a cluster of 4 nodes on two data centers (Cassandra version 2.0.9). I also have two application servers talking to the Cassandra cluster via the datastax java driver (version 2.0.4). After executing this kind of query I see no abnormal behaviour whatsoever (no exceptions detected at all), however long I wait. But once I restart my application on one of the servers I immediately start seeing errors on the other server. What I mean by errors is that after getting my data into a ResultSet, I try to deserialize it row by row and get 'null' values or values from other columns instead of the ones I expect. After restarting the second server (the one that is getting the errors) everything gets back to normal. I've tried investigating both the logs of datastax-agent and cassandra on both the servers but there is nothing to be found. Is there a 'proper procedure' to altering the columnfamily? Does anyone have any idea as to what may be the problem? Thanks!
I am trying to generate arrays of type double, which can reach sizes in excess of 60 million. Moreover, I need to iteratively generate larger and larger arrays (begin with say 20000, iterate through my code x no. of times successively inflating my array size by a factor of 10 or 2, depending on the output in an iteration). At the end of each iteration i, I am setting the reference of my array of size xi to null, then pointing it to a newly generated array of size x(i+1) which is > xi. However, I am eventually running out of memory in eclipse with the usual Java Heap space out of memory error. I tinkered with the Xmx, Xms values in the eclipse.ini but with no luck. I also tried the System.gc() to suggest garbage collection to java after setting the array reference to null, again with no luck. I need these large arrays because I am simulating a random process, collecting its output in these arrays (so I am using some additional objects to generate this array which also use up some memory). Then I feed this array to my main algorithm which performs a set of statistical computations on it. I get the out of memory error while generating the array with additional number of observations. Is there anyway that I can overcome this out of memory issue? Would setting individual elements of array to null instead of the array itself help in freeing up the memory? Thanks in advance for for any advice.
I'm using Junit to run tests with Seleniun WebDriver. I'm trying to split up my tests into function area for better error reporting. I've created tests to test Page load/moving documents to other workflows. If a page load test fails, or a workflow move fails I want to skip the subsequent page/workflow tests. if a Test A fails how can I skip either the rest of the tests in the class or running tests in Class B? NOTE: I realize what I'm asking is "bad Practice* for UNIT TESTS. However, I'm actually using Junit for Integration and/or Automation Testing. (Depending on your definition.) I've already found @Suite.SuiteClasses, and @FixMethodOrder to order my test classes and test methods. I'm trying to order them to run logically, testing the page load, first, then each feature of the page as a seperate test. Some of the features, move the information to other pages, meanining other classes. 1 of my classes can take over 1/2 hour to finish. If the pre-req tests fail, I'd like to short circuite the "Dependent" tests, in order to get my results/report sooner.
Assume during app development you created 5 different exception classes to use throughout your code. You then noticed, that all of these exceptions are handled in the same way. Say all you do for all 5 exceptions, when they're caught, you log a message. There's nothing else you're doing (or can do) to recover from the exception being thrown. The question is: Is the same handling a good enough reason to replace all 5 different exception classes with one. Or is there some real value in having 5 different exceptions because their names (the names of the exception classes) can help to understand the problem and ease debugging or any other reason.... Or to rephrase it: When you create a new exception class in your code, is it when you can see that there can be a unique handling of this exception in the code or is it to aptly describe the problem with the exception class name?
I am getting the following error when i try to deploy my gwt application in apache tomcat-7.0.55.I am not getting any error if i directly run it as a webapplication from eclipse.I have attched the error log for details.

I'm completely tired of using the NetBeans IDE 8.x (currently using 8.0.1) for months - it just looks like a hell (seriously). When some external changes are made to the project (especially a Java EE web application - containing hundredth of Java classes in different packages) or an attempt is made to Clean and Build to project (especially to the enterprise module), Background Scanning of Projects is initiated which unusually propagates compile-time errors in almost all classes in which classes from the JPA generated static metamodel are used in the EJB module as can be seen in the following snap shot. Surprisingly, these erroneous classes, if opened in the IDE, no compile-time errors (indicated by a red curly line) are shown anymore by the IDE - I cannot say the reason because I myself do not know. Sometimes, if the IDE is restarted, it initiates Background Scanning of Projects that may remove these errors (in most cases it does not), if the IDE it restarted again and again for at least 10 times! When and why this happens is quite uncertain but there one certain thing - it happens because of the JPA generated static metamodel. The IDE apparently becomes unaware of the classes that end with an underscore (the classes of the metamodel). This is merely a wastage of time - it takes hours or days to build an application - I had to create all of these classes all over again from scratch one by one several times. This did not happen prior to the version 8.x. Both 8.0 and 8.0.1 have the same issue (I'm not even quite sure about whether it is an issue or not. While using NetBeans 8.0, I incorrectly assumed that the later release would not impose this behaviour). To reproduce this problem, The application must have a JPA generated static metamodel. The application should (not must) be using a Class Library that holds interfaces for remote EJBs. In very small applications, this may or may not happen (I myself cannot confirm about the cause of this problem quite well and cannot say anything about this). Does someone encounter this kind of problems while using NetBeans IDE especially 8.x - this makes almost impossible to develop an application using this IDE - it is merely a frustration? Does the IDE have some settings that I might be missing? Might I be deploying the application in a wrong way? I can say only one thing - The Background Scanning of Project is performed incorrectly by the IDE or it is just a hell. The way I deploy the application (Java EE containing some remote EJBs (including many local EJBs) which are held by a Class Library) Clean and Build the Class Library Clean and Build the Enterprise application (the EJB module denoted by a triangle by the IDE) (this step is the culprit) Clean and build the Class Library again (after completion of the above two steps) Deploy the application These steps are performed at the very first time the application is built or some major changes are made to the application. Otherwise, only the last two steps are sufficient to deploy the application to the server (and I do it usually). With this problem, it is almost impossible to proceed. Is there any (at least temporary) solution/workaround to this? One additional thing. This not only happens in Java EE applications but I have another project that uses Spring in which this problem often happens. EDIT : Sometimes (again uncertain when this may happen), major options including Clean and Build of the submenu of a Class Library are disabled preventing us from doing Clean and Build as indicated by the following snap shot (right click on the Class Library to open the submenu). Which is enabled, when the IDE is restarted for random number of times (1 time, 2 times, 5 times, 10 times or even more. It is completely uncertain how many times restarting the IDE can make those options of the submenu enable). EDIT 2 : The application uses the following major components. JSF 2.2.8-02 PrimeFaces 5.1 (Community Release) PrimeFaces Extension 2.1.0 (Community Release) OmniFaces 1.8.1 EclipseLink 2.5.2 having JPA 2.1 (along with EclipseLink JPA ModelGen) Java EE 7 GlassFish Server 4.1 NetBeans IDE 8.0.1 JDK 8u25
I am very new to android programming and new to eclipse and SDK/JDK in general. I've come across tutorials and currently following 2 of them. I want to resolve all these red x marks that I get every time I create a new android application project and googling hasn't gotten me specific solutions. I've downloaded and installed the current SDK and JDK I then went to install new software from Help > Install New Software... > Add Repository > https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/ and now I get this: http://imgur.com/a/nczFs I went to check the errors and have noticed the Android Resources are at a different API level than what I installed from the SDK Manager, my cell phone is on 4.4.4 kit kat so it would make sense to work on 4.4 kit kat from the SDK Manager but the Android Resources is at API 21 while I'm on API 19. Is this due to API incompatibility? I needed +10 reputation in order to post images so I uploaded the images on imgur instead and posted the link. Sorry in advance to make you go through the troubles of opening another link.
I saw that this problem has other "ASK" here but my situation is a little different. I work with a SVN and after a commit that someone gave two days ago i can´t work anymore. Everytime that i download the project from SVN it´s ok , but when i close eclipse, i close glassfish and i start them again i get this error: error occurred during the build initializing java tooling eclipse this append just at the beginning, when eclipse has just been started. I saw that the version that gives the error changed the .classpath and the oracle.eclipse.tools.glassfish.syslib.xml, while all other classe are normal classes that in my opinion cannot create all this problems. furthermore if i close the error message dialog whit the "java initzialazing error" i start to recive many other kind of errors, and if i try to deploy my project into glassfish it says that the listener cannot find the class in my project. So in my opinion my error is related with the .classpath or/and with oracle.eclipse.tools.glassfish.syslib.xml. I´ll appreciate anykind of help of suggestion that could help me
I'm thinking of developing a maven plugin which will cause your maven build to output info messages and above if the build fails. The context is that I'd like to configure maven to work with warn by default and disable all logs of my company (this will be done by logback configuration) and I'd like to have a plugin which talks to another in-memory logback appender to get the entire log to throw to the user in case the build fails since at that point all the data is relevant. My question is if and how I can get that "notification" that the build failed? For those interested my intention, which I still need to validate, is then to programmatically change the consoleAppender back to info and write everything that was accumulated to it. I was asked about my motivations and so there are two. The first is that I think (still crunching data to see if I'm right) that our build logs are so verbose it's effecting our build times. The second is that some of our tests cause exceptions to be thrown as part of them which confuse the logs. I'd still like the entire log in case the build fails so that developers have all the info they need to debug their failure
This is the assignment that was give to me. But I can't seem to understand what is wrong with my program and how to go about fixing it. It just keeps rolling dice non-stop and freezes my JCreator. I even tried changing the NUMBER value to 10 and it still does the same thing. I have declared all the variables. You need to add code to simulate rolling the dice and keeping track of the doubles. Convert the algorithm below to Java and place it in the main method after the variable declarations, but before the output statements. You will be using several control structures: a while loop and an if-else- if statement nested inside another if statement. Use the indenting of the algorithm to help you decide what is included in the loop, what is included in the if statement, and what is included in the nested if-else-if statement. To “roll” the dice, use the nextInt method of the random number generator to generate an integer from 1 to 6.
before you read this let me tell you that please don't reply that this is repeated or check this link or the other. I know and I have checked many links and suggestions but still need you look at this as well. making the story short: ENV: java 32 bit 1.6 update 38 jboss 5.1. GA RAM on server 8 GB JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256M -Xmx1024M study case: the load of the server (web service calls) increased and we started to see this since then. server log shows below exception: Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread and also sometimes: 2014-10-03 10:33:45,200 ERROR [STDERR] (AWT-Windows) java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: OutOfMemoryError OBSERVATIONS DURING LAST THREE DAYS: OS memory performance monitoring: the commit memory is increasing slowly jvisualvm data: no heap space issue observed, GC doing its job properly so I dont see any leak there. thread dump shows many WAIT threads! I tracked our application packages in the heap dump and did not find any big issue (still investigating) however I think we are not managing the threads properly. number of threads after jboss restart increases form 50 to 260 threads and never decreases even on idle situation when there is no activity on the server. it seems strange to me. heap usage is up to 400 MB which is way lesser than max 1024 MV Now I hope, really hope someone can guide me through this and help me to resolve it. what I think is that the stack is small? or our application is not handling threads properly. could you kindly help me? thanks.
I have a problem where every time I redeploy my app, any existing sessions are broken and the requests result in a ViewExpiredException. None of the advice in related questions or outside mailing list / forum posts seems to fix this issue. I can redeploy the same WAR file completely unchanged and the behavior is the same. I'm using Apache MyFaces 2.2.0, Tomcat 7.0.56 and Primefaces 5.0. The message of the exception is No saved view state could be found for the view identifier: with whatever page would be requested. Primefaces' menubar is used for navigation, which seems to be implemented as a <form> with POST requests. These messages occur both with those navigation options and other AJAX that uses POST. I have tried: Setting explicit org.apache.myfaces.SECRET and org.apache.myfaces.MAC_SECRET values, as seen in this document. Both client and server values for the javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD parameter. Ensuring all beans and their transitive fields are serializable. No serialization errors are reported in the logs. Using a filter to add no-cache headers, e.g. as suggested in this answer. Session persistence is not disabled, that is my context.xml has <Manager pathname="" /> commented out.
For instance, lets say I want to have a generic program that creates a thread to run the code from a .java file specified in, say, a JFileChooser, and runs it either line by line or up until a certain line, and prints each change from the debugger, or at least functions like one (I.E prints the value of inside of data structures and variables). While writing this out, this sounds like a normal IDE or something I can get by just running and debugging it myself, but lets say I want an easier way of debugging than having to go through each step myself and look at the debugger, scroll down, expand the value I want to check, then scroll down again, etc. Most of the time when I debug, I get a lot of information I don't really care for, so I want to limit to only values in all of the variables, rather than it's properties, etc. This seems like a rather big project, or maybe it isn't and is in reality simple. Either way, I want to create a project that... 1. Has a thread that runs code a specified .java file 2. A Thread that prints value changes in the first thread (To make it easier, I could just have a GUI and have it update each value and step. I.E (String[] names => [],["Joe Shmoe"], ["Joe Shmoe", "Kyle Stanly"], [], etc.) 3. An ability to read it line by line, or at the very least, record the ongoing changes that occurred so I could go back and look at it. 4. Throw any errors to be looked over to, say, another textbox that contains the stacktrace. I'd like to know if this is possible, and if so where to start. If I do manage to do it, it'd help me debug any future projects I attempt as well.
Spring security was working fine in all terms except for remember-me feature(simple remember me approach not using persistent approach). If I log in as a user with the remember me checked and if I close the browser (Chrome) and reopen and hits the same , The app was redirected to the login screen which shouldn't have been the case. My config xml for spring security had just <security:remember-me> initially. Then later I added <security:remember-me use-secure-cookie="false"/> and it worked like a charm in CHROME. So now if the user logs in with the remember me checked and closes the browser and reopens the browser , then the app is redirected with the logged on user to the home page. But now the same piece of code seems not to work in IE10. And I need it to get done from versions of 9 (IE9 and above). Tried a lot scenarios. But cant get to the root cause. Any help would be appreciated.
I have the following Java classes/interfaces: Under folder ./common: 1. com.xyz.hrdept.common.dao.DatabaseUtilsDAO (interface) 2. com.xyz.hrdept.common.dao.hibernate.DatabaseUtilsDAOHibernate (class, implements the above interface). Under folder ./WebApplication/src 3. com.xyz.hrdept.dao.DAOFactory // abstract class { DatabaseUtilsDAO getDatabaseUtilsDAO(); } 4. com.xyz.hrdept.dao.hibernate.hibernate.HibernateDAOFactory extends DAOFactory { DatabaseUtilsDAO getDatabaseUtilsDAO() { return new DatabaseUtilsDAOHibernate(); } } They compile successfully in my local Intellij environment, but failed on Jenkins server with the following error message: /WebApplication/src/com/xyz/hrdept/dao/hibernate/HibernateDAOFactory.java:70: error: reference to DatabaseUtilsDAO is ambiguous, both interface com.xyz.hrdept.dao.DatabaseUtilsDAO in com.xyz.hrdept.dao and interface com.xyz.hrdept.common.dao.DatabaseUtilsDAO in com.xyz.hrdept.common.dao match There is no com.xyz.hrdept.dao.DatabaseUtilsDAO interface. I do not know how the server assumes that. On Jenkins server, I include to modules to build, one for common, one for WebApplication. I have been spending a lot of time on it, does anybody have a clue and help me out?
I am using waffle 1.7 + spring 4 + spring security 3.2 + thymeleaf. My problem is, that I am unable to provide custom error page when fall-back form logging fails. This is my configuration: @Override protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception { http.authorizeRequests() .antMatchers("/**") .authenticated() .and() .exceptionHandling() .authenticationEntryPoint(negotiateSecurityFilterEntryPoint()) .accessDeniedPage("/access-denied") .and() .addFilterBefore(waffleNegotiateSecurityFilter(), BasicAuthenticationFilter.class); } When user uses browser with SNPENGO off and enters wrong credentials, the default system 500 page appears with following information: com.sun.jna.platform.win32.Win32Exception: The logon attempt failed. waffle.windows.auth.impl.WindowsAuthProviderImpl.acceptSecurityToken(WindowsAuthProviderImpl.java:134) waffle.servlet.spi.NegotiateSecurityFilterProvider.doFilter(NegotiateSecurityFilterProvider.java:103) waffle.servlet.spi.SecurityFilterProviderCollection.doFilter(SecurityFilterProviderCollection.java:130) ... How can I provide my custom page (access-denied.html thymeleaf template) ? So far I have tried everything from http://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc but without success.

I have a project that runs Spring and I am using IntelliJ as the compiler. I started building the project in Ubuntu but I was having problems viewing my database edits so I switched to Windows and lost my Ubuntu partition (due to some other unrelated error). I am trying to reset up my project in Windows but I can't get it to compile properly. I have tried redownloading IntelliJ, restarting my computer, clean installing maven, and searching everywhere for a solution. I found a link on IntelliJ's website but they never actually address a solution to the problem ( http://devnet.jetbrains.com/thread/436515 ). I started to try the unfinished advice to "remove all artifacts selected for deployment from the list and then add them again" but I cannot figure out how to add them again once deleted. Additionally, I keep seeing the error "Configuration Error: deployment source '(projectname): war exploded' is not valid" Any advice or tips to what I could try or am doing wrong would be great. Thanks!
We ran into this error accidentally. Here is how: We had a Lucene search code based on Lucene version 3.6.0 working perfectly fine. The compilation of the code used to be against version 3.6.0. The Lucene related jars which we use, are already there on server, so we do not bundle the Lucene jars with the deployment archive. The runtime refers the jars on the server. Inadvertently, one of the team members compiled the code against Lucene 4.8.1 WITHOUT any code change. When we deployed the code, we got ClassNotFoundError for org/apache/lucene/index/IndexableField. We are pretty sure that we DO NOT refer this class anywhere in our code, directly or indirectly. We searched and made sure of this using multiple tools. We recompiled the code using version 3.6.0 then everything worked fine. The code compiles with 3.6.0 version without any problem. The class IndexableField is only introduced in 4.8.1 version and its not here in any previous version. We are using JDK7 Now the question is: How does the compilation of same source using different library versions affect the generated bytecode ? In our code we never referred to IndexableField, but in the compile code, the reference to IndexableField creeps in when compiled against different version !
everyone! Here's the thing, I've been developing a JavaFX application with JDK 7u17 (That's the one Netbeans is compilling it, anyways) and I haven't had any problem testing it and running it through Netbeans itself. I simply click Run and it goes smoothly. I'm creating the .jar files and the other (html, jnlp) through Clean-Build using Netbeans and the app does open perfectly when I execute the Jar. The problem is when I try to navigate through the App, the app consists of 4 scenes (Login, Main, Search and Create) with me being able to log-in and head to the main scene but that's about it. The buttons to go to the search scene or create scene don't do anything nor I get an error saying something crashed (note I'm not using the console since I don't even know how to make it appear in runtime). I simply click them and they do nothing. As I said earlier, the app runs perfectly when it's ran through Netbeans. Some more info: Netbeans Version: 8.0 Compilling Version through Netbeans: 1.7u17 Existing Java versions on System: 1.8u25, 1.7u67 and 1.7u17 (I already tried enabling only 1.7u17) The App used FXML to switch between Scenes, it works great between LogIn and Main scenes. What could it possibly be that it works great using Netbeans and break outside Netbeans? EDIT #1: According to the console (Thanks to @janih) I'm running Java version 1.7u17, same as Netbeans and it looks like it's working properly. The problem persists when I'm trying to run the same jar by simply doubli clicking it. It stops showing me controls (Third party controls).
Here is my problem: I simply want to see if my_list contains the string it got from letters. At the bottom of the code I use a toast method, and it shows that I have correctly added the string to my_list. But for some reason when I try debugging the program it doesn't add my_list or letters to the variables section. The variable section is empty. And as you can see, I have put tons of breakpoints in the code but the program just runs with breaking. I have been trying to debug this application straight from my phone. I have tried cleaning the project, restarting eclipse, building, changing code but the debugger just won't work. Am I doing something wrong? Anybody know why these variables (my_list and letters) are not added to the variables perspective? Please let me know if I need to provide more code or information.

I'm currently struggling with Java JSON deserialization with Jackson in the following way: I want to process and deserialize a JSON response I get back from a webservice and convert the response into POJOs with the help of Jackson. This works fine most of the time, as long as the response I'm getting contains JSON attributes in the correct format. As however the webservice and the delivered data is out of my control, I can not rely on the data always being in the correct format. Let me give you an example: In my POJO, there's a java.util.Date field, and the JSON response contains a property holding a datetime string. Jackson will try to parse the string and convert it into a Date. If the date format matches the ObjectMapper's dateformat (ObjectMapper.setDateFormat(...)), everything is fine. If the format is different, I get an InvalidFormatException. The problem now is, the dateformat sent from the service can differ. I can get dates formatted like 2014-11-02T00:00:00Z, but I can also get dates formatted like 2014-11 (identifying just a single month instead of an entire datetime). I know, I can write a custom deserializer which could take care of this exact case and handle datestrings with different date formats correctly. But as this would only fix issues with Dates, but not with potential other datatypes, I'm searching for a more general approach. (What happens e.g. if I expect a Double and receive an alphanumerical string?) What I would like is to have the possibility to ignore all cases in which an InvalidFormatException happens and define a default value (like null) to the respective POJO field. And it would be really valuable for me, if despite an invalid dateformat being returned or any other InvalidFormatException happening, the rest of the JSON would still be deserialized into the POJO. Is this in any way possible with Jackson? Thank you for reading my question till the end and I would be grateful for any pointers in the right direction.

Alchemy API is used in my program for extracting keywords and relations from a URL. When extracting these from the API calls I'm getting the error as follows, 'java.io.IOException: Error making API call: cannot-retrieve:downstream-http-error:404. at com.alchemyapi.api.AlchemyAPI.doRequest(AlchemyAPI.java:960) at com.alchemyapi.api.AlchemyAPI.GET(AlchemyAPI.java:914) at com.alchemyapi.api.AlchemyAPI.URLGetRankedKeywords(AlchemyAPI.java:234) at com.alchemyapi.api.AlchemyAPI.URLGetRankedKeywords(AlchemyAPI.java:224) at innointel.feature1.Article.alchemyCall(Article.java:477)' Then I found "http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/22/microsoft-and-ibm-partner-to-bring-enterprise-software-to-their-respective-cloud-platforms/" was the URL causing the error.I called the relation API simply putting the URL as follows .. Document doc = alchemyObj.URLGetRelations("http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/22/microsoft-and-ibm-partner-to-bring-enterprise-software-to-their-respective-cloud-platforms/"); Well now, it contains no error . What is actually happening here ?? I found in some websites that "cannot-retrieve:downstream-http-error:404" is due to the invalid URL passed as argument. Out Of 50 URL i tested 7 URL shows the error.Remaining works fine.And again when i extract the URL string placed it as a argument 7 URL works fine too.. (URL is parsed from an excel document using POI API) Thanks in advance
On my webapp, I often get the following exception: java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Could not send query: Last packet not finished it usually happens after a long period of time the system is idle. A restart to the tomcat solves the issue temporarily. I've recently moved to RHEL7 on my production server (running tomcat7 and mariaDB 5.5). This error hadn't not happened on the old server (ran RHEL5 with mySQL). I updated the java database drivers from mysql drivers that were used on the old server, to the latest stable mariadb connector: mariadb-java-client-1.1.7.jar. Any ideas how to fix the problem or a workaround?

I am wanting to create a Grails application with a number of java source files. These java files are to give me access to an embedded Neo4J graph by means of spring-data-neo4j. (I would use the Grails Neo4J GORM plugin instead, but for the fact that it doesn't work in anything higher than Grails 2.3.5 - I'm using 2.4.3 - and even when using 2.3.5, the sample application provided by the developer has errors when I run it). I want to create a series of java classes that represent the nodes that are present in the graph, which spring-data-neo4j will then allow me to access in Grails as POJOs (as discussed in point 1 of the second answer on SO here). I am using this Spring Data tutorial here as a starting point. I've copied the Person.java and PersonRepository.java classes to src/java. I'm then running "grails run-app" - I don't expect anything to happen, just for Grails to compile the java sources and then start normally (I'll then work on importing some of the code in Application.java into a 3rd java class to actually use the classes). However, I get the following error and Grails crashes: context.ContextLoader Context initialization failed java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.springframework.expression.spel.SpelParserConfiguration.(Lorg/springframework/expression/spel/SpelCompilerMode;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) context.GrailsContextLoaderListener Error initializing the application: org.springframework.expression.spel.SpelParserConfiguration.(Lorg/springframework/expression/spel/SpelCompilerMode;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.springframework.expression.spel.SpelParserConfiguration.(Lorg/springframework/expression/spel/SpelCompilerMode;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) | Error Forked Grails VM exited with error | Server running. Browse to http://localhost:8080/ If I run the java example application as a basic java program (build and run it using "gradle run") then it works as advertised. Is there something I need to do to get java code to compile properly inside a Grails spring data application?
I have set the environment variable (windows) for MAVEN_OPTS, including references to my keystore, truststore etc, and when I build my maven project from the command line it works without any issues. My problem is that Eclipse doesn't seem to be picking up MAVEN_OPTS as it won't build the same project. Which I could resolve by adding explicitly the MAVEN_OPTS parameters to the Maven goal within eclipse. But this doesn't solve my Eclipse project showing as having errors by (I assume) a Maven plugin in Eclipse. This is the error: ArtifactDescriptorException: Failed to read artifact descriptor for antlr:antlr:jar:2.7.6: ArtifactResolutionException: Could not transfer artifact antlr:antlr:pom:2.7.6 from/to internal-repository (https://"hostname"/artifactory/repo): java.net.ConnectException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure to https://"hostname"/artifactory/repo/antlr/antlr/2.7.6/antlr-2.7.6.pom Where I have replaced the actual hostname for "hostname" for the purposes of this question. Could someone please help me fix this problem as I would like to have Eclipse showing without any errors. Thanks! Edit: I have updated maven to the latest version 3.0.4 and the issue remains but with a different error: Could not transfer artifact org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:pom:2.4 from/to internal-repository (https://"hostname"/artifactory/repo): sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target Update: I can now build by adding the remote repository certificate to the default java keystore but I can't get rid of the problems shown on my eclipse projects. I have tried adding the MAVEN OPTS parameters to eclipse.ini without any luck.

I have a requirement to display an error page in my JSF application when certain HTTP errors or Java exceptions are encountered and provide the user with a form on the error page which they can use to report the error as a possible bug. At the same time I need ensure that the error page is only displayed in response to a real application error and not as a result of the user accessing the error page directly by typing in the URL and potentially submitting spurious bug reports. I have tried locating the error pages in WEB-INF which prevents the user from accessing the page directly, however the HTTP post method on the form fails when the user tries to submit the bug report. A quick search on StackOverflow shows that there are several similar questions, however none of them relate to the use case I am trying to meet. The closest question I have found is How to detect whether user have reached a page by JSF navigation rule redirect or by typing the URL? which suggests checking the referer request header but says that overzealous proxy/firewall/security software can hide the referer header so I don't believe this is the correct solution for this requirement. In summary my question is.... What is the best way to ensure that an error page which contains a form is only displayed when a real application error has occurred and not due to the user typing in the URL? Note: This question is following on from another question (Is it possible to submit a form that has been rendered from a JSF page location in WEB-INF?) I asked on StackOverflow but I didn't get any answers, so I'm hoping that by not constraining the question as I did previously I might get some responses.
I've already tried everything I saw in the forum but it seems that doesn't work for me. I really need to finish this project until Nov. 25th but I'm stuck at the creation of the project. Eclipse is full of errors, like this: [2014-11-05 20:59:48 - TEXApp] D:\workspace\appcompat_v7\res\values-v21\themes_base.xml:190: error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name: attr 'android:colorPrimary'.

There's a lot of them, I don't know what's wrong since I installed all the libraries. Here's how I set up the project: http://i.imgur.com/Ps6JtBU.png And this is what I get: http://i.imgur.com/XhMSWo1.png Some times I delete the components which have errors, but I still get the themes_base.xml errors and my R.java is not generated. Sorry for the long text but, I don't know what to do, hope you can help me, thanks!
I have a java app that uses javax mail to send emails through amazons SES. I send mail over smtp port 25 and haven't made any code changes to my email class in nearly a year. It has worked fine without issue until today. Now it appears to be timing out my application and occasionally sending an email. I'm seeing 100's of lines of the following in the log, not really sure what it means. 2014-11-06 19:20:11,320 [INFO] command processing is alive. 2014-11-06 19:20:11,320 [DEBUG] Receiving messages for queue https://queue.amazonaws.com/xxx 2014-11-06 19:20:31,391 [DEBUG] Receiving messages for queue https://queue.amazonaws.com/xxx 2014-11-06 19:20:51,461 [DEBUG] Receiving messages for queue https://queue.amazonaws.com/xxx 2014-11-06 19:21:11,531 [DEBUG] Receiving messages for queue https://queue.amazonaws.com/xxx 2014-11-06 19:21:31,608 [DEBUG] Receiving messages for queue https://queue.amazonaws.com/xxx At one point it appeared as if I was having a connection issue. The only thing I can think of is the fact I'm now using https, however I've been using it for nearly 2 weeks without issue. Does anybody know why all of a sudden his would become an issue?
Im am trying to learn and also adapt the ImageNeuralNetwork example in Java. So far my problem is that when i give the NN a larger amount of images that are 32X32 and let it train the error never goes down below 14% and at the beginning it jumps all over the place. My images are BW and they are classified into 27 classes. so i know that there are 27 output neurons. My question is why is the NN not learning, I tried setting different hidden layers ( 1 or 2 layers) with different neuron counts but nothing helps. Can anyone give me an idea of what im doing wrong? Like i said im just beginning with NNs and im a bit lost here Edit: It seems if i give it less images as input to learn the error goes down, but that doesnt really solve the problem, If i wanted to classify a lot of images i would be stuck with the error never going down
I have an annoying issue with a commercial Java-based program I use. The program is a trading workstation (TWS, Interactive Brokers). When I minimize the program window to the Windows (7) taskbar, the application no longer transmits a feed of information to a custom application I have written (compiled C++) that connects with (TWS) via a socket. The TWS program does not crash when minimized, and when I restore the window the data feed to my app resumes. The problem is not intermittent- the data feed stops the instant the window is minimized, and resumes the instant it is restored, every time. I can focus on other windows and not lose the feed- it is specific to minimization. And my app does not "disconnect" with the TWS- the app generates error messages related to loss of the market data feed but does not ever claim to be disconnected, something it would know instantly. I've gone thru every config in the program TWS. I've also spoken with IB and, surprisingly, the person there could not help me. I googled search terms around this problem and I did find one guy who had a problem with his iTunes playback skipping when the iTunes window was minimized. Are there any settings at the level of the CPU/OS or Java that I can try here? My PC is capable and has a quad-core CPU, so Affinity would not appear to matter/help.
My project is basically a Communication client like lync which is developed in JAVA for front end (GUI) and uses platform specific native (C or C++) code for running services. Now, on Linux, (Ubuntu 12.04), once the JAR application is invoked, it loads all the native code shared libraries and the UI thread starts executing. Any action done in the UI will throw an event to the native code which is in C. So currently i need to debug a crash in a C/C++ user library which is triggered when i do something in a UI drop down. I am using GDB, to attach to the PID of the process , (sudo gdb -p ), all the symbols are loaded and i am able to set a breakpoint to a function say A() in the library.After continue command in GDB, i select the instance from UI Dropdown and breakpoint is hit at Function A(). At this moment, my ubuntu machine hangs and no keyboard interrupts are working. I am only able to move my mouse pointer but cannot click on anything. However, to verify that kernel is not down, i can ping the machine and even SSH is possible. Once the same GDB is invoked by SSH the above problem is not encountered. May anyone please help me out here as to why UI or X11 process hangs during the above scenario. PS: Yes there are lot of threads running, it might be a thread deadlock situation but it does not happen when GDB is invoked by SSH terminal. Thanks and Regards, Indra

We are running a tomcat server with connection pooling and have recently been getting this error randomly. It happens when we go to run a stored procedure in a package randomly. I have tried to do some research into the problem myself, which lead to the source of this Java class which is where I assume the error is being dumped from: http://ora-jdbc-source.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/OracleJDBC/src/oracle/jdbc/driver/T2CCallableStatement.java My question is: What is accessor type number 9? It's not defined in the example class I provided, but whoever wrote that class obviously had to have a list of accessors and their corresponding numbers, of which I would like to see if possible, but have been unable to find. I also have found other accessor type numbers in the error logs, for example: 6 has shown up also. Update: I found a page detailing the datatypes and their code values, but datatype 6 and 9 apparently don't exist, making this error even weirder: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e10646/oci03typ.htm#LNOCI030
I have a program that connects through JDBC to an oracle database and extracts 3+ Million records. If I load everything into memory I am getting an out of memory error.

There is two ways that I am approaching the issue: a) Keep the connection open and process the data into groups of 50 0000 as they come from the result set. I do not really like this approach because there could be a risk of leaving the connection open when everything is done and also the connection could be open for a long time (risking timeouts and decreasing connections pool) as each group of 50 000 records is being processed (and by being processed I mean each of these could cause other connections to open and close quickly based on the derived data that may be needed) b) Process based on row numbers but I am not sure what the impact might be if the underplaying data changes and also I cannot really afford to do a sort every time I process 50 000 records. This seems to be a common problem and I would like to know what are some industry standards/ best approaches/ design patterns to this issue.
When I want to export my Android app from Eclipse, the export process starts normally but after a few seconds (when the whole process should actually take a minute) it fails. The following error message appears: Failed to export application That's all Eclipse is telling me. I'm using Ecliipse 4.4.1 with the Android Development Toolkit 23.0.4.1468518. When I then right-click the app, choose "Android Tools" and then "Export Unsigned Application Package", it fails again, but with more verbose error messages: As you can see, it says: 'Android Release Export' has encountered a problem. Failed to export application And strangely, it lists a file bin/$1$1.class which apparently cannot be found. There's no obvious reason why this file shouldn't be found, however. Only when I delete folders bin and gen and then clear the project, it works. But only once -- and after every successful run on the device or export to an APK, I have to repeat the step described before. Any ideas why this happens? Thanks a lot in advance!
We are using MQ JMS standalone client application (NO app server) to consume WebSphere MQ messages. Our Queue definition is as follows: APP_QUEUE1 - (QA, PUT enabled) APP_QUEUE1.CL - (QL and target of above APP_QUEUE1) APP_QUEUE1_BOQ - (QA and BOQNAME of APP_QUEUE1.CL, PUT enabled) APP_QUEUE1_BOQ.CL - (QL and target of above APP_QUEUE1_BOQ ) BOTHERH of APP_QUEUE1 = 3. With above set up, when exception occurs for the first time, I am getting exception saying backout queue is not defined and attempt to add to dead letter queue also fails. Can someone explain why message is not getting recede to main queue (APP_QUEUE1) even though BOTHRESH is 3. My understanding is, in case of exception, message will be recede to APP_QUEUE1 3 times and after that it will be routed to back out queue. If back out queue is full or fails then only message is added to dead letter queue. Can someone please answer if there's anything wrong with queue definition ? Or something needs to be done in the application code ?
In my android application the onDestroy method on the Activity is never called before the application runs out of memory. I can call finish() on the onStop() method of the activity and will never run out of memory, however then I lose the back button functionality. Sorry I can't be any more specific about the issue. Everything I have read is that android is supposed to call the onDestroy() and finish() when resources get low however this is never called. I would like the activities at the bottom of the stack to have finish() called on them. They aren't and I eventually run out of memory. I call: adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.mypackage And I see the activity count always incrementing until the OutOfMemoryError. If I call finish() on the activities at onStop() then the activity count will stay around 30 and no OOME. Thanks for any advice. Memory management on android is a disaster, thanks for tips you have.

I have got few queries regarding switch over, fail over and auto reconnect in multi instance MQ. while going through IBM Documentation on this. Scenarios Switch Over: Using endmqm -s <QMGR> Fail Over : Bringing down the server on which active instance is running. Application : I am running a stand alone Java program which puts messages in the queue. Questions: Is there any difference the way MQ handles the switch over and fail over? From the document I could see, in both the cases locks gets released. Is reconnect happens automatically if the active instance goes down either by switch over or fail over? I have observed while putting the messages through my stand alone application, the moment I fired up the command endmqm -s <QMGR> in active instance, my application crashes with com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedJMSException: JMSWMQ2007: Failed to send a message to destination 'MYQ'. JMS attempted to perform an MQPUT or MQPUT1; however WebSphere MQ reported an error. Use the linked exception to determine the cause of this error. But If i restart my application it is connecting to the stand by server (Active after endmqm -s ) and successfully putting the messages. Is there any way to perform automatic re connection? If yes, is there any configuration available from MQ or it needs to be done from application level. I have seen in the document it is mentioned Automatic client reconnect is not supported by WebSphere® MQ classes for Java. What does this means? So far I am using plain Java code to test the Multi Instance feature. I want to try the same with Spring DMLC. Is multi instance behavior supported with Spring DMLC? If yes, is there any extra configuration/set up required? Any guidance is much appreciated.
I am new to Hadoop and am following the book Hadoop: The Definitive Guide. I have installed Hadoop on my mac, which seems to have worked fine. I have set up a basic file system in HDFS (/user/nick). But I can't get the 'hadoop' command to execute a class file as required in Chapter 3 (p 56). It doesn't seem to be the file because the 'hadoop'command won't open even a simple file where where java command works fine. This is what my terminal looks like for the simple file: Unix ~/Desktop $ java TestJava Hello Test World Unix ~/Desktop $ hadoop TestJava Error: Could not find or load main class TestJava All the other hadoop commands I have tried work fine (hadoop -ls, hadoop -copyFromLocal, hadoop -mkdir etc), but hadoop CLASSNAME doesn't work when the class file is saved on the desktop. I always get Error: Could not find or load main class TestJava. Am I saving the class file in the wrong place or have I set up hadoop wrong? I am new to this and have searched for an answer but couldn't find a solution. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks, Nick
So I'm trying to use BufferedReader to read in words from a txt file containing about 250k words. When I create a BufferedReader object and try to pass it a File, android studio tells me there is an unhandled exception (FileNotFoundException). I solved this by wrapping it in a try catch statement however I was wondering if I could have added a throws FileNotFoundException clause next to my class declaration like i do sometimes when im writing a program outside of android (just java no android). Eclipse highlights the error and when you click it it gives you the option to add throws clause. I searched for similar questions and i read that the analogous feature with IntelliJ is to hold mouse cursor over the underlined error and press alt + enter, it gives you the option to either wrap in try catch or add a throws clause. Im using android studio on a mac, not Intellij, and when i did this it didn't give me any such option. Am I using the correct shortcut for android studio/mac/Intellij?? Is it not allowing me to add a throws clause because it extends Activity already? Any help would be appreciated. This doesn't work: http://gyazo.com/e5d8d87f3030d8628bee403f4cbf37ce What I get when i press alt+enter over the error: http://gyazo.com/b89fc7f8f4c311f64f6fb2d98b68b96a

I have some JavaCV code that works on windows and I'm trying to get it to work on Ubuntu. All of the image processing is working fine, but I can't get any video to work. When I call cvCreateFileCapture on Ubuntu it always returns null. I can verify the file is present (java.io.File.exists returns true on the line before), so I assume this is a codec problem. However, I have tried using video files with MPEG-2, H.264, AVI, and basic mjpeg encodings and get the same result for all of them. The same code works fine on my windows machine. My question is what are the next debugging steps to figure out my problem. Randomly trying further codecs doesn't seem productive. Is there some way to figure out which codecs are available and why they are not getting selected? It is picking up the opencv libraries by having opencv-linux-x86_64.jar and ffmpeg-linux-x86_64.jar in the path.

I'm running GlassFish 3.1.2 behind Apache 2.4.10 web server and mod_jk on CentOS 6 Linux server. I've observed PCI Compliance scans consistently create errors in the GlassFish server.log file, which cause my web app running in GlassFish to become unavailable (file not found). Basically, the web app dies, but the domain continues to run, although it continuously generates errors from that point forward. Could anyone confirm this is known behavior? If so, are there any known workarounds? Or, is the only solution to bring my application down for the 1-2 days it takes to run the PCI Compliance scan? Here are typical errors/warning I see when running such scans (these from GlassFish's server.log file):

On our production application we recently become weird error from DB2: Caused by: com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException: [jcc][t4][2055][11259][4.13.80] The database manager is not able to accept new requests, has terminated all requests in progress, or has terminated your particular request due to an error or a force interrupt. ERRORCODE=-4499, SQLSTATE=58009 This occurs when hibernate tries to select data from one big table(More than 6 milions records and 320 columns). I observed that when ResultSet lower that 10 elements, hibernate selects successfully. Our architecture: Spring 4.0.3 Hibernate 4.3.5 DB2 v10 z/Os Websphere 7.0.0.31(with JDBC V9.7FP5) This select works when I tried to executed this in Data Studio or when app is started localy from Tomcat(connected to production Data Source). I suppose that Data Source on Websphere is not corectly configured, but I tried some modifications and without results. I also tried to update JDBC Driver but that not helped. Actually I become then ERRORCODE = -1244. Ok, so now I'm looking for any help ;). I can obviously provide additional information when needed. Maybe someone fighted earlier with this problem? Thanks in advance!
I am getting the typical "R cannot be resolved to a variable error" but I have currently tried what I feel to be almost every "fix" and I still can't get it to work. I think it has to do with the many errors I am getting from the res folder: res\values\styles.xml:7: error: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'Theme.AppCompat.Light'. res\values-v11\styles.xml:7: error: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'Theme.AppCompat.Light'. res\values-v14\styles.xml:8: error: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar'. and the many other similar errors that are to do with the xml files in the appcombat_v7 folder. I have tried cleaning the project, building the project, I have updated my android sdk tools and ADT for eclipse to the newest version, I am using android 4.4 for the target of the project. any help would be nice EDIT: Also get this error: WARNING: unable to write jarlist cache file H:\Workspace\appcompat_v7\bin\jarlist.cache And this on the activity_main.xml in the layout folder: The project target (Android 5.0) was not properly loaded.
I am just learning Java and have a question on calls from an XPage to a JavaBean. I am working on a JavaBean I got from Declan Sciolla-Lynch's blog that works perfectly in most situations. The link points to the example code. Essentially the JavaBean connects into the names.nsf and pulls various fields for lookup. IE User's phone or email address. Similar to an existing LotusScript class we had implemented in the past. We have a secondary Directory with additional information that I took Declan's example and modified it. It now points to a different server, nsf and has additional fields. It works under normal conditions. However I have run into to two issues that cause the class to fail and to show an unhelpful "Can't Instantiate Class" error. The issues were with the ACL and database replication formula and will be resolved but I'd like to try to minimize environmentally caused issues. The problem is I can't trap this in EL or SSJS because it is happening at a JavaBean/class level. There is a try{} catch {} around the Java code but the "Can't Instantiate Class" error still occurs. I am attempting to load the default values of three fields on an XPage with SSJS calls to the JavaBean. Is there a way to capture the error in the JavaBean and pass it to the XPages so that I can test for a loaded class before calling the managed bean?
I have a heavy java web application that has a module which needs to be run as soon as computer starts and 24X7. That module has a bat file to execute which fetches data from server. I want to run that bat file as a windows service on my system (OS: Windows 7) I created service with sc create command which successfully created. But when I try to start it, it always give error 1053 i.e. can't start service ; service does not respond correctly or in timely manner. I followed all the related threads on stack overflow and others as well but no luck.For eg., I set servicesPipeTimeout also but it doesn't work. Is there a way in java itself to create windows service? I do not want to use any third party like wrapper, NSSM etc or Time Scheduler either. Please provide me some clues if anybody faced this error and get it resolved. Thanks in advance.The time you give means a lot to me. Thanks a lot
I have just switched from Windows7 to Windows8.1 and I'm having trouble making Android Studio work now. I have installed Android Studio and the JDK. First I tried it out with the latest versions Android Studio v.0.8.14 and JDK 1.8, but I could not get it to work. I then tried to use the versions I used on my previous Windows7, and installed Android Studio 0.8.2 and JDK 1.7.0_67, but I still can't get it to work. The error I'm getting is: Failed to load JVM DLL C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_67\jre. If you already have a 64-bit JDK installed, define JAVA_HOME variable in Computer > System Properties > System Settings > Environment Variables I have set JAVA_HOME to my JDK path. I've tried to add \bin to that path, which didn't help. I've tried to add the JDK_HOME variable and set path to it, which didn't help either. I have also added "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_67\" to my PATH variable, which also didn't help. I tried editing studio.bat adding a string to point to my JDK folder, which also didn't work. When I check my Java from console (cmd) I get the msg that it works find: C:\Users\Igor>java -version java version "1.7.0_67" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_67-b01) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.65-b04, mixed mode) Is Windows 8.1 the problem? Do I have to do something different on it?
I recently updated a Play v1 app to use OpenJDK v1.8 on Heroku and am finding that after typical load I start getting R14 errors relatively quickly - the physical memory has exceeded the 512MB limit and is now swapping impacting performance. I need to restart the applications frequently to stop the R14 errors. The application is a very typical web application and I would expect it to run comfortably within the memory constraints. Here is a screenshot from NewRelic showing the physical memory being exceeded. I don't really have 59 JVMs, just the result of numerous restarts. I don't quite understand why the "used heap" appears to impact the "physical memory" when it hasn't come close to the "committed heap" and why the "physical memory" seems to more closely follow the "used heap" rather than the "committed heap" I've used the Eclipse Memory Analyzer to analyse some heap dumps and the Leak Suspects report mentions play.Play and play.mvc.Router as suspects though I'm not sure if that's expected and/or if they are directly related to the physical memory being exceeded. See the generated by MAT for more details. Leak Suspects Top Components Any guidance on how to resolve this would be great. I'm developing on OS X with Oracle Java 1.8 and have not yet been able to replicate the exact Heroku dyno environment locally (e.g. Ubuntu, OpenJDK 1.8) to attempt to reproduce the issue. UPDATE 11/12/2014: Here is the response from Heroku Support: Play, and in turn Netty, allocate direct memory ByteBuffer objects for IO. Because they use direct memory, they will not be reported by the JVM (Netty 4.x now uses ByteBuf objects, which use heap memory). The 65MB of anonymous maps that your app is using is not terribly uncommon (I’ve seen some use 100+mb). Some solutions include: Limiting the concurrent of your application (possibly by setting play.pool) Increase your dyno size to a 2X dyno. Decrease your Xmx setting to 256m. This will give the JVM more room for non-heap allocation. Please let us know if these solutions do not work for you, or if you continue to experience problems after adopting them. If you want to reproduce the Heroku environment locally, I recommend installing Docker, and using this Docker image with your application. Let us know if you have any trouble with this.
I am using Eclipse's BIRT to render a report through Java using org.eclipse.birt.runtime version 4.4.0. When attempting to render the report, BIRT is returning: org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.core.DataException: Invalid Javascript expression: dataSetRow["name"]. (and similar errors for each dataSetRow and row) in .getErrors() of the IRunAndRenderTask; The template works fine using the BIRT designer and rendering it through that application, but it breaks when trying to render using Java. I've done extensive searching throughout the web, and many people have suggested the presence of conflicting js.jar present in the application. This is not the case in the application I'm working on. The only javascript/rhino instances are those being imported through BIRT. I've also attempted the following solutions: Excluding the bundled javascript and importing latest Rhino/javascript from Mozilla Updating BIRT to 4.4.1 and creating a report template with the latest BIRT designer Degrading the report template to only show one value returned by the DB (in this case 'name' of a dealership) This project is using Maven, and is running in Tomcat 7 - using Java 6. The database is using mysql. More details can be provided if requested. EDIT: Been fiddling around with this problem for a little bit and have found the following: Basic reports that do not hit the database render fine - even javascript expressions Once I attempt to get datasets out of a query, then the Invalid Javascript expression gets thrown, for e.g. in this section of the template: <data id="624"> <property name="dataSet">Dealership</property> <list-property name="boundDataColumns"> <structure> <property name="name">name</property> <text-property name="displayName">name</text-property> <expression name="expression" type="javascript">dataSetRow["name"]</expression> <property name="dataType">string</property> </structure> </list-property> <property name="resultSetColumn">name</property> </data> Any value placed in the above datasetRow section throws an Invalid Javascript error
Background I'm working on an Android app that controls the screen rotation. The app is available on the Google Play store. To control the screen rotation, the app disables system auto rotation and changes the values of USER_ROTATION. The source code is available via Mercurial/hg. Problem While the app works fine on my phone, a rooted Sony Xperia M, it crashes on a friend's Samsung Galaxy S3 running Android 4.3. The crash occurs outside of my code, so I don't get a crash report in the Google Play Store, and the stack trace only shows external code that I don't have access to. java.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: get/set setting for user asks to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0; this requires android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:1431) at android.database.DatabaseUtils.readExceptionFromParcel(DatabaseUtils.java:185) at android.database.DatabaseUtils.readExceptionFromParcel(DatabaseUtils.java:137) at android.content.ContentProviderProxy.call(ContentProviderNative.java:602) at android.provider.Settings$NameValueCache.getStringForUser(Settings.java:934) at android.provider.Settings$System.getStringForUser(Settings.java:1162) at android.provider.Settings$System.getIntForUser(Settings.java:1232) at com.android.internal.policy.impl.WindowOrientationListener$ScreenOrientationEventListenerImpl.onSensorChanged(WindowOrientationListener.java:501) at android.hardware.SystemSensorManager$SensorE This stack trace implies that the system auto rotation is still running. It also shows the OS code is trying to read an int system setting as a particular user after receiving a screen orientation change event. So I suspect the problem is related to me disabling ACCELEROMETER_ROTATION or changing USER_ROTATION, both of which are int system settings. Troubleshooting I checked other questions about this error. Most of them only explain what the error means without providing any solution. I couldn't find any with the exact same call stack trace. I checked the AOSP code for WindowOrientationListener, but it doesn't contain the inner class in which the error occurs, ScreenOrientationEventListenerImpl. The Samsung phone probably uses a custom version of the code, most likely in part because it has a non-AOSP feature, Smart Rotation. I don't think my code is doing any user-specific stuff; it's just using normal Android APIs. I tested the app on a non-rooted Sony Xperia M and a Sony Xperia Ray, and it was fine on them. I tested the app on 4 different Samsung Galaxy S3s using Samsung Remote Test Lab. I tried to find the source code where the error is occurring. I found a smali file, which at a glance indicates that it's trying to read the setting "intelligent_rotation_mode" as user -0x2, which is interesting since I'm not touching that presumably-Samsung-specific setting. I also downloaded a copy of the official source code, but it didn't seem to contain the relevant file.

I am just getting started trying to run a very simple applet in a web page and for some reason I can not get any result. Things I currently know: Running on Windows 8.1. Attempted to use both Chrome (preferred) and IE. I do have Java enabled in my browser settings. The applet does run when executed in Eclipse (Luna). It is nothing more than a simple "Hello World" type applet. I am not using the "applet" tag in my HTML. I am using the "object" tag. I am using the simplest settings for the tag. I am using the latest version of Java. I have tried turning off Ad blockers. My security settings are set to allow me to run this one webpage locally for my testing purposes (ie it is on the "allowed" list). I am getting no error messages of any kind, I am simply not seeing my applet in the web page. I have looked around here and other sources and all the solutions I have found have been something related to the above but none seem to be working for me at this time. Thoughts?
I'm trying to build a google app engine application using java and eclipse which makes use of an external library. I have been having some issues with serializing a particular class which I need to save, so I downloaded the source for the library and added it as its own project in eclipse and linked the project I'm working on to it as well as a test application(standard java app). To solve my issue I set the class I need to serialize to implement serializable, and this is where the weird behavior starts. From the test application, with this change, I am now able to serialize the class to a binary array, yet in the app engine project I keep getting a class not serializable error. To get round this I implemented the serializing method as part of the class I need to serialize. Once again this works well from the test project, but when I try to run it from the app engine project (copy and pasting the code to make sure there are no changes), I am getting a "java.lang.NoSuchMethodError" error. It is also worth noting that the ide itself does not show any errors in the code. Anyone ever ran into something similar and has a clue what to do, as I honestly have no idea what to check, and I can't seem to find any solutions to such an issue. Thanks in advance for any help.
i am trying to make my first demo app which communicates with remote server. i have a php project setup on localhost and trying a access a php page from android app. when i try to run and access the page i get the error "connection refused" by the app and it stops running. to access the page i am passing "my_ip_address/folder_name/file_name.php" as url . when i give the same link in browser i get the desired data but not in case when i try to connect it through mobile app. i am running the app on my own android mobile . i have found some same questions but unfortunately because of low points couldn't paste my question to that thread. I also tried out giving the url as "10.0.2.2:8080/folder_name/file_name.php" but it didn't help. i have also updated the manifest file to access the internet. the other solution i found is "my_ip/folder_name/file_name.php" which i am already trying. it wll be great if anyone could help me here. Thanks for your help in advance !

Recently I have upgraded the tomcat version from 7.0.26 to 7.0.54, and now I am facing 404 error with tomcat 7.0.54 version. I have tested with most of the version, till tomcat 7.0.53 my product help link works fine. I am not sure what change had made in 7.0.54 version. Actual Issue: We have simple main_help.war file which is integrated in my product and on click on help link it launches new tab and shows html page runs on java. This is the actual URL - https://hostname.com:8444/main_help/help_services/html/admin_en_usa/index.htm?URL=admin_1_0_0/help_wrapper_topic.html&SHOWTOC=1&CHROME=false with no change in our product and just updated tomcat to 7.0.54 version, the URL is not coming properly. main_help (which is the main war deployed in server (main_help.war)) string is missing in the URL. This is the URL after upgraded to tomcat 7.0.54 - https://hostname.com:8444//help_services/html/admin_en_usa/index.htm?URL=admin_1_0_0/help_wrapper_topic.html&SHOWTOC=1&CHROME=false OS Detail: - Windows 7 64bit. - Java 7 - All browser type (same issue) Could someone please help me what is the change that Apache made? And how can I modify my application accordingly. Regards Thiru

I looked this up everywhere already but I failed to find something for my case. What I found was all about this error occurring with some of the Java libraries. On the contrary, my exception is about my own classes. I had a nice project, which I downloaded complete as part of an assignment. It was working fine, of course. It is an OS project which needs to use a class to load a kernel. I didn't modify any of these files - but suddenly it is NOT working anymore, it throws the error when trying to find one of the classes needed. The class is of course still there. The only thing I did was update at some point to JDK 8, so my first thought was to uninstall. Nothing. Clueless, I system restored (yeah I'm very desperate to fix this quickly). Nothing again. No clue how to fix this. By the way, I use Eclipse. Anyone has an idea? Thanks in advance.
I have a big trouble that i must solve as possible as fast.I did an eclipse project for my friend who uses windows .I sent him eclipse workspace and a jar file.However when he open the jar,he faces errors that i do not have.Program works on mac perfectly fine.Whats the problem?We tried it with three windows computers each of them had the same problem..Thank you. Mostly problems are in my scanners.my strScan object gives error with scan.next() .I think that its about writing txt wrong but error is still there when i solve this problem.Also as you know we are able to select only one item from JList.However in windows they can select as many as they want.Another problem is that.In my Jpanel there is a delete button.When user click on the button it creates a new jframe and add butons and labels on it.When user click that button new frame opens but when we drag mouse on labels texts disappear!(I have add and change buttons that works) My workspace for those who need to see code http://s3.dosya.tc/server29/sXDosP/ZuccaciyeProgrami.zip.html

Here is what I am seeing in my debug view. The second picture I want to examine the state of all the local variables so I can understand why a UnsupportedAudioFileException is being thrown. The first picture looks fine (all the values of the local variables are shown in the variables view). However the second picture, after i step into AudioSystem.getAudioInputstream only shows one local variable, arg0, that I don't even know where that name came from. What happened to the other local variables - providers, audiostream, file ? I looked at possible other threads. No variables shown in eclipse debugging couldn't be my issue because I set a valid breakpoint inside AudioSystem.getAudioInputstream I don't think my issue is this either Locally declared variables can not be inspected because this class didn't ship with the JDK (got it from an external source) Does anyone know how to show the correct local variables?
I am new to zookeeper, Apache curator and need your help to design a prorgram: I need to create a java program, that will run a script every hour (based on cron expression provided by end user). Consider I have 3 servers, I need to make sure the script runs every hour without failure even in case of a server is down (in this case script must run on other server). Every hour script will be running only on one server. I have to create an interface to provide input the this java program. Input will be (i) Script to be run and (ii) Cron expression to schedule script. 1) Please suggest an idea how can I design my program to achieve this. How zookeeper, Apache curator can be used in the same. 2) Is there any way to cache the script on these 3 servers that end-user provide to run? Can Apache curator's NodeCache be used to cache the script on these 3 servers? Your response will be highly appreciated.
So I have been doing a bit of looking but couldn't really find anything that answered my question. In my main method, I have a loop of strings that are going to be run into a method where after it will query 10-12 different tables based of off this string. I currently have the queries surrounded in try catch blocks to catch exceptions. What I want to happen is if there is a timeout or some other sql exception for the program to write to a log (which I have done already) and then return to the main method from any of the other methods it may be in, and go on to the next string in the loop. I don't know a lot about throwing exceptions that are caught farther up, so I though maybe that's what I need to do, but I couldn't find anywhere if I throw an exception if it runs up to where it is caught or what happens exactly with it. Do I just need to throw the exception in the query methods and surround the method call in the main method with a try catch block? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks
I have a problem with JDBC-ODBC connection. There are 60 PCs with Win - 7 64bit, MS Office 2010 32bit, JRE java version 1.7.0_55 and higher and all of them 64bit. I have developed some program and installed on these 60 machines. Pgogram developed in Java and No Web-based, just GUI program. The program works fine on all these machines excepting 2 PCs. When start the program and program tries to connect to MS Access 2010 32bit Database via JDBC-ODBC connection bellow screen shot error appears. http://www.freeuploadimages.org/images/ausvbpdk1oovzjubk2h.jpg After that I have re-installed one of the PCs with the same Win7, office 32 bit and program works fine. I have done with second one too but program on that PC still doesn't want to work and above error appears. Please see below how i start jar file for connection to 32Bit MS Access: start "CallListGUI startup" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe" -D32 -jar "C:\SafetyInspectionRegister\SafetyInspectonRegister.jar" -Dfile.encoding=cp1251 -reuseview %* Can someone help me with this issue please?
I have an java web-project where ejb's (3.1) are configured. When I add (add projects) the ear-project to the local websphere aplication server v8.0 (in eclipse) and start the server I receive the following error: Error while processing references for EJB-in-WAR: com.ibm.ejs.container.EJBConfigurationException: The bean class "nl.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.GebruikerFacade" for EJB "xx-xx-ear#xx-xx-web.war#GebruikerFacade" is not found. Because I couldn't find the problem I deployed the ear-file to the websphere application server via the admin console (new application). The ear-file I created using mvn clean install package. Then when starting the application from within de admin console the error is not given. In stead it is reporting that the remote interface of the GebruikerFacade is binded. What can be the cause of the error when starting the application server where the ear-project is added using add project. Extra info: Added 20141211 The reason why the bean class cannot be found is the fact that when the ear is deployed to the webspere application server via add project the business interface is empty within the deployed ear. This is a property in Enterprise Java Bean properties/Bind EJB Business of an Enterprise bean. The module, bean and uri property are set but the business interface which has to be the full path to the Remote interface class is not. When de ear is deployed on the application server via new application the business interface contains the Remote interface Class. Console-output in new answer below.

I am using Guava's Ordering in order to sort a list of entities based on the ordering of a list of id's corresponding to the entities. In some cases, there is a mismatch between the two lists (the id's come from the web GUI, while the entities from the database), since multiple users can manipulate the same enitity. In these cases, Ordering throws a IncomparableValueException. I would like to catch this exception, in order to present the user with an informative error message. But, I am unable to, since the exception is package-local, not public. This leads to exception-handling code that is more messy than it should be (I have to catch ClassCastException instead..) Why isn't this exception public in the first place? Since it's being thrown out of the Guava framework, I would expect to be able to catch it. Might also add that in my original version (13.0.2), the exception had javadoc + a TODO saying "make public and document", in the newest version (18.0), both the javadoc and the TODO is gone, exception is still package-local.
As the title underlines it, I am having trouble with the Java compiler for Ubuntu. I did a fresh install of the OS. Before uninstalling Ubuntu, a few months ago, Eclipse's Java compiler worked like a charm. I followed the exact same steps...: Install OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime (lastest official JDK on Ubuntu that worked for me before); Install the lastest version of Eclipse; Run it from my main folder, My documents, Desktop, separate HDD and separate partition... all failed; I think it has something to do with the compiler... I use Java 1.8 (the same as my Windows 8.1 compiler that works very well too). I remember exactly also that it was the same as the one I had a few months ago. I am getting compiler errors in a main method (System.out.println(), String, double, etc.) and I would like to resolve this a fast as possible. Here is an exhaustive list of the errors I am getting: import java.util.*; public class StackOverFlow {(...code...)} [Implicit super constructor Object() is undefined for defaults constructor. Must define a apecific constructor] S String(...); [String cannot be resolved to a type] Scanner (...); [Scanner cannot be revolved to a type] System.out.println(...); [System cannot be resolved] System.in ; [System cannot be resolved to a variable] Do I need to enable/disable some settings? Do I need to install or copy/create additional files? Anything else? All help is highly appreciated. Thank you!

I imported a small project with a pom file in Eclipse Kepler. Now (without me doing anything yet) this project is in red, and I am seeing these errors shown by Eclipse which I guess means I am missing some Eclipse plugin related to Maven support. "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:2.3.2:compile (execution: default-compile, phase: compile)" Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:2.3.2:testCompile (execution: default-testCompile, phase: test-compile) I already read here ... Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration maven error ... that I can get into some m2e connector mess but I want to avoid this as I don't have much time to waste on all this, I just have to get some code running with or without Maven. Also, I noticed this question above is about 2 years ago. Btw, I tried what it says but Eclipse didn't allow the installation saying I am having some conflicting dependencies?! So I decided to ask a new question: Why am I seeing this error and what's the simplest, and most reliable way to get rid of it? I have no experience with Maven, I just have a basic idea what it's about.
Question Have you ever made changes to your application and everything runs just fine but when you go to run your unit tests all hell breaks lose? That is my specific problem. Would it be fair to say those are not good tests since they fail when my application is working fine? And by 'working' I mean it passes all acceptance tests and each feature works as intended. Background Most of the time after I've made changes to my application I can run through all the features with no problem, then when I run my unit tests I'll have failures. So there are instances in which I'm spending lots of time updating unit tests that failed for a perfectly working application. My gut tells me that if your tests fail, when the application passes, then they are useless tests and all they are doing is alerting the developer to implementation changes they have just made. Is this wrong? Can good tests fail when nothing else in the application in question has failed? Example Scenario You have unit tests that verify a certain filename is returned such as fileName.txt. Everywhere in your code that file is referred to using a constant IMPORTANT_FILENAME so changing the file name doesn't affect your application. You decide to change the name of the file from "fileName.txt" to "NewFileName.txt". Your application works fine as it should, but your unit test on verify(fileName,'fileName.txt') fails. This is a crude example but I hope you get the point. The point here is that when I find myself updating unit tests on a working application it seems to me its a red flag that is a bad test. I can't think of any test that fails in a passing application that is a good one. But before I use this as a rule of thumb and start deleting I wanted to get some feedback. Do you agree; unit tests shouldn't fail in a passing application? Side-note: I don't think it matters but I use Java, Junit, and Mockito.
From time to time I get exceptions such as NoSuchMethodError or NoClassDefFoundError in my projects in runtime. Projects are built by Maven without any warnings. Investigations showed that these occurred because I had direct dependency in my project that required different version of a library I also used directly. So dependency tree might look something like this: my_project 1.0 apache http client 4.2.0 cxf 2.6 apache http client 4.1.0 or like this: my_project 1.0 apache http client 4.2.0 apache commons codec 1.9 struts 2.3 apache commons codec 1.4 I fixed these issues by looking for common compatible denominator of conflicting dependency. But this was only after I'd got error in production. So the question is how to prevent this type of errors to creep into production builds? I have some ideas how to solve this: Don't depend directly on library, if you already have transitive version of it. So, in case of dependency tree #1 I'd remove apache http client 4.2.0 and start using apache http client 4.1.0. I'd probably need to change my code to do this, but it seems fine for me. Or I could update CXF to a newer version, that uses apache http client 4.2.0 and remove direct dependency on apache http client 4.2.0 from my pom.xml. Is this case every incompatible change CXF team makes in relation to apache http client, I'll notice: my own code won't compile. Don't know how to use this approach with dependency tree #2. Use/extend some static analysis tool to detect missing methods or classes. What bothers me is that I couldn't find tools doing exactly this kind of work. It leads to conclusion that my problem has some other solution. Otherwise somebody would've created such a tool. Completely change my approach to builds. Build everything (all required libraries and my own project) from sources. Compiler will take care of checking for missing methods and classes. Write tests. Seems like a good approach. But it's hard to predict what flows should be tested (e.g. in production remote server could respond with some encoding scheme that I was unaware of) and testing all flows seems impractical, because basically you are rewriting library's tests. None of those approaches seem complete for me. What approach do you use? How do you solve this problem?
This may sound too amateur but as a whole i want to configure my Git repository and move my code from eclipse to Github. So i checked out a couple of video tutorials and applied the steps but none of them seems to work in my case. This is what i did. 1) Right click on the project > Team > Share Project > Select Git > and then this window comes now when i try to create my repository by clicking on create button> fill the parent directory and the name and click finish. Nothing really happens and i am redirected to the same previous window, without the repository column loaded. Can anyone help me out of this. First i thought it to be a Eclipse version issue, earlier i tried on Luna, also after installing Juno its the same issue. Help me with this. Thanks in advance.
I'm using IBM Websphere server policy & binding for securing my web service application by taking the guide of Red book "Was v7 : Web Service guide" but after going through all the steps While I tried to access the web service using the web client which is also using policy and binding as per the guide given in the book. But still I m getting a error saying..... Error 500: javax.xml.ws.soap.SoapFaultException: com.ibm.wsspi.wssecurity.core.SoapSecurityException: CWWSS6521E: The login failed because of an exception: javax.security.auth.login.loginException: com.ibm.wsspi.wssecurity.core.SoapSecurityException: CWWSS5312E: The application server cannot retrieve 'vivek' key from the **"D:\policyset\sender.jks" keystore. The following Exception occurred : java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Password cannot be null. Note : 1. keystore files are generated by myself using a ibm's ikeyman.bat file available as part of websphere server. 2. vivek key which server say's cannot find is the alias name of keystore. 3. I using sun jdk to generate this keystore as the same command is not working with ibm's was jdk. 4. In web service I'm just sending a text to server and returning it back to client. I'm not performing any sort of authentication except ibm's policy. 5. Here also I an encrypting only soap request body nothing else in request or response. Please help me and let me know if any other details required. Sorry guys I cannot upload screen sort as The issue is on development computer where I don't have access to public internet as well we have no way to transfer any file from development machine to this VM. Please suggest reference if you have already gone through that and it's working for you or some one to whom you have refer or got reference.
This class should be public (android.support.v7.internal.widget.ActionBarView.HomeView) Issue: Ensures that classes registered in the manifest file are instantiatable Id: Instantiatable Activities, services, broadcast receivers etc. registered in the manifest file must be "instantiatable" by the system, which means that the class must be public, it must have an empty public constructor, and if it's an inner class, it must be a static inner class. This lint error with the Support Library - which occurs when I try to export my (unobfuscated) Android project - is also described in this SO question. But why does this error occur in the first place? (Is it a bug with the Support Library?) The suggested advice in that question is to just disable/downgrade the lint message to a 'Warning', but is it perfectly safe/correct to do that (i.e., maybe that is papering over some cracks?) or is there a better solution?

I'm struggling to get breakpoints to work in a Google Appengine project. I followed the guide here https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/webtoolsplatform which explains how to set up a google app engine server on your local machine and run your app locally. I can do all that. I can access my app via http://localhost:8888 as well as http://localhost:8888/_ah/api/explorer etc. Now onto my problem. None of my breakpoints stop! Even when I place a break point in every possible location the server could go to, nothing happens. This is true when I browse code normally on the regular http://localhost:8888 site, or the /_ah/api/explorer section. When I shut down the server, everything stops (so I know the server created by Eclipse is the one running the show) and when I am in debug-view I can manually suspend the entire app (which will also I am running the Google App Engine tutorial project from Udacity: https://www.udacity.com/course/progress#!/c-ud859 It is a maven based project (though for this debugging, I am compiling using the Google App Engine tutorial linked at the top) It github repo is here https://github.com/udacity/ud859 And my forked repo where I have my exact code is here: https://bitbucket.org/esend7881/udacity-googleapp.git I really can't tell what I am missing here.
I'm starting to develop a backend service for apps using Google AppEngine Cloud EndPoints. I'm following the Google's tutorial on: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend/hello_world After I create the project using Maven in eclipse, it states the following errors: Description Resource Path Location Type Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: com.google.appengine:appengine-maven-plugin:1.9.4:endpoints_get_discovery_doc (execution: default, phase: compile) pom.xml /TestApp line 133 Maven Project Build Lifecycle Mapping Problem Description Resource Path Location Type Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.codehaus.mojo:versions-maven-plugin:2.1:display-dependency-updates (execution: default, phase: compile) pom.xml /TestApp line 80 Maven Project Build Lifecycle Mapping Problem Description Resource Path Location Type Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.codehaus.mojo:versions-maven-plugin:2.1:display-plugin-updates (execution: default, phase: compile) pom.xml /TestApp line 80 Maven Project Build Lifecycle Mapping Problem Nevertheless the project built, and it shows: "404 OK Hide headers - cache-control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate content-encoding: gzip content-length: 29 content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 date: Wed, 17 Dec 2014 23:25:53 GMT expires: Fri, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT pragma: no-cache server: GSE vary: Origin, X-Origin Not Found" I have no clue what it might be, any thoughts or tips on building it?
I have an application running in Tomcat using the Struts 2 framework. It works very well but I have a basic question about the flow of control. My struts.xml file contains many "action" tags which have name, method and class parameters. The included "result" tag determines where control goes when the specified method completes its work. All of this makes sense and works well. Many of my JSP files include an HTML "form" tag that calls one of my actions when the form is submitted. The thing I don't know is how to return to the calling JSP when an analysis performed in the method fails. Here is a summary of what I would like to do. (1) user puts "input" values in form and clicks submit. (2) the method called by the action retrieves the form data and performs an analysis. (3) when a criteria in the analysis fails, the previous JSP file reappears on the user's screen with the same input data filled in, and it has a dialog box explaining the problem. The one thing I don't know how to do is have the method trigger a restore of the JSP file with all of the user's values still inside the form fields.
I've been reading some answers here and they've really helped me, but I don't get that it works fine. This is the situation: Building witn Ant and debug flag to true. This is part of my build.xml: <javac srcdir="${src.dir}" destdir="${build.dir}" debug="true"> <classpath refid="classpath"/> </javac> And then I do: ant -file build.xml jar Upload the .jar to the server, reaching by ssh tunnel, and launching: BASEDIR=/path/to/the/base CP=$BASEDIR/mainApplication.jar:$BASEDIR/lib/someLib1.jar:$BASEDIR/lib/someLib2.jar MAINCLASS=package.to.the.main.Class echo classpath is $CP echo mainclass is $MAINCLASS java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m -Xnoagent -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=<port>,server=y,suspend=n -cp $CP $MAINCLASS $BASEDIR/file.properties SSH Tunnel: L<localPort> machine:<port> Remote debugging in Netbeans. In Netbeans I do Debug -> Attach Debugger, and these are my options: Debugger: Java Debugger (JDPA) Connector: SocketAttach (Attaches by socket to other VMs Transport: dt_socket Host: localhost Port: <localPort> So, after this configuration, I get to initiate Netbeans in debug mode, but when I set a breakpoint in any line, netbeans shows the next error message: Not able to submit breakpoint LineBreakpoint OneClass.java : 172, reason: Line number information is missing in the class file package.to.my.Class. Invalid LineBreakpoint OneClass.java : 172 What I'm missing? or What I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance.
I have created Java signed applet, it runs perfectly if I set my Java(JRE 8) security level high and add my site url in exception site list. But if we do not add site url in exception site list, java security exception comes as explained here : add url in exception site list I have created a signed applet using a third part certificate. Here is my manifest file after creating signed applet: Is there any option available to avoid these security blocking popups by adding some changes in manifest file while creating signed applet, or any script, java code to avoid these popups without adding site url in exception site list? Or is it really mandatory from Java that we must need to add site url in exception site list to avoid such blocking error. Basically is there any option available to add our url in exception site list through manifest file or any Java code ? Is it mandatory if I want to sign my applet using signed certificate then it must be a code signing certificate? wildcard or ssl certificate will not work? As I am getting self signed applet block issue though I have signed my applet with wildcard certificate.
I have bumped into a weird problem in feature that works well on all other installations, but not for one particular client. The "feature" involves an xpage with code in beforerenderrespons that picks up an uploaded file, gets filename etc and creates a context document. The context document is then passed as parameter to a java agent which process the file. The java agent is set to Run as web user and has Allow restricted operations. As I said - it works in all installations at other clients, but fails all of sudden on one installation. The only error message I get from beforerenderrespons event is "Error:Exception occurred calling method NotesAgent.runWithDocumentContext(lotus.domino.local.Document) null". I have confirmed that the agent is found but it never gets called. I have also confirmed that the context document also exists. The server console says nada. I have tested calling the agent with different run methods as in agent.run() but it does not make a difference. Now to the weird stuff - if I call a java agent that does not include a scriptlibrary it works! But as soon as I add a script library to the agent I get the error above. Why is that? Any help or clue appreciated. It feels like I have missed a security setting somewhere. The server doc includes the agent signer in "Sign agents to run on behalf of someone else", "Sign or run unrestricted methods and operations" and "Sign or run restricted LotusScript/Java agents" edit: Tested using a "pass-thru" agent that calls my original java agent that contains script libraries and that works! The pass-thru agent doesnt contain any scriptlibrary and simply calls my java agent and passes on the context document. Even so - I still want to know why calling a java agent directy fails if it contains a script library. /Katarina
After I have created a new project in the latest Android Studio (IntelliJ), I got an error message: Moverover, how to bring out the UI in the Android studio (IntelliJ) which was previously in the Android Eclipse? Gradle FirstApp project refresh failed: Error: Unable to start the daemon process. This problem might be caused by incorrect configuration of the daemon.

I am making a command processing library which takes input and throws an exception if the command cannot be executed for various reasons. I would like to provide helpful information to the user about what has gone wrong and I would also like all the messages to be customisable so it can be used in multiple projects. As I am dealing with user input there are a stupidly large number of things which could go wrong and making an exception for all of them would leave me with more exception classes than actual command processing classes so I have made a few generic exceptions: CommandException and CommandUsageException and CommandPermissionException which extend CommandException. Is it worth making an exception for everything that could go wrong for example InvalidFlagValueException or WrongSubcommandArgumentsException or is there a better way to do this? Is it a good idea to have an Enum for example in the exception to give it more detail?
I have upgraded my GAE server application with the latest GAE SDK 1.9.17 and it stopped work. I am facing a problem while performing 'entityManager.find(Profile.class, 'some long value representing profile id')'.

Code wasn't changed. I always did searches using 'long' values that represent profile id. I tried to use 'KeyFactory.createKey()' method to generate a key for 'find' method but it didn't help either. Example: Key key = KeyFactory.createKey(Profile.class.getSimpleName(), 12345); Profile p = entitymanager.find(Profile.class, key); I would appreciate any advises since my server application is unavailable and can't serve end users. Thanks in advance!
I am developing a Swing application with a component performing custom painting. When I make some mistake in the painting code and an exception is thrown, the situation is hard to debug. Instead of being caught by the debugger, a popup shows with the exception information. Moreover, the thread seems to be restarted, and as the exception is a result of coding error, it is shown again and again. When I am lucky enough to switch into the debugger (which is difficult, because more and more popups keep coming as the application gets paint requests), the debugging console shows me an exception information like: SEVERE: Uncaught exception thrown in Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0,6,main] .... stack follows My application is written in Scala and I am using IntelliJ IDEA 14. My uncaught main thread exceptions are handled fine by the debugger (I have Uncaught exception enabled for Any exception breakpoint enabled in the Java Exception Breakpoints), but exceptions in AWT threads are not. I have tried installing a handler as described in this How can I detect when an Exception's been thrown globally in Java? answer, but my handler does not seem to be triggered. I would like to achieve following (in order of importance): avoid the AWT thread restarting on exception, or at least prevent the popup from showing handle uncaught exceptions in the debugger instead of being printed in the console (Note: while this is Scala application, I assume the behaviour would be the same for Java, hence the Java tag).
i am pretty new to programming, and having some trouble with debugging java programs. I try to use gdb to debug my java program, but no matter how hard i try, it still does not work at all. The error message in the minibuffer of emacs(GUI) is always "No such file or directory , gdb". I am sure that my currrent directory is the the same as the sourcefile and the compiled file(executable file compiled with "javac -g xx.java") . So, my confusion is that: Does the error has something to do with: 1. wrong syntax of invoking gdb (used Meta gdb xx ) 2. what is the executable java file for gdb/ how gdb identify them 3. is it possible that my installation of EMACS is incomplete, as i input the gdb to the command line(Win8 system), NO gdb prompt appears at all(something like(gdb....))
I am seeing something very strange after my Tomcat starts up. I have 15 applications deployed, and everything seems OK until I try to access a specific page on a specific application. There are some cross-dependencies such as services. If I deploy the troubled application by itself, I can view the page without issue. If I deploy all the other applications one by one, I can view the page without issue. If all applications are deployed together at startup, this is when I see the following error: SEVERE: Can't instantiate page using constructor public

I've been using jmeter for a while now but it's my first attempt using a headless instance. I've created a single Test Plan with two thread groups. TG1: generates a source file of sample data. (432000 sample records) TG2: uses the sample data to fire of requests to another application. This works ok over short periods but when I run it over longer periods it dies with an Out of Memory error. I've reviewed the running application using visualvm and can see that the active thread count is 14,000+ almost from start up. The Used Heap shoots up and continues to death. the test is expected to create 432000 threads over a ramp up period of 43200 seconds. this is 10 threads per second over 12 hours. Interestingly the non-headless build lasts longer than the headless build with no listeners attached. I'm not sure where these threads are coming from? I'm assuming they are the threads that are to be fired off, are they created up front? I'm missing something here. EDIT I've already tried 'delay thread creation until needed' option. The threads are still created in advance and I have the same issue.
I am constructing a Command Prompt Process in my Delphi application which is able to interact with the JDB to compile, run and debug a Java application. Cmd input/output/errors are handled through pipelining from the cmd to/from my Delphi application UI. I want the output of the java program when using 'System.out' / 'System.err' to be directed to a component of my Delphi Application and I want input from my delphi application to be sent to 'System.in' allowing me to form a console in my Delphi UI similar to the console in the Eclipse IDE. A few thoughts on approaches; An obscure flag (I haven't found) in the Java compiler allowing me to redirect Using 'System.setOut'/'System.setErr'/'System.setIn' along with a main method in a class which performs this initialization before pointing to the normal main method to run the users code. NB - I have tried searching through the Eclipse sourcecode to see how they did it but as it is written in Java, I suspect they wouldn't face cross language issues I would face.

[ERROR] error: error reading /var/root/.m2/repository/org/openid4java/openid4java-full/0.9.5/openid4java-full-0.9.5.jar; error in opening zip file [ERROR] error: error reading /var/root/.m2/repository/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.31/mysql-connector-java-5.1.31.jar; error in opening zip file However, if I use mvn package (no sudo), then it compiles without errors, but does not function properly. The code is working just fine on a collaborator's machine, so the poms must be fine. I assume that there is something wrong with my setup. (He is using Eclipse and I am using command line and text editor)

I have installed Hadoop 2.6 on single machine using This Tutorial. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 machine and Java version 1.6.0_27. I have created separate user as hduser for Hadoop operations. I have set HADOOP_HOME envrioment variable's value /usr/local/hadoop where I have extracted the Hadoop distribution. Now I am following an example. But when I execute the command $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -ls /home/hduser/input/ it gives following error - 15/01/02 18:32:38 WARN util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable ls: `/home/hduser/input/': No such file or directory Also I have tried command- $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir /home/hduser/input/ , but still getting same error. When I run the command jps it shows - 16023 SecondaryNameNode 16200 ResourceManager 16432 NodeManager 18971 Jps 15503 NameNode It is not showing any process for JobTracker and TaskTracker. Can anybody please help me to resolve the issue of ls: `/home/hduser/input/': No such file or directory and to start/list the process for JobTracker and TaskTracker. Thanks in Advance.
I am facing a very strange type of java classpath problem. I have added path d:\javaext in the java classpath environment variable and when enter on the command prompt echo %classpath% , it shows the said path in the printed list but even then, when I try to compile a java file in which I am importing the package by adding import org.apache.commons.lang.*;, it some how says that the said package doesn't exist. The relevant jar file physically exists on that path also. Any clue that what am I missing, although it's a very basic stuff. I have also tried compiling it with setting the classpath on runtime by javac -cp or javac -classpath switch but even then no success. I am trying to compile the code with java 1.8 on windows 8.1 Can Anybody tell that what this alert means in the property dialog box of the jar file?

TLDR: I have many sequence files, I have to create the same amount of output files (also sequence files). If I do it sequentially I get a parallelization level dependent on the size of the input. I have roughly 4GB sized input files (lots of them), the default block size is 256MB, so the level of parallelization is roughly 16 which is not enough for me as I have many many more cores. So I created a command queue with the appropriate level of parallel execution in Java. For every command the parameters are a JavaRDD and an output path. Everything works fine while I use only map and filter transformations. But when I use sortBy it quits without telling anything. I don't even get an exception. It works perfectly if I use sortBy with the exactly same parameters on the main thread. I'm using Spark 1.2.0 with Hadoop 2.2.0 (compiled from source, works perfectly in every other scenario). With Spark 1.1.0 I had the same effect. I upgraded hoping this would be resolved.

I am developing an app that implements the google play games turn based multiplayer api.App works fine in my phone while I was developing and I could sign into multiplayer. But when I tested my app in another phone with same features and configurations, it shows error: Failed to sign in. Please check your network connection and try again. I am not positive if this has anything to do with my phone using my gmail account which is the developer account and the second phone using another gmail that is listed as a testing account for the app. I have the app in the alpha stage of testing but to put the app on the second phone I just physically hooked it up to my laptop like I did with my own phone. I have made sure that I am connected to the wifi and I am able to navigate just fine. There is no issue with my connection. Please let me know if you think you need more information. I appreciate the help. Thanks.
We are using the Exchange Web Service (EWS) API against Office 365 to create calendar events in the calendar of a user. This works fine for an on-premise deployment, but with an Office 365 deployment we seem to be hitting a throttling limit fairly quickly. After creating 16 events, in the calendar of 16 different users (from a service account, using delegate access to the calendars), we receive the following error: ErrorTooManyObjectsOpened - Too many concurrent connections opened After ~5 minutes, this error clears and we can continue creating events. It seems that the EWS server caches connections to mailboxes, and Office 365 only seems to allow a connection to 16 mailboxes at a time. We tried a lot to overcome this error, but have not found a 'final' solution or workaround. What we tried: Using impersonation instead of delegation: this works, but is a no-go from a security perspective. Using multiple service accounts: this works, although each account it still limited to ~16 users per 5 minutes. We tried the X-AnchorMailbox and X-PreferServerAffinity headers, and we making requests with and without HTTP keep alive, and with and without keeping the HTTP cookies.This does not make any difference. From the debug info we see that we usually end up on the same front-end and back-end server if we keep the cookies/connection, and that we end up on a different front-end if we drop the cookies but send a X-AnchorMailbox header. We have not yet tried the REST API, since the client credential flow is not available yet. Only the CreateItems call seem to cause this problem, we can do a FindItems for many users without hitting a limit. Is anyone aware of a way to overcome this limitation, e.g., is there some call we can do to close the cached mailbox sessions on the Office 365 side? Or is there an Office 365 administrator in the room who can shed some light on the exact throttling limits, and why they are so much lower than the on-premise Exchange throttling limits? Other details: we are using a modified version of the EWS Java API, but have done some extensive research and are quite sure this problem is server-side.
I have a Java Maven Project started in Eclipse, worked on it a few days, then imported it in IntelliJ IDEA, again working on it a few days. The normal Run/Execution in IDEA and via shell does work, but not the Debug. When I click the Bug Icon for Debug, it opens up URLClassLoader.java file and points on the Line "throw new ClassNotFoundException(name)" and pauses the Debug, if I click Resume Debug, it shows several Classes that do not belong to my project. I can click the Resume Button endless, it shows the same classes, also ClassNotFoundException over and over again in a continuously loop and does not debug my source. If I click Build -> Rebuild Project it says at the Debug icon "Hot Swap failed myClassname: schema change not implemented; myClassname: Operation not supported by VM" In the Debug window under Variables it says: "Frame is not available" The Debug of this project in IntelliJ IDEA did work previously, whats wrong now?
We had someone develop an Android app for us and although I have all his project files I cannot seem to get rid of the many warnings and errors that appear after import his project. I am not a Java programmer nor have I ever used Eclipse, so I'm running pretty blind here, but I need to fix a couple of bugs that I at least managed to find in the code. The developer saved his workspace as well as the Eclipse exe and all the jar files in a folder structure. What I have tried to so far is: Copied all his Windows folder structure onto my Windows machine Opened up the Kepler Eclipse exe in this folder structure Set the workspace to the existing "Workspace" folder in this structure Updated a bunch of .jar paths that were showing up as errors from his paths to my new paths (this resolved those errors) Installed API 19 in the SDK manager (and selectved it) in order to get rid of android-19 errors Added the Workspace default JRE in the Java Build Path section as there was none there and to try and get rid of the "Build path specifies execution environment J2SE-1.4. There are no JREs installed in the workspace that are strictly compatible with this environment." warning that I suspect is related to the over 200 resolve type errors I am getting. I've searched the forums to no avail. Any guidance would be appreciated.
What I understood about law of demeter is : Your method can call other methods in its class directly Your method can call methods on its own fields directly (but not on the fields' fields) When your method takes parameters, your method can call methods on those parameters directly. When your method creates local objects, that method can call methods on the local objects. but One should not call methods on a global object (but it can be passed as a parameter ?) One should not have a chain of messages a.getB().getC().doSomething() in some class other than a's class. What I'm doing in one of my methods is this : final ServiceStatusBean serviceStatusBean = new ServiceStatusBean(); serviceStatusBean.setName("someName"); serviceStatusBean.setApiVersion("someVersion"); My serviceStatusBean instance is created locally within the method and I'm calling setters on it. As per my understanding, Its fine with law of demeter. But according to PMD, its violating the law of demeter at the lines calling the setters. Warning- "Potential violation of Law of Demeter (object not created locally)" I'm not able to understand the reasoning behind these PMD warnings. Any explanations ?? PMD Details : Plugin version- 4.0.5.v20141105-1906 PMD version- 5.2.1
I just pulled down a repo that other people have been working on for a while. When I try to run "bundle" on the repo I get the following error java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException. However, all the Gems still bundle. I then run our rake task to create the jar (rake jar) and my jar comes out. Then when I run java -jar myjar.jar -h (our help command) I once again get java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException. I have seen others do the same thing, and it works fine. I assume this is some sort of environment issue since I did not change the code at all and it works for other people. I have both compiled & run the jar in Java 1.6 and JRuby 1.7.3 (Which is what other people are using as well). The Gems that are being used are: Bundler, Jruby-Jars, Jruby-rack, Nokogiri, Rake, Rubyzip, Trollop and Warbler. If anyone has any idea on why this would be cause, I would highly appreciate it. If you need any more information I would be happy to provide it.
This goes in the category of a minor, but constant, annoyance. I am using Eclipse IDE. It very helpfully marks warnings for various coding problems, including: Potential resource leak: 'connection' may not be closed This can be a very helpful warning when you are dealing with real resource objects, so I like to leave Eclipse configured to show the warning. However, when dealing with Mock objects in unit tests (in this example, it is a unit test friendly implementation of the java.sql.Connection interface.), it is a nuisance. The only way I know of to remove the warning is to add the @SuppressWarnings("resource") annotation to the code which is referencing the object. Unfortunately this has to be done wherever the Mock class is used, which means a lot of repetition for a frequently used Mock class. Is there any class level annotation that I can put on the Mock class to prevent the warning in the first place? Or is there some other means for preventing the warning for classes which don't really have any resource leaks?
We have an existing application which has an ANT script used for deployment and running on weblogic version 9.2.3. We had a request to upgrade the weblogic to version 12.1 and I was able to successfully upgrade this by changing the application specific WL_HOME and giving the build using the ANT script already present. But unfortunately we were having a dependency on another application that is running on weblogic 8.1 and weblogic 12.1 is not compatible with 8.1. So we are now in the process of downgrading the weblogic to version 10.3.6 and after installation of weblogic 10.3.6, I changed the same application specific property WL_HOME to point to weblogic 10.3.6 and tried the ANT build. But this time the ANT script failed, throwing errors saying error: package javax.ejb does not exist import javax.ejb.CreateException; The application and weblogic is installed in a solaris/unix machine and we are using jdk 1.7.0.60 for the application. I am not an expert on weblogic or ANT, and I couldn't figure out where I went wrong. I see that we have javax.ejb_3.0.1.jar present in the modules directory. It will be really grateful if somebody could let me know where I might have gone wrong. Thanks for your help in advance.
I cannot set java.library.path correctly and/or place my libraries in the correct location to be read by tomcat. There are a few SO posts that deal with this issue but the answers haven't been helpful. They seem to pertain to older versions of tomcat where conventions are different and sometimes conflict with one another. For reference: Native libraries not found in Tomcat java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError no *****.dll in java.library.path To be more specific, I have the following three files that I believe need to go in the right place: lpsolve.so - A C library lpsolvej.so - A JNI wrapper stub lpsolve.jar - A client JAR Clarification (if needed) can be found here: http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/Java/README.html I have been able to set this up correctly outside of tomcat. The .so files listed above are in /usr/local/lib/lp_solve_5.5.2.0 The following environment variables are set: LP_SOLVE_HOME=/usr/local/lib/lp_solve_5.5.2.0 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LP_SOLVE_HOME:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH /etc/ld.so.conf.d contains a .conf file with the path to the aforementioned .so files the ldconfig command was run Any help in getting things configured properly inside of tomcat would be greatly appreciated.

I am working on a IOIO project and I understand that the OS won't detect IOIO if you are using debugging on with 4.2.2 or greater due to secure debugging on a Nexus 4. I managed to downgrade it to 4.2.1 and the sample project works well with debugging on. So, I created my own project based on the IOIOSimpleApp and everything works fine. However, when I add more and more UI stuff to the activity, it stopped working with debug mode on, only works if it's AOA. Then I simply reverted everything back to IOIOSimple App, guess what, it still doesn't work. So my issue is, what is the magic that happened that makes my project doesn't work on 4.2.1 on debug mode? I checked everything from the Manifest to every single detail. I even tried to put the IOIOService to my project, that doesn't solve the problem either. My reason not to post any code is because I reverted all the code back to IOIOSimpleApp, you can grab it from their github. Thanks!

I'm new to Spring framework. I'm working on this web service tutorial, but I'm having some problems. Take a look at the project structure below: At first, while I was following the tutorial I created new classes in the bookmarks package, since that's where the Application file was located. However, when I did this then I couldn't import a lot of the packages required for the tutorial. I spent some time trying to figure out if I'd missed something in the project settings, or there was an error in Gradle or something (another thing I haven't used before) but I couldn't find any issues. I noticed if I moved the files concerned to the folder src/main then all the imports could be found without any issues. So I carried on with the tutorial; however, when ever I tried to add a new file to the src/main folder, buy right-clicking it, selecting new java file, etc... eclipse always puts the file in the src/main/java folder and again imports cannot be found. So again, I manually move the files to src/main. The File WebServiceDemo3Application.java was auto-generated by the project, so that has to be in the correct location. But after adding code to it, it cannot locate the files Account.java, Bookmark.java, etc... It must be something silly that I'm overlooking, can anyone help?
I have to switch from an execution environment which is Java 7 & tomcat 7.0.57 to java 8 & tomcat 8.0.15. To do this, I'm testing a webapp which I know that runs well on J7/TOMCAT7. I'm using maven, which is configured to use java 8, and deployment goes well. Meanwhile, I got this exception during execution time when I try to load my home page : An error occurred at line: 427 in the jsp file: /index.jsp The method proprietaryEvaluate(String, Class, PageContext, ProtectedFunctionMapper, boolean) in the type PageContextImpl is not applicable for the arguments (String, Class, PageContext, null) Full stacktrace : Stacktrace: at org.apache.jasper.compiler.DefaultErrorHandler.javacError(DefaultErrorHandler.java:103) at org.apache.jasper.compiler.ErrorDispatcher.javacError(ErrorDispatcher.java:199) at org.apache.jasper.compiler.JDTCompiler.generateClass(JDTCompiler.java:450) at org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler.compile(Compiler.java:361) at org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler.compile(Compiler.java:336) at org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler.compile(Compiler.java:323) at org.apache.jasper.JspCompilationContext.compile(JspCompilationContext.java:564) at org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service(JspServletWrapper.java:357) at org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile(JspServlet.java:396) at org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service(JspServlet.java:340) at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:725) at ev.resourceManager.easyvols.InnerJSPServlet.service(InnerJSPServlet.java:91) at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:725) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:291) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) at org.apache.tomcat.websocket.server.WsFilter.doFilter(WsFilter.java:52) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:239) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke(StandardWrapperValve.java:219) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invoke(StandardContextValve.java:106) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHostValve.invoke(StandardHostValve.java:142) at org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:79) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngineValve.invoke(StandardEngineValve.java:88) at org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:537) at org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractHttp11Processor.process(AbstractHttp11Processor.java:1085) at org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol$AbstractConnectionHandler.process(AbstractProtocol.java:658) at org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol$Http11ConnectionHandler.process(Http11NioProtocol.java:222) at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.NioEndpoint$SocketProcessor.doRun(NioEndpoint.java:1556) at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.NioEndpoint$SocketProcessor.run(NioEndpoint.java:1513) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(Unknown Source) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source) at org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.TaskThread$WrappingRunnable.run(TaskThread.java:61) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) Note that I'm not using any framework like Struts or Spring.

In my Java application I am developing a secure client server using jsse. I have 3 Java files that correspond to the Server and 3 that correspond to the Client. (Server,ServerController,ServerView) and the same for client. Each one of these files is in there own package e.g. ServerView is in the View package. The main Server and Client java files use classes from the other files so I am importing them using import server.serverSender; etc, this means I need to declare the package names at the top of my files. However when I export the class files and attempt to run the application and view the JSSE debug output using java -Djavax.net.debug=all in terminal i get an exception in thread 'main' java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: now I have found the source of the error, it is because I am declaring package etc at the top of my files because as I explained above I am importing classes into the main java files. I found the solution here exception in thread 'main' java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: How would I solve this problem? I tried adding all the files to the default package but I can't import classes from the default package they need there own package. So basically my problem is, I need to use package names at top of my files to import classes but I also need to run application in debug mode that doesn't work when using package names at top of files.
ProGuard stops with a lot of warnings: Warning: there were 1221 unresolved references to classes or interfaces. You may need to add missing library jars or update their versions. If your code works fine without the missing classes, you can suppress the warnings with '-dontwarn' options. (http://proguard.sourceforge.net/manual/troubleshooting. html#unresolvedclass) Warning: there were 37 instances of library classes depending on program classes. You must avoid such dependencies, since the program classes will be processed, while the library classes will remain unchanged. (http://proguard.sourceforge.net/manual/troubleshooting. html#dependency) Warning: there were 7 unresolved references to program class members. Your input classes appear to be inconsistent. You may need to recompile the code. (http://proguard.sourceforge.net/manual/troubleshooting. html#unresolvedprogramclassmember) Error: Please correct the above warnings first. But my jar runs correctly. I am not quite familiar with proguard setting. Any suggestion?
In Eclipse Luna I created a maven project enterprises-granny clone of github https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-granny.git. After cloning git , all source files are imported in a project.A server JAVA WEB shipped from SAP HCP is running on local host. Few applications are running on this server for testing purpose they works fine. In eclipse server project , there is a folder named webapps which includes 'hello','basecamp' e.t.c folder i.e. currently running apps on server , some of them includes maven as well. When enterprises-granny project is chosen to run as -> run on server -> JAVA WEB ->finish then it deployed all files to server without any error(s) .Now webapps includes one more folder enterprises-granny which includes all deployed files and then it opens a web browser with link http://localhost:8080/enterprise-granny but webpage content is empty i.e. empty page is displayed . Where as http://localhost:8080/hello (Another app to display hello world) displays a page with contents hello world. How to resolve this error ?
I have a HQLquery file that contains around 800 queries. Query to be executed in detected at run time and arguements passed from browser are mapped, by default my code converts argument passed from browser to Long.The problem is in some bean classes the variable(i.e Left side of comparision) is int and in some case it is Long. But at run time I am not able to think of any way to detect the "type" of Left side of comparison argument. say : select * from employee e where e.id=$empid$ $empid$ is replaced with the value passed from browser at run time and by default my code cast the passed value to Long. If e.id is int then this will throw ClassCastException . Is there is any way to detect type of e.id at run time. Or any other idea to solve this problem. I tried casting RHS to Number but it dint work for me. Any suggestion will be very much appriciated. Thanks
In Eclipse, "org.apache.axis2.AxisFault: Transport error: 403 Error: Forbidden" Error occured while trying to check out a project from svn. I colud not achieve this error and therefore I checked out the project from terminal using "svn -co" command. But, the funny side is that, when I try to run the application from within Eclipse, I've faced w/ same error again right after I entered my credentials (username and passwd) and pressed "Login" button. The response was Invalid username/password on the JFrame, but credentials was not wrong. This happens only in Eclipse. I can access SVN through web browser with same credentials. And I set proxies same as web browser. I am not able to overcome this situation furthermore. As to give info, I am on a virtual machine(MAC OS X Lion) through win7 Please provide some solutions to me asap. Thanks.

We've been using mule-module-redis-3.3.3-SNAPSHOT in production with mule 3.4.2 (standalone EE) for about two years now; works great, thanks! With mule-module-redis-3.4.0, our project's maven compile is ok (yes, we've refactored our code to use the different parameter signatures in some of the RedisModule methods). But we have been stymied so far with following error below when running any integration test within the maven build. (Our integration test classes simply extend mule's FunctionalTestCase class.) The one difference we've noticed for the redis-connector 3.4.0 is the RedisModule.set() method has an @Inject annotation; wondering if there could be some dependency conflict or missing dependency/configuration we might be missing? "... Error creating bean with name 'globalredis': Injection of autowired dependencies failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire method: public byte[] org.mule.module.redis.RedisModule.set(java.lang.String,java.lang.Integer,boolean,java.lang.String,org.mule.api.MuleEvent); nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type [java.lang.String] is defined: expected single matching bean but found 3: applicationVersion,mysqlPort,testConversionSendToBillingEnabled (org.mule.api.lifecycle.InitialisationException)" [I've had good suggestions, without success so far :( on the Mule Community Forum with this issue, so hoping there might be others more involved with the mule redis-connector who are here. Thanks!]
I have a Java application which reads Microsoft Word Documents (*.docx) and creates new stuff from their contents. It is in many ways a straightforward batch application. It works from a list of documents taken from a designated directory. It recurses all subfolders of this directory and creates a list of Strings which are the names of the docx documents. The list is then processed one at a time. It works correctly, processing all 288 documents in about 35 minutes and producing correct output for every document. In its single-threaded form it has been in use by me for three years without problems. In this case "correct" is what I define it to be, since it's my application. I should say that I rarely run the entire 288 -- only when I add new features. Many of the 288 documents are large -- 400 pages or more. Since my PC is a Core i7 which has 4 cores, each capable of two concurrent threads, I'd like to run some of these documents concurrently to see if it might be quicker. I have tried using a ThreadPoolExecutor to process the List, but I get a StackOverflowError about 20% of the way through the List. Clearly the StackOverflowError is not caused by the subfolder recursion. Is it simply a matter of making sure the objects created by each document go out of scope by themselves, or is there a recommended way of "forcing" them to release memory, such as setting to null at the end? I have tried to do both of these partially without success, and it will take me a week to do either completely. Is there a better or recommended strategy? The docx file format (what Microsoft calls Office Open XML) is a zip which contains XML files, which I convert using XSLT to my own format. That part is very straightforward -- using Java ZipFile and JAXP. The application is written on the principle of a Library, ie with Shelf objects containing Book objects containing Chapter objects. There are typically 10 to 20 chapters per book, each book is 300-500 pages or so, 288 books is the current count, over 100 more on the way. All told the application is over 10,000 lines of code so not viable to post the code. I deleted the few experimental lines of code for the ExecutorService -- it is a very simple API wrapping Runnable, and what I used was from googlable examples. I will try to remake an example of what I did and post it.
I try to cut and paste text component from one parsys to another on the same page and I get Unspecified error. If I copy, paste all OK. How could I fix it? I am using classic UI and AEM with SP1. My permissions are set correctly. Actually it is reproduced only on one PROD server during move from one parsys to another. In our continuous integration queue we have three servers. The first server DEV and the second server TEST are on our side and we have full access. The third server PROD is on customer side, we do not have full access and work with customer IT guys. Described issue is reproduced only on PROD server.

I have a war that I am currently building in Eclipse, where Camel is injecting an org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory to setup a JmsTemplate. If I run a maven build with the goal of jetty:run, the application deploys successfully. When I then copy the war to a tomee, it does not get started (although it does deploy). In the tomcat logs I can see that there is a ClassNotFoundException on the PooledConnectionFactory class, but when I inspect the war I can see that the class does exist in the lib folder, in the activemq-all jar, and this is also shown in my maven dependencies for the project. This derives from a NoClassDefFoundException on the same class. Could this possibly be due to competing classes, either in the tomcat container itself, or the war libs? If so how would I sort that out? Otherwise, has anyone else experienced this before, and figured out how to fix it? --Edit-- Turns out that since tomee contains its own ActiveMQ, this was probably down to class conflicts between the embedded ActiveMQ and the PooledConnectionFactory class I was trying to load. I am not sure how to fix this but presumably there's a way to use the same connection pool from tomee itself in a webapp. I just decided to use another instance of tomcat without the embedded ActiveMQ instead.
When using Spring's @Async annotation, the abstraction is leaky when it comes to (checked) exceptions in the throws clause of the method. The compiler will force the caller to handle the exception, but in actuality the caller will never see exceptions thrown by the @Async method. Instead, depending on the implementation, it will be handled & logged by Spring, or given to a user-configured exception handler, or produced when Future#get() is called on the return value. Therefore, I am forming the opinion that @Async methods should, as a rule, never throw checked exceptions. Instead, they should wrap all checked exceptions in types of RuntimeException so that no throws clause is present. Is this an accurate evaluation? Is there any tooling or programming approach that fixes the leak? Does anybody happen to know what the Spring developers think of this, or if there are any plans to improve the situation? Thanks!

I'm learning web application development and deployment, using NetBeans and Wildfly 8.2.0. I was curious as to how a web application is deployed, and decided to play around to satisfy my curiosity. I created a demo eCommerce JSF app with an eCommerce.war file, and deployed it using Wildfly's admin panel. It worked without any errors. Then, I changed the name & extension of eCommerce.war to testCommerce.abc and tried deploying it. And although not a .war extension, or .jar or .ear for that matter, it deployed succesfully, but I got a 404 when I tried to access it in the browser. I disabled the eCommerce.war app from the Admin Panel, and tried to access testCommerce.abc, but still got a 404. Can anyone explain why Wildfly does not check file extensions before deployment? Is it because it expects an archive file and/or the file extension does not matter? And why, when deployment has been successful, I get a 404 in the browser for the .abc application? Is it due to changes coming in the directory paths when .war is changed to .abc? I've posted the Deployments section's image from the Admin Panel for verification.
I have created a web application in java and is working fine. But i want to Convert few classes in JAR format, so that the code inside the jar is not visible to others. I have totally 5 classes. 3 classes (CreateFile,ProcessFile,HouseWork) belong to a package "FilePackage" remaining two classes are SFTPEngine and ExecEngine they belong to Package "PuttyEngine". I selected all these classes and gave export as JAR and named it mytool.jar. Now i deleted all these classes from eclipse and added the jar. In the Eclipse IDE after configuring the BuildPath no error was displayed. when I run the application on tomcat server from the IDE itself I get ClassNotFoundException How Do I export those classes into a JAR file and use them. These classes use functions from other classes as well. ie SFTPEngine class will access fucntions from others classes and other classes also wil be accesing the functions in SFTPEngine class. I am not using any build tool. Cause I cannot use them in my office , I need to get permission from admin, so is there any way to do this work without build tools like ANT or MAVEN
I've encountered these two exceptions in turn but in slightly different contexts and I am not sure what the situational differences are. From the Javadocs, I understand that the UnknownHostException is when a DNS lookup fails: hostname => IP address fails. From the Javadocs, UnresolvedAddressException: Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke a network operation upon an unresolved socket address. What does resolution mean in this context? The mapping from hostname to IP? My hypothesis right now regarding the difference is that UHE (UnknownHostException) would be thrown upon any failed lookup from a hostname to an IP using either the local mappings (like /etc/hosts or DNS) and UAE (UnresolvedAddressException) would occur when we store a reference to a network name without looking up what IP it translates to and then try to do something with it, like connect via HTTP. Does this sound correct? The weird thing is that sometimes during network issues, this would occur interchangeably in some code so I was not sure of the difference.
Coming from C#, when I used RX and there was backpressure, items would continually be added to internal queues until the application ran out of memory (as far as I can recall). In ReactiveX (RXJava), it would appear they have taken a different stance by throwing exceptions when backpressure starts to build. This means that I have to use something like onBackpressureBuffer() and in the call to subscribe() pass in a Subscriber<? super T> which makes requests up the stream to release the pressure. Maybe its because I am used the RX.NET approach to this, but it seems mental to me. Firstly, have I understood this correctly? Secondly, is there anyway I can "disable" this feature, so that it behaves in the same way as RX.NET as I don't want to complicate my subscribe() call by having to check if I have implemented one of these backpressure operators to see whether I have to call request() or not.

I have a problem with edition. In my MySQL database there is a date column. When I get it through DAO i have something like "2015-01-20 19:00:00.0". My update method works with the pattern "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm". There is no problem with add method, because when I click on the date input in my view - jquery formats it automatically (datetimepicker). And there is no problem when I'm changing the date in edit method (same script). The problem is when i get the data from database to my view and I just need to change name or something other than date. But the problem is - if i'm not clicking on the input form the pattern stays "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.f" and it's sent like this. And I get the http 400 error (syntax). I'm using java.util.Date with dao for this variable. If I use SimpleDateFormat I get deserialised error. If I use joda i get syntax error while sending "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm" through my view. Is there any chance my database can store date in "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm" pattern?

I am trying to use opencv 2.4.9. with maven, i have two files - the first one is a java file which is in a maven project , and the second one is a java file with all the opencv imports but this file is in the same package, am calling a function of second java file from the first one. The two files run fine separately as java project but when I try to run the complete maven project it throws this error - (java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/opencv/core/Core) and the build fails. After a lot of research i found out that the problem is mostly because of System.loadLibrary(Core.NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME); which am using to load opencv libraries. To rectify this, there are solutions to add opencv.dll to the java folder but since am working os x 10.9.5, i dont have dll's as they are found in the build folder under opencv, but build folder will only be there if we have installed opencv, and i cannot find a .dmg file for opencv. What should i do? PS: This is my first post on SO.
I am trying to run a java spark job, using spark-submit, on a cluster where all nodes have java 1.7 installed. The job fails with a java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/windlogics/dmf/wether/MyClass: Unsupported major.minor version 51.0. This error seems to be caused by compiling with an lower version of java and running with a higher version. However, I have verified that the code is being compiled with 1.7. Also, the job works fine when the master is set to local. How can I go about debugging and fixing this error? A part of the error log is below. 15/01/21 15:14:57 WARN scheduler.TaskSetManager: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0, sphddp07.zzz.local): java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:

I've recently learnt about throwing exceptions in java. I'm currently working on an exercise to write a method that takes one integer (between 1 and 100) as a parameter, and stores it against an instance variable. If the integer is not within the specified range, an error is reported through an exception. After much searching over which exception class to use, I believe IllegalArgumentException would be most appropriate in this scenario. However, with such a high volume of exception classes, is there a suggested methodology to establish which exception class to use? I am about to sit an exam whereby this sort of question is likely to be raised. I am able to bring in a textbook as reference material, yet time will be limited, and I certainly won't be able to/have time to go through all available exception classes. Are there more commonly used exception classes that I should always refer to first?
In my project (created in Netbeans 8), we have to create a war file and deploy on different machine, from Glassfish 4.1 admin console. Same process i.e deploying the war file from Glassfish 4.1 (opened from Netbeans 8) worked fine on our local machine on which the project is developed (in Netbeans).

I am loadtesting a system, part of which includes a WebLogic 9.2 system. Multiple other servers are also involved as back ends to what is deployed on WebLogic. I have a simulator that simulates the load that the system has to handle. It sends many requests to an application running on the WebLogic server. We are very close to handling the required load - except that occasionally there may occur short bursts, around 10 seconds in duration max, during which all requests sent by the simulator to WebLogic fail with 503 Errors. After this burst ends, all requests once again are successfully handled by the system for much longer intervals. I am quite unable to figure out what is actually going on when this happens. Is there a setting that would allow high level logging of 503 errors and high level logs of other events occurring on the server (preferably in the same log but perhaps not), so that we might correlate the 503s with whatever other event is putting load on the server?
I use Google Game Services not in the first time, I have 2 apps using it and doing it ok. Now I'm working on another app and found that even though it's connected to Google Play Game Services and shows me a user's name it can't use cloud save state feature. My android app was published and then unpublished, so it is not a draft. Game (in Game Services Tab of Google Play Developer Console) also is published. I have two linked apps with the same package name and different SHA1 footprints: for debug eclipse and release version (as suggested by Google). I've tried my old app on this emulator (genymotion) and it works and saves state. I've double checked everything according to https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/troubleshooting, but it looks that averything is ok. But when trying to save app state both in release or debug apk I get the same STATUS_DEVELOPER_ERROR and in logcat I see the same message: [97] a.a: Unexpected response code 403 for https://www.googleapis.com/appstate/v1/states/3 Error executing operation: Access Not Configured. The API is not enabled for your project, or there is a per-IP or per-Referer restriction configured on your API key and the request does not match these restrictions. Please use the Google Developers Console to update your configuration. Of course I've checked Google Developers Console and see that Google+ API, Google Play Game Services, Google Play Game Management and Drive API are on. I've even created a new Game (in Game Services Tab of Google Play Developer Console) and relinked my app to it, the same result: connection ok, yet STATUS_DEVELOPER_ERROR. I'm trying to compare my new app with the previous, but I use the same IabHelper of Bruno Oliveira. And for my previous game Drive API is turned off, but cloud save works. What did I forget?
I have few local and remote HornetQ client need to connect to the same HornetQ server. I always saw the "java.net.SocketTimeoutException: connect timed out" exception thrown by HornetQ for the first 2 minutes period when the system started up. After the 2 minutes later, then the connections would connect. I checked the connections which got exceptions were all from the local HornetQ clients. It confused me cause local connection should not have any issue compared with the remote connection, unless I configured wrong. Following are the configurations I used: Please point out if I made any mistake The HornetQ version I used is 2.2.5. As far as I know, the HornetQ allows connect from a netty connector to a netty acceptor (if they are configured with the same host and port). Or I should use the physical IP address for the local connection instead of localhost ? Thanks for your sharing
I am developing a Web Application in java, deployed in a WebLogic server. I have the server created with the datasource to an oracle database that works fine. In the other side, I have the WebApplication that I can´t deploy in the server. When I clic in the button "Deploy", the following message appear in the "server log". Exception Description: Cannot acquire data source [jdbc/siam]. Internal Exception: javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: While trying to lookup 'jdbc.siam' didn't find subcontext 'jdbc'. Resolved ''; remaining name 'jdbc/siam' "jdbc/siam" -> is the name of the datasource that I want to use in my webapplication. I hope you can help me. Sorry for my English. Thank you. /UPDATE/ I have the connection to the database defined in the server side. I can´t include images, but I can view the database connection in the netbeans and the name for jndi is "jdni/siam". And in the administration console of the weblogic, I can view it as datasource with the same name.

I am constructing a mutli-module library for Android using AS and Gradle. Each module is published to an Artifactory repo independently but in sync as a complete version number with each module having the same version number (e.g. full library version is 1.2.1 then each module is republished as 1.2.1 for that release to stay in sync). The issue is that I am trying to automate the release build and publication of all of these libraries in unison with Gradle but each module relies on a 'core' module which holds the shared logic. The issue arises when I try to create these gradle build tasks with the core module as a provided dependency e.g.: provided 'xyz.abc.mylib-core:' + version Where version is the shared release version. I have made a gradle task which performs each step of the cleaning, release build, test and publication of each library like so: task artifactoryPublishMyLibCore(dependsOn: [':mylib-core:clean', ':mylib-core:test', ':mylib-core:jacocoTestReport', ':mylib-core:sonarRunner', ':mylib-core:assembleRelease', ':mylib-core:artifactoryPublish']) task artifactoryPublishMyLibModule1(dependsOn: ['artifactoryPublishMyLibCore', ':mylib-module1:clean', ':mylib-module1:test', ':mylib-module1:jacocoTestReport', ':mylib-module1:sonarRunner', ':mylib-module1:assembleRelease', ':mylib-module1:artifactoryPublish' ]) Now the problem comes when trying to sync gradle Error:Failed to resolve: xyz.abc.mylib-core:1.2.1 Which is fair enough as at this point the library will not have been published but when the build task is run it will be published by the time it is required and also I am using core as a 'provided' runtime dependency in each of the modules so it is not required (as far as I know) to compile each module. Am I missing something obvious here and if not is there a way to: Not fail the build when a runtime dependency cannot resolve? or Stub the dependency that gradle cannot resolve for the sync as it will be available when the actual compile occurs on the modules? Any and all help appreciated. Edit: Note that this is not an issue for debugging as I use the modules are included as project dependencies when doing a debugCompile it is only when trying to do the release where the dependencies must be properly referenced for the Artifactory.
Good time guys! We have a pretty straightforward application-adapter: once in 30 seconds it reads records from a database (can't write to it) of one system, converts each of these records into an internal format, performs filtering, encrichment, ..., and, finally, transforms the resulting, let's say, entities into an xml format and sends them via a JMS to other system. Nothing new. Let's add some spice here: records in the database are sequential (that means that their identifies are generated by a sequence), and when it is time to read a new bunch of records, we get a last-processed-sequence-number -- which is stored in our internal databese and updated each time the next record is processed (sent to the JMS) -- and start reading from that record (+1). The problem is our customers gave us an NFR: processing of a read record bunch must not last longer than 30 seconds. As far as there are a lot of steps in the workflow (with some pretty long running ones), and it is possible to get a pretty big amount of records, and as far as we process them one by one, it can take more than 30 seconds. Because of all the above I want to ask 2 questions: 1) Is there an approach of a parallel processing of sequential data, maybe with one or several intermediate storages, or Disruptor patern, or cqrs-like, or a notification-based, or ... that provides a possibility of working in such a system? 2) A general one. I need to store a last-processed-number and send an entity to the JMS. If I save a number to a database and then some problem raises with the JMS, on an application's restart my adapter will think that it successfuly sended the entity, which is not true and it won't be ever received. If I send an entity and after that try so save a number to a database and get an exception, on an application's restart a reprocessing will be performed which will lead to duplications in the JMS. I'm not sure that xa transactions will help here or some kind of a last resorce gambit... Could somebody, please, share experience or ideas? Thanks in advance!

I have a Java program calling a R script using JRI. On calling re.eval("setMatValue('" + id + "'," + x + "," + y + "," + value + ")"); i get a java out of memory exception which is strange to me as neither the function in R is returning a value of any kind, nor am i mapping the (not existing) result to a java object. The matrices are only stored in the R context and referrenced by strings. Is the Memory used by R included into the Java Heap? Or is JRI allocating space that actually isn't needed? For the greater scope: I am trying to outsource the handling of the matrices used by my Code Analyzation implemented in Java to R. The matrices get very big, and therefore were taking up too much space in java, and I didn't find any matrix implementation in java able to create matrices of that size.
I have searched for this already and the results have been slightly different to what I am looking for. Any help is greatly appreciated! I've built an Android app which uses cryptography and it works perfectly in debug mode when I test it, however, when I go to generate a signed APK (I've changed the build variants to release and included ProGuard to run) this error occurs: NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class javax.crypto.JceSecurity: Could not initialize class javax.crypto.JceSecurity I have checked my JDK under External Libraries and it's using 1.7.0_67 and JceSecurity IS there under the correct package structure. I also have the local_policy and US_export_policy jars under the jre/lib/security too. Under External Libraries I have: < Android API 20 Platform > JceSecurity isn't in android.jar > javax.crypto < JDK > (C:Program Files...\jdk1.7.0_67) JceSecurity is in jce.jar > javax.crypto Is there a bit of a muddle up here? The JceSecurity class is there so I don't understand why it can't find it. Do I need to add any permissions to the Manifest or change the build.gradle? Also, once this goes to the app store will users have issues with it as they may not have local_policy and US_export_policy jars installed on their machines? Any ideas people? Thank you very much in advance! :)
On upgrading our project to JDK 7 and JEE7 I'm hurt with Verification Error, but without any usable information in the log, even with the debug flag turned on. I'm using the latest maven version available, i.e. V3.2.5 with all plugins having the latest version of today! Eclipse Luna and jdk1.7.0_76 64 bit from Oracle on win7. The VM argument -XX:-UseSplitVerifier suggested in other answers doesn't change any thing! But what I can say for sure is: With the maven goals: package, install or deploy given no Verification Error happens and every Junit test comes out green. The Verification Error shows up with the goal „site“ given! Then not a single JUnit test passes! Useless to say that the problem never appeared with JDK 6 on the same project which started more than 3 years ago and which runs successfully in production at many sites! Who has an Idea what could go wrong on generating the reports for the site goal?

My Android application manages multiple fragments. I am seeing a large number of crashes in the field, however, containing this log line: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failure saving state: active XxxFragment{81e598 id=0x7f0b0069 tag_yyy} has cleared index: -1 Searches of answers in Stack Overflow have been fruitless; I seem to have a lot of company in wondering exactly what this exception means. Digging into the exception trace and Android sources, I can see that the exception is coming from the point at which my main Activity is saving its state (FragmentActivity.onSaveInstanceState), and the individual Fragments are being written into a Parcelable. Each Fragment has an index (called mIndex) which must be nonnegative, but it's not really clear from the code why that must be the case, as mIndex is never used again in that function. I have no good idea how the Fragment gets into this state, or what I can do about it. I have been unable to reproduce the error in my own test environment. Can anyone shed any light on how to avoid and/or deal with this exception? Related SO questions: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failure saving state: active has cleared index in fragment What does active fragment has cleared index: -1 mean and how do I fix it?

I am currently using Eclipse Luna on Windows 8.1 on a 64 bit system. I have recently been trying to learn Android development on Eclipse. For the past two weeks or so everything has been functioning fine and Eclipse (as well as the Android SDKs) were installed properly and working. Today however, whenever I tried to start Eclipse the loading screen would pop up for a few seconds, the program would then stop responding and close shortly after that. This was especially confusing because no error messages would pop up and I have no idea what's wrong. I have already tried to delete some of the .snap files found in .metadata.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources but could not find any. And as per this topic Eclipse Crashing on Startup Tried to increase the memory but neither of these things have helped. I would greatly appreciate if anyone could give me some advice on how to fix this. Thank you.

Please help me to solve the issue. I built a WAR (uising Maven) but when I tried to deploy it in Tomcat I got an Exception: org.apache.jasper.JasperException: Unable to compile class for JSP: The method getJspApplicationContext(ServletContext) is undefined for the type JspFactory I found the cause of the problem on stackoverflow - the issue is in inconsistency of the Servlet API in project's classpath and relevant libraries used by current version of servlet container. The provided solution is to avoid adding any Servlet API relevant libraries (servlet-api.jar, jstl.jar, jsp-api.jar, etc.) to lib - folder. I also found a solution for Eclipse ([How do I import the javax.servlet API in my Eclipse project?). But I develop in IntellijIDEA and it differs from Eclipse. In my case there is no possibility to not add servlet-api.jar and jstl-${version}.jar to classpath. If I don't add them I can't compile a project. If anyone can assist me in the issue I would thankful a lot.

I thought that maybe I could rearrange my source code into different folders based on what the source code files pertained to. So I did, and I realized that it might cause some problems. I put all of the source code files back in the main folder, and now I am receiving the syntax error: duplicate class: retailapplication.AddNewCustomerDialog. My question is this... How do I get rid of this issue? It does not appear as though I have more than one copy of the source code files (which isn't possible anyways, because Windows wouldn't have allowed me to do that), so I'm not sure where it is assuming that I have a duplicate. For what it's worth, I am using the NetBeans 8.0 IDE. Any help would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: 02/01/2015 (9:43 PM MST) - I put ALL of my files into different folders, and I am receiving this error on three of my source code files.

We have got a Jenkins Master with several slaves. The slaves are started via JNLP. The jobs are executed using ant. When the job executed by a slave times out, the ant-process is not terminated. Timeouts occure because of endless Unit-Tests, OutOfMemoryErrors etc. The next time the job starts, Jenkins tries to clean the workspace before executing the job. It fails, because of a java.nio.file.FileSystemException. The exception is caused by the ant-process still running on the slave. It has got handles on the files. My Time-out configuration: Time-out strategy: absolute Timeout minutes: 3 Time-out variable: 660 Time-out actions: Default (abort the build) My workaround solution is to terminate the ant-processes manually whenever a job timed out on the slave. How can I prevent this problem? How can I make sure the ant-processes executed on the slave machines are terminated in case of Job-Timeouts?
I've been researching for many hours about a possible solution to this but whatever I try it just fails. Here's the explained situation: I have this library project on Android Studio which generates the app-debug.aar file. Then I add this new module in the implementing project, following the wizard to import .JAR/.AARs I pick the .aar and update the dependency for :app in the Project Structure. Once the project is cleaned (even using ./gradlew clean--Mac OS X) I can make references of this class and its methods in any of the activities. Now at runtime, once built and installed on the real devices the app will crash throwing the aforementioned Runtime Exception. Note: I'm importing the .aar because I would need to protect the code and it has resources so a .jar is out of the question. And if I import the library module (with source and all instead of an.aar) then the app has no issues at runtime. I've tried everything and if anyone can throw some light on what this could be, it'll be highly appreciated. The class extends ViewGroup and is instantiated at runtime in case that implies anything. The code was given to me so major changes might not be possible unless it's absolutely necessary. Thanks beforehand to all! Armando

I'm using Eclipse in order to compile & run Java applications. I'm creating several projects, which I export as a jar file and import (add to build path) them as jar file in the other projects. I add the jar as follows: copy the jar to the project I want right click on the jar -> build path -> add to build path It is my first time I'm getting this error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError I created a project which uses POI jars. The project name is "A". I export this project to A.jar file and import it (add to build path) in B project. When I'm running the B project and try to init (call the constructor) of an object from A.jar, I'm getting the following error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/poi/ss/usermodel/CellStyle I checked the following threads: Why am I getting a NoClassDefFoundError in Java? java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError while running jar But didn't find the answer. Why am I getting this error? It isn't my first time, that I'm importing/adding to build path. But now I'm getting an error. How can I solve it?
I have a classic Java EE system, Web tier with JSF, EJB 3 for the BL, and Hibernate 3 doing the data access to a DB2 database. I am struggling with the following scenario: A user will initiate a process which involves retrieving a large data set from the database. The retrieval process takes some time and so the user does not receive an immediate response, gets impatient and opens a new browser and initiates the retrieval again, sometimes multiple times. The EJB container is obviously unaware of the fact that the first retrievals are no longer relevant, and when the database returns a result set, Hibernate starts populating a set of POJOs which take up vast amounts of memory, eventually causing an OutOfMemoryError. A potential solution that I thought of was to use the Hibernate Session's cancelQuery method. However, the cancelQuery method only works before the database returns a result set. Once the database returns a result set and Hibernate begins populating the POJOs, the cancelQuery method no longer has an effect. In this case, the database queries themselves return rather quickly, and the bulk of the performance overhead seems to reside in populating the POJOs, at which point we can no longer call the cancelQuery method.
I read a hundred posts related to this but nothing seems to help my case. A strange thing is happening with my commands. To start off, for the current task I need to be using textbook libraries from an algorithms book and the installer from that book also sets up Java SE 7. I have Java 8 JDK installed on my pc from before (if that is info worth knowing). So, for example, when I am running programs which involve methods from that textbook library I write java-algs4. Last night there was something wrong with the Path variables and I wasn't able to compile anything so I was setting some of those and then things started working. However, today, when I tried running java helloworld (after doing javac helloworld.java) I got the error mentioned in the title. Moreover, I could successfully run another class file in the same directory but after I ran it once, I couldn't anymore and got the error again. This seems like black magic to me! When I echo %CLASSPATH% I get the current directory. Here are my current java-related PATHs set in my environment variables if this is of any help. The algs4 is the one from the textbook.

Following the style used in Joshua Bloch's Effective Java and in agreement with the answers to this question, I've used AssertionErrors in the past in the Java SE environment for code paths that should never possibly be executed. Looking at Java EE, the EJB 3.1 specification says If the bean method encounters a system exception or error, it should simply propagate the error from the bean method to the container (i.e., the bean method does not have to catch the exception). and a little further down, it says that the concerned EJB instance has to be discarded in the case of a non-ApplicationException. As far as I know, if another instance of that EJB is required in a subsequent request, the container takes one from the pool or creates a new one if necessary, so there should be no problems associated with that (except of course if it was a @Singleton EJB). Is it appropriate/good style to use an AssertionError in a session bean method for indicating programming errors? Or is there a more fitting Throwable subtype for that?
I'm using Cucumber reporting Jenkins plugin (http://www.masterthought.net/section/cucumber-reporting) to show all cucumber results to all stakeholders. The tables display the number of steps passing and pending, which is good : at the beginning of the sprint, I add my scenarios, and all new steps are pending. Little by little, they will pass. But I face an issue : with cucumber, pending steps are actually throwing a PendingException by default, until we actually implement them. And these PendingExceptions make my Maven build unstable, as they are seen as test failures, which they are not. So more generally : is there a way to configure Maven in such a way that some exceptions are ignored and my build succeeds ? Ideally, I would like to configure somewhere a list of Exception classes that shouldn't be taken into account : if only PendingException is thrown while executing my test suite, build should be OK and pending steps should show in Cucumber report. I couldn't find anything so far ; I've looked at surefire, but I would need something more than the testFailureIgnore property : I need to also specify which type of failure I ignore. Did anybody come across this use case before ? Thanks Vincent
I have a set of java web applications I want to run from my own computer, using the TomCat web server. They all worked OK up until I installed java 1.8.0_31. It took a while to get around the permissions problem to start the application but after that I can't get past an AccessControlException trying to connect to my local "database server" (which runs in TomCat) from my browser. The database server is running OK, because I can connect to it using the AppletViewer. I created a policy entry and added it to the runtime java security: grant codeBase "http://localhost" { permission java.security.AllPermission; }; I've tried some variations on the http://localhost (adding the port and application name) but none of them work. The code base is unchanged since it worked before. With these new security features, I can't run web applications running on the same computer.
I have searched for a solution to my problem on stack overflow . Before marking this question as duplicate, please understand that I have tried all the possible solutions that were posted, but I still have the above errors. I am running the default Hello World android program, so haven't made any changes in the code . The Minimum supported sdk version=8,Target build = sdk android API 21, Compiler sdk= android API 21 and Environment: Eclipse Juno. Things that I tried : - I have deleted appcompat v4.jar from the appcompat workspace folder, which leaves me with just appcompat v7.jar I have added appcompat_support_v7.jar as external jar. I have tried refreshing, restarting eclipse and cleaning but errors still persist. Error being: "R cannot be resolved to a variable Type: Java Error". For android 5, JRE 1.8 is needed so I have installed that and set the windows environment variable to the path where jdk1.8 is saved. i.e. JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_31 Using cmd when i do echo %JAVA_HOME% it prints the above path. Though I am still unable to run java programs from cmd using 'javac'. I have then set the path for jdk1.8 by going to Eclipse, window>preference>java>installed jres , the path being : C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_31 I have also then gone to Eclipse, window>preference>java>installed jres>execution environment and checked the compatiability of SE 8. Even after restarting Eclipse, the first error I get is : "Parsing Data for android-21 failed Unsupported major.minor version 51.0". and at the bottom in the problems tab ,the error I get is : "R cannot be resolved to a variable - Java Error" My Android Support library is up to date and I have installed all the necessary packages using SDK manager for Android API 17 and 21 . Please note that I have JRE 6 ,7 and 8 installed on my computer because I am using those versions in another eclipse for J2EE, but in eclipse (Juno) for android I have set the path for jdk 1.8. I think it has got something to do with Java installation, but I don't understand what exactly I have done wrong. It would be great if you could help me out. Thanks in advance.
I know that similar questions have been on SO and I have read through and tried to implement the solutions mentioned but nothing is working. The specific problem is like this (using ECLIPSE): I am trying to implement location awareness in one of the activities (triggered through menu selection) in my app. As long as my code looks like, "public class MealHistoryActivity extends Activity {...}", I don't get any error. As soon as I modify it to public class MealHistoryActivity extends Activity implements ConnectionCallbacks, OnConnectionFailedListener, LocationListener {..", it throws in the following error: E/AndroidRuntime(5027): Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.package.activities.MealHistoryActivity" on path: DexPathList[[zip file "/data/app/com.package.activities-2/base.apk"],nativeLibraryDirectories=[/vendor/lib, /system/lib]] What I have tried: Adding up the library projects (support library as well as google play services) and cleaning all the projects. Including Android Private Libraries for the application as well as the library projects. Double-checking the API key in android manifest as well as the SHA-1 fingerprint key associated to it. Using all the internet and network permissions in the manifest that are needed for location services. Would greatly appreciate any ideas on how to solve this since I am stuck on it for the last few days!
When working with threads in Java, dealing with InterruptedException seems to be a particular thorn in my side. I appreciate the fact that it's thrown when my threads are terminated, and thus offers me a chance to cleanup. What seems odd to me is that it's not an unchecked exception. This creates the following problems: a) If I want to use an existing framework in my threaded app, I'm forced to convert it to an exception the framework interface accepts. Thus the framework generally misinterprets it instead of either cleaning up or propagating it as it should. b) Unless InterruptedException is rigorously declared for every call in the stack (and it's usually not because of a) ), it's difficult to cleanly shutdown. If InterruptedException were instead unchecked, it seems that it would have a much higher likely hood of being used properly and resulting in clean shutdown of threads and apps in general. Why isn't it?
I am currently implementing a fullscreen-exclusive mode in my Java2D-Application. While testing on several systems (all Windows 7/8.x) with most recent (18. February 2015) JRE, I can reproduce a application crash which does NOT throw an exception: If you are in fullscreen-exclusive mode (yes: I check for supported display modes) and turn off the monitor which displays the application, the application crashes. No exception thrown. My guess is, that the vsync-component of Java2D crashes, but I lack the required experience in Java. Can someone help me out here on how I can handle this exception (by switching back to windowed-mode for example). Something like "isDisplayDeviceReady()" might also be helpful. Thank you for your time. This is what Windows shows me after application crash: Problemsignatur: Problemereignisname: APPCRASH Anwendungsname: javaw.exe Anwendungsversion: 8.0.31.13 Anwendungszeitstempel: 54925fd3 Fehlermodulname: StackHash_915d Fehlermodulversion: 6.1.7601.18247 Fehlermodulzeitstempel: 521ea8e7 Ausnahmecode: c0000374 Ausnahmeoffset: 000ce753 Betriebsystemversion: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.48 Gebietsschema-ID: 2055 Zusatzinformation 1: 915d Zusatzinformation 2: 915d12e427f130d100a5a047f72f08c0 Zusatzinformation 3: 8dd4 Zusatzinformation 4: 8dd4ced129ecb79ce625a0ed8d82cee9

I'm developing a small application to learn JavaFX with. I've run into an issue where when I run my app with an IDE (Eclipse) it works perfectly. However when I export the project to a runnable Jar file, and try to run the jar file, the window I want to pop up doesn't. I've exported it as every type of the three options eclipse allows. I ran it through the command line to get the stacktrace: http://pastebin.com/tfkJFnEZ The rest of the app works great, just this one window. What is puzzling to me (as a beginner) is why it will run in Eclipse but not after exportation. I'm not sure what is changing in the way I want to open the file, so I'm not sure where to look for my error. If there is anything else I need to provide to assist just let me know, I appreciate any advice anyone can give.
Clean install of version 14 CE on OS X 10.9.5. Originally I thought it could be because the compiler is version 1.8 and the jdk is version 1.6. I've manually configured the JVM version in Intellij properties now so that it is 1.8 (e.g. so that About intellij shows v1.8). However the problem persists. Javac on the command line works ok, just Intellij that has the problem.

It might cause because the URL with proxy is not exactly the same as the one provided by CA.(Like example.com:8888 but CA provides example.com) I tried to fix it by reading this article, but it didn't help me. The same situation happen with mitmproxy. I've already added the .cer file as a trusted ca to JAVA cacerts. Is there any way to avoid or disable the warning? As I got the Error in Japanese, I provide the same error of the English version from web. java version "1.8.0_31" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_31-b13) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.31-b07, mixed mode)
I crawled a batch of 15K urls and saved them as a html file. In the first iteration I got output for 10980. And In the second iteration it is decreased to 9700. And in the third iteration it is 11120. So I checked the results(hints/exception written in catch block) written in a text file. Most of the urls failed due to java.net.UnknownHostException some urls failed in first and third iterations but saved successfully in second iteration. I googled forums where in most cases the reason given is like Thrown to indicate that the IP address of a host could not be determined. My question is how it was crawled successfully in my second iteration? Please provide some solutions to resolve UnknownHostException or to find the IP address of the host. Note: The above iterations are done with Multithreads(300) using Executor Service. I tried with single thread. Now there is no difference in the output count in various iterations. I also used the option -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true suggested in comments. But still I am getting UnknownHostException.
I have an amqp-backed channel <int-amqp:channel> to temporarily persist messages coming from a JDBC inbound adapter. when no exception is thrown, the message is ack'd and removed from the rabbit queue. when an exception occurs, the message is returned to the queue and is reprocessed continuosly. There are some circumstances where I'd like the request to go back to the queue, but in most cases I just want to log the error and acknowledge the request (remove from the rabbit queue). I've implemented an errorHandler to deal with thrown exceptions and allow for logging and "successful" completion, however even after handling, the original request is redelivered to the rabbit queue (unacknowledged) in the inbound-rabbit-adapter, there is a property for error-channel and handling the message on the errorChannel allows me to achieve the desired behavior described above. the only error property on the amqp channel is errorhandler. any suggestions on a configuration that would allow me to meet my requirements? thanks
In the Intellij IDEA Java Debugger window, how can I show the implied iterator values and the collection for a for/each loop? For example I made this simple loop through puppy names. I want to be able to see in the debugger window where my index is for the loop and be able to see the collection that I'm looping through. That is, I want to know what index I'm at. Like for "milo", I want to know that I'm at index 0. Older versions of IDEA used to have a variable like "i$" in the debugger variable display. And it would have a variable, I'm pretty sure, for the collection itself. I'm using the latest version, 14.0.3, on Mac OS Yosemite 10.10.2 (JDK 1.8 build 25 from Oracle). Obviously this is a simple example that I've constructed solely for explaining my question. Here is my debugger settings menu
After reading a lot about the abusive use of exceptions in Java and how you should let an exception bubble up through the different layers of an application, I've come to a point where I don't know what I am supposed to do with the potential errors my application can have. Basically, I have a webservice which uses the DAO pattern to access data in my database. All of the database actions can throw a SQLException. As of today, I'm using a try catch to catch the SQLException and then thow a specific defined exception called ExceptionDAO that will be handle by the webservice to return a correct message to the users (a mobile application) of my webservice. After reading a lot about how exception should be exceptional and should not be used in control flow, I've come up with a mixed understanding of what I should do to handle any errors: Use return codes for anything that is likely to happen (e.g. username already exists) and therefore, to comply with the DAO pattern, pass my business objects as parameters instead. I could also use a specific pair which would return the code + the business object instead. The webservice would then use the return code to display a specific message. Use checked exceptions for anything that I can't predict will happen and let them bubble up to the webservice to handle and return a message to the users. (e.g. SQLException that I can't predict : connection aborted) Let unchecked exceptions bubble up aswell and display a sort of 404 error in this case. I also had a look at the null pattern but I don't think it suits this particular situation really well. I'm also concerned to not give too much information to the users, but rather useful and straight to the point information. Indeed, the messages returned by the webservice will be used by a mobile application to then display a message to the end-user. I hope that I was clear enough about the problem I'm having, and I'm looking forward to your answers !
I'm using Jmeter to inject workload to an application deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. The test has to be very huge: it lasts for 10 hours and the workload profile has a bimodal shapes with a pitch of about 2600 requests in 5 minutes. Actually I have one m3.xlarge instance in which the application is deployed and 8 m3.xlarge instances each one running a jmeter instance. With a python script the workload to inject is splitted among the 8 client instances so in example if the original workload as to inject 800 requests, each jmeter instance will inject 100 requests. The full test as I said lasts for 10 hours and is divided into timesteps of 5 min each. Every 5 min a little workload variation is applied. Actually I get from each jmeter instance the java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded error immediatly after the test is started and no request arrive to the application. I read a lot online and on stackoverflow, and I concluded the possible mistake could be: JMV heap size too low-> I solved setting the following in the jmeter.bat files in each jmeter instance: set HEAP=-Xms4g -Xmx4g set NEW=-XX:NewSize=4g -XX:MaxNewSize=4g some mistakes in the code that results in a continue unuseful usage of the garbage collector. So I remove from my test all the jmeter listeners. In particular I was using TableVisualizer, ViewResultsFullVisualizer, StatVisualizer, and GraphVisualizer. Anyway the problem persists. I really have no idea about how to solve it. I know 10 hours of test with 2600 pitch request could be a very heavy test, but I think there should be a way to perform this. I'm using EC2 m3.xlarge instance so I could even raise the heap size to 8G if it could be useful, or splitting the workload among even more clients since I'm using spot instances so I will not pay so much more, but since I have already doubled the number of client instance from 4 to 8 in order to solve the problem and is doesn't work I'm a little bit confused and I want to know r suggestions before continue to get more and more resources. Thank you a lot in advance.
I have a spring mvc app running on tomcat 8 on a remote CentOS 7 web server. When I click the links to certain url patterns that call certain JSPs, it gives 404 errors. The same war file is able to run on my local CentOS 7 devbox at localhost:8080 without throwing the 404 errors, and also runs in eclipse on my devbox using Run As..Run on Server, without throwing 404 errors. So why is the same war file throwing 404 errors on the server but not on the local devbox? I have confirmed that the JSP files are actually present on the server by typing cd /opt/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/jsp followed by ls -al, and also repeating for subdirectories of that folder. On my local devbox, all tomcat subdirectories and files are owned by root. On the remove server, some of the folders were owned by a user who is also a member of the wheel group. So I changed ownership of the webapps directory on the server to root, but the problem persists. What else can I try?
So was just going through ConcurrentHashMap and it seems to be a threadsafe implementation with a fail-safe iterator. The implementation of fail-safe iterators are created using copy of the data structures and hence this prevents the problem of Concurrent Modification would have introduced. But it adds a penalty of the added memory usage. How high is this penalty? Is this always going to be equal to the size of the data structure? Considering my plan to hold a lot of context in ConcurrentHashMap, it would really be detrimental for my application memory footprint to double suddenly if I iterate. Also if there are 'n' threads iterating the data structure at the same time, is the memory penalty 'n' times the size of the data structure? This seems to be a costly penalty to pay for Fail Safe iterators. If the penalty is off this order, can I prevent using the fail-safe iterators by combining fail-fast iterators with mutexes?
I decided to move my play framework project on a ubuntu machine. On localhost, the project ran perfectly, but on Ubuntu, I get the following issue: [RuntimeException: Malformed input around byte 455] I know this mean there is a charset problem (see here), but how can I manage it?

After this, when all operations are finished, I got this exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: removeAttribute: Session already invalidated at org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSession.removeAttribute(StandardSession.java:1262) at org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSession.removeAttribute(StandardSession.java:1237) at org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSessionFacade.removeAttribute(StandardSessionFacade.java:140) at com.system.PageServlet.handleJsp(PageServlet.java:670) at com.system.PageServlet.doRun(PageServlet.java:384) at com.system.PageServlet.doGet(PageServlet.java:172) at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:617) at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:717) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:290) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) at filters.ObjectsCacheFilter.doFilter(ObjectsCacheFilter.java:43) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:235) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) at filters.FilterCach.doFilter(FilterCach.java:80) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:235) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) at filters.SetCharacterEncodingFilter.doFilter(SetCharacterEncodingFilter.java:123) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:235) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:206) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke(StandardWrapperValve.java:233) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invoke(StandardContextValve.java:191) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHostValve.invoke(StandardHostValve.java:127) at com.googlecode.psiprobe.Tomcat60AgentValve.invoke(Tomcat60AgentValve.java:30) at org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:103) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngineValve.invoke(StandardEngineValve.java:109) at org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:293) at org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor.process(Http11Processor.java:861) at org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol$Http11ConnectionHandler.process(Http11Protocol.java:606) at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.JIoEndpoint$Worker.run(JIoEndpoint.java:489) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) EDIT: this is a code where I got the exception: session.removeAttribute("test1"); session.removeAttribute("test2"); Could someone help me?
I’m doing a research for my project about to select the best java-based MVC framework that fits the needs of my team to develop web apps. Play framework is at the moment the best choice; is really lightweight, and has a low learning curve because of its simplicity and friendly approach. I’m using Play Framework version 2.2.1 with Ebean. But there’s only one thing that got me stuck, let me describe my problem: My application has several DB servers configured because it can switch connection between them. But when one or more of them are down the play framework throws an exception at the first http request. It throws the exception even before executing my Controller action code. That’s not what I desire, I expect to have control over the exception and serve my index.html view with some cache data and some user friendly message. When Play receive the first http request then try to create a DB transaction and get a connection from the connection pool. I don’t want that. I want to control when Play should handle a transaction for me and avoid default transactions handle. Please if someone can help me I’ll be truly thankful.
I am trying to set up a large-scale REST services server. We're using Spring Boot 1.2.1 Spring 4.1.5, and Java 8. Our controllers are implementing @RestController and the standard @RequestMapping annotations. My problem is that Spring Boot sets up a default redirect for controller exceptions to "/error". From the docs: Spring Boot provides an /error mapping by default that handles all errors in a sensible way, and it is registered as a ‘global’ error page in the servlet container. Coming from years writing REST applications with Node.js, this is, to me, anything but sensible. Any exception a service endpoint generates should return in the response. I can't understand why you'd send a redirect to what is most likely an Angular or JQuery SPA consumer which is only looking for an answer and can't or won't take any action on a redirect. What I want to do is set up a global error handler that can take any exception - either purposefully thrown from a request mapping method or auto generated by Spring (404 if no handler method is found for the request path signature), and return a standard formatted error response (400, 500, 503, 404) to the client without any MVC redirects. Specifically, we are going to take the error, log it to NoSQL with a UUID, then return to the client the right HTTP error code with the UUID of the log entry in the JSON body. The docs have been vague on how to do this. It seems to me that you have to either create your own ErrorController implementation or use ControllerAdvice in some fashion, but all the examples I've see still include forwarding the response to some kind of error mapping, which doesn't help. Other examples suggest that you'd have to list every Exception type you want to handle instead of just listing "Throwable" and getting everything. Can anyone tell me what I missed, or point me in the right direction on how to do this without suggesting up the chain that Node.js would be easier to deal with?
I have a java maven project which I pack with maven-shaded as standalone runnable fat-jar. If I create the jar on my MacBook Pro it fails after some time (iMac and Linux). If I create the jar on my iMac it runs flawless on any system I am unaware of any differences between my two systems. Both java 8, Eclipse Luna, same project and pom configuration. I noticed some time ago that the size of the jars differs too depending on which system it was build which probably should also not be the case, right? I originally started debugging like crazy what is wrong with my code, but could/still can't find anything. I am wondering if this might be some maven problem? The fact that it runs if compiled on the iMac gives me at least a certain confidence that it is not a classical program bug. Has anyone made similar observations or has a hint for me what the cause of the problem could be?
if someone could help that would be amazing. This project is being started in the NetBeans IDE EE version that comes with GlassFish Server. I've used Lucene to make a searchable twitter index of ~5G and am getting the NoClassDefFoundError only when called from the server giving a 500 Page Error. The problem really confuses me, NetBeans is able to compile and run the code. When I call my functions from the same project in the IDE I'm able to use it perfectly. When I compile to a WebProject and launch it seems like GlassFish isn't able to find the files but I've made sure it has all the jars in the WAR file in the proper directories. I've tried this both manually adding all the library files and by using Maven. Neither have worked, I've even added classpaths to the files elsewhere and added the files to glassfishes /lib folder. Here is my setup. http://imgbin.org/images/22748.PNG
I get this specific message: ClassFormatError: Illegal field modifiers in class 0x100A. It seems like there is a lot of this going around: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=435664 https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434442 java.lang.ClassFormatError: Illegal field modifiers in class ClassFormateError from using switch statements in Java 8's defender methods Java 8 ClassFormatException for interface with static methods, but only when using assertions The program is a Swing app and runs fine from the command line using gradle. But it is hard to debug things this way and the error moves around. I need to use Java 1.8. Is there any kind of workaround? Edit: IntelliJ community and netbeans work. but i have poor vision. Edit 2: Now it's failing on almost all of the junit tests. this is most annoying. Edit 3: Trying mars m6. ran into this fixed that problem (see my comment) by making a new project and copying src/ into it. swing app seems to work at first glance. Thanks.
I have a problem with adding sites to the java security exception list. According to the documentation (http://java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml) the exception list does exactly what I want. Stop this stupid security message and let me use the application which I KNOW is secure. Following setup: Ubuntu Development machine, running application server with a little java applet on the login page (Do not ask why, I don't know thats how the application works). If I use my local browser everything works fine. But I have to test the site with Windows in an virtual box VM. I have an IE8/Win7 image from modern.ie running. I installed the latest java on this VM and every time I try to login the Java applet is blocked because of my security settings (yeah.. "my"). I added the hostname of my machine to the exception list in the java control panel (in the vm of course). But this does not change anything it. The application runs at http://myhost:1234/APPLICATION-NAME I've added every possible combination to the exception list like: http://myhost http://myhost:1234 (with and without trailing /) http://myhost:1234/APPLICATION-Name (with and without trailing /). nothing worked. Does anyone know if this exception list thing still works as stated on the FAQ page from oracle? Why is there not a button named "oracle I know what I'm doing".
I'm trying to reproduce a behaviour of a java applet when it sends a print job and a javax.print.PrintException: Printer is not accepting job exception is thrown. I'm trying to follow the steps in the first comment of this issue of open JDK. My question is: How do I place a printer in an error state. It would be awesome if I could do it with PDFCreator for instance or some other virtual printer I could easily test. Quoting the steps: Make the printer go to an error condition. The easiest way to do it is to disconnect network cable from your laptop/desktop if you have a network printer or to power off your printer if it's local. I disconnected the network cable from my laptop and then sent the job to my network printer only to receive a different exception: java.awt.print.PrinterException: The RPC server is unavailable. I've tried fiddling with restarts of the spooler service while I paused the printer or restricted the print times, trying to get a print job in an error state. I also tried opening the shd files trying to edit them to force the error state on the jobs but I could not find out how, nor it would do anything as the starting of the spooler service would clear the folder... Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
I need a little help with my JAVA code. Basically I have to make a chessboard, so it has to be a JFrame, JPanel, 64 buttons in a grid layout (8 by 8) and put the 16 chess pieces image on the buttons. Now here is the problem I have this working in one file but to make it harder, I have to split the code between two files. So the GUI (JPanel, JFrame) have to be in one file and the code for the buttons and images have to be in another file. This is where I am struggling as I have split my code between the two files, I need to reference the class called ChessSquare in the file ChessBoard. But in my code for the buttons which is a for loop of 8, with another for loop of 8 and then they get added to the JFrame, but as there is no JFrame reference outside of the GUI file, so this prevents my code from working. How do I reference the JFrame called 'a' in the second file for the buttons?
I am new to ElasticSearch, but already in trouble. My configuration: Windows 7 Enterprise 64 bits 8 Gb RAM I am unsuccessful at simply starting the instance, using elasticsearch.bat : Error occurred during initialization of VM Could not reserve enough space for object heap Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine. Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit. Adter exploring SO forums as well as ElasticSearch support pages, here is what I tried: setting min and/or max heap memory (using SET ES_MAX_MEM and SET ES_MIN_MEM on the command line before calling elasticsearch.bat) to various values, from 256m/512m to 256m/3g ==> no change in error message setting heap size (using SET ES_HEAP_SIZE on the command line before calling elasticsearch.bat) to various values, from 256m to 3g ==> no change in error message uninstalled my Java 7 environment and fresh installed Java 8 64 bits (checked through java -version on the command line) ==> no change in error message Surprisingly enough, I can't seem to find any logging information (no 'logs' directory present in %ES_HOME% where the elasticsearch.org documentation states it should be...) Would anyone point me to the right direction to get the thing up and running? Thanks a lot
I'm working with EMF on a non-plugin, AppEngine Maven project that has the org.eclipse.core.runtime AND org.eclipse.ocl.ecore dependencies. The project runs perfectly when on the local server (I am using JDK 7). However, when deployed to GAE, I get the following two errors, sometimes one, sometimes the other: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.ocl.ecore.internal.OCLStandardLibraryImpl Both classes are indeed present in the JARs in the target folder's lib directory (also unzipped and checked the JARs). Here's how the dependencies look in the POM: <dependency> <groupId>org.eclipse.core</groupId> <artifactId>org.eclipse.core.runtime</artifactId> <version>${version.core.runtime}</version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.eclipse.ocl</groupId> <artifactId>org.eclipse.ocl.ecore</artifactId> <version>${version.oclecore}</version> </dependency> Where could the problem lie? Am I missing something obvious? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
I want to create excel file with apache poi, but I have error GC overhead limit exceeded. On the FAQ apache poi I read: (http://poi.apache.org/faq.html#faq-N10109) Apache POI ships with a few programs and a few example programs, which can be used to do some basic performance checks. For testing file generation, the class to use is in the examples package, SSPerformanceTest. Run SSPerformanceTest with arguments of the writing type (HSSF, XSSF or SXSSF), the number rows, the number of columns, and if the file should be saved. If you can't run that with 50,000 rows and 50 columns in all of HSSF, XSSF and SXSSF in under 3 seconds (ideally a lot less!), the problem is with your environment. I run test with parameters XSSF 50000 rows, 50 columns, 1 (create file) and have error GC overhead limit. Why? I tried to increse memory, but it isn't work for me. I use YourKit Java Profiler for search reason. And error was in cell.setCellValue when row = 2036. I don't know why test from FAQ didn't work for me. Also I test for SXSSF and test expanded for 11 seconds, not for 3 seconds. I read that: Try setting each object equal to null at the very end of the loop, before it loops back to the top. When you create an object be it a row, cell or sheet you need to explicitly destroy them when finished with. The system does not do this automatically. If this is not carried out it can lead to unwanted storage usage and JAVA leaks. It isn't work. I want to know how resolved this problem? What's wrong with apache poi SSPerformanceTest which recommended in FAQ? What reason of this error?

Good afternoon, I have a Bitnami virtual machine with JasperServer 5.6.0, with a report that connects to Oracle. The query report, accessed using fixed parameters in a dbms as DbVisualizer takes about 6/7 seconds, but Jasper takes more than 60 seconds, causing a 500 error. As additional data in a JasperServer installed on windows, it takes about 2 minutes consultation, but no errors. Has anyone experienced something similar? Errors that I get are: In the jasperserver site HTML response error code: 500, error HTML response was: Internal Server Error The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

I am trying to track down the cause of a PermGen error that does not behave like ones I have encountered before. It occurs when hot deploying (yes I know) into a custom container (yes I know). When running on a vm with CentOS release 6.6 (Final) "Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.76-b04, mixed mode)" A PermGen error occurs reliably on 5 redeploys. Running on my Ubuntu 14.04.1 machine with the same version of java I can reploy 100+ times without issue. The test for the above is fully automated so all JVM flags, versions, code etc are identical. The hot deployed code starts a JMS listener. I had initially assumed that the issue would be a ThreadLocal created behind the scenes by the jms code holding onto a class reference however 1) In the heap dump I do not see classloaders being retained - they seem to be being GC's as expected 2) Permgen is never exhausted on an identical jvm runnning on ubuntu (as discussed above) It appears that the issue in some way relates to the underlying os. Any ideas of what could cause this?
I'm new to ANE-Facebook, however I've got positive experience with some other Freshplanet's ANEs. The subject question is: Is my configuration wrong or is the issue caused by ANE's code? This AIR app stops right after calling openSessionWithReadPermissions For obvious reasons, the text bellow and attached log file have values replaced as follows: MyNumericAppId - my app id ('0234XXXXXXXXX') air.com.mydomain.myapp.debug - my app package (air.com.recxxxxx.xxxxx.debug) I've configured manifest and extension sections in application.xml according to freshplanet's readme and howto: <application> <id>com.mydomain.myapp</id> <!-- debug is being added automatically --> [...] <android> <manifestAdditions><![CDATA[ <manifest android:installLocation="auto"> [...] <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/> <application> <activity android:name="com.facebook.LoginActivity"/> <activity android:name="com.freshplanet.ane.AirFacebook.LoginActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"></activity> <activity android:name="com.freshplanet.ane.AirFacebook.ShareDialogActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"></activity> <activity android:name="com.freshplanet.ane.AirFacebook.ShareOGActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"></activity> <activity android:name="com.freshplanet.ane.AirFacebook.WebDialogActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"></activity> </application> </manifest> ]]></manifestAdditions> </android> [...] <extensions> <extensionID>com.freshplanet.AirFacebook</extensionID> </extensions> </application> I've configured app facebook side (generated hashes based on certificate and password I've created earlier). I call methods in order: trace("Facebook.isSupported", Facebook.isSupported); Facebook.getInstance().init(MyNumericAppId,false); Facebook.getInstance().logEnabled = true; trace("Facebook.getInstance().isSessionOpen" Facebook.getInstance().isSessionOpen); Facebook.getInstance().closeSessionAndClearTokenInformation(); Facebook.getInstance().openSessionWithReadPermissions(["public_profile", "user_friends"],aneSessionResult); The Issue: Method aneSessionResult is never executed. Application stops immediately after calling openSessionWithReadPermissions and exits on confirmation. No ActionScript level error is being thrown. Delaying or triggering this method on user's input event - gives the very same result. I'm attaching full info-level, not filtered log file, captured from start of the app till the crash occurrence (replaced app id and package). Once again: Is my configuration wrong or is it something to do with ANE itself? Thank you P.S. either me or SO can't handle code formatting for this post. Apologies.
I've been seeing an odd problem with a JNLP Java desktop application which uses several databases (all on the same server). It'll throw these java.net.SocketPermission" "server.domain.com:1433" errors while opening a database connection (Microsoft SQL Server), but only very rarely, and only in one particular section of code and connecting to one particular database (and I do mean "database", not a specific "table"). Never has this happened with connections to any of the other databases residing on that server (It has around 2 dozen databases with thousands of tables). I've never actually been able to catch it on my development machine, but we have a user (not specific user, it varies) hit it once about every 3-4 weeks. I'm really not sure what to look for on this. I've already confirmed permissions and code to the best of my ability. Is there another class of issue I should look for?
I am doing a practice question from Data Structures Practice The Question 1.Linear Probing will (circle one): i.gradually degrade in performance as more values are inserted ii.May not find a location on the next insertion iii.None of the above 2.Quadratic Probing will (circle one): i.gradually degrade in performance as more values are inserted ii.May not find a location on the next insertion iii.None of the above According to the answer key(from the link), the answer to 1 is i and the answer to 2 is ii. I agree with the answer question 1. Linear probing will explore all possibilities and wrap to the beginning of the hashtable if needed. Therefore it will find a location on the next insertion. If you insert a bunch of values that map to the same bucket or near one bucket, clustering will result and performance will degrade. I understand why the the answer to question 2 isn't i. Quadratic increment probs by different increments to avoid the clustering issue. However can some explain the intution behind how quadratic probing "may not find a location on the next insertion" A quadratic probing function is defined with (from Quadratic Probing) nth probe being ((h(k) + n2) mod TableSize) until the probe hits a zero(unoccupied) From what I learned in my other question Quadratic Probing, it is possible for a quadratic probe to hit every bucket. Like the linear probe, the quadratic probe should also wrap tot he beginning of the hashtable if needed. Why then in this question, can a quadratic probe not find a location on the next insertion while a linear probe can?
I am using Eclipse for Android Application Development. It was working fine but I am facing an issue from last two days. I have tried every possible solution to resolve that issue. Let me explain the issue first. Whenever I run or debug a project (any project from work space), it throws error. It shown a crash error on device "Unfortunately, App has stopped." Then I tried to create a new project. I haven't done any changes in this new project and clicked to launch it on my device. It is also showing the same error. I don't know why it is behaving like that. I am in need of your help and will really appreciate your help in this matter.

We have a virtual server running Windows Server 2012 R2. On Friday the version of java was updated from 1.8.0_27 to 1.8.0_40. As far as I know, this was the only change made. Since that time, I can run java directly from the command line or in batch files, but previously working powershell scripts that use Start-Process to start java, e.g. $process = Start-Process -FilePath c:\ProgramData\Oracle\java\javapath\java.exe -ArgumentList $report_args -PassThru -Wait give the error "Start-Process : This command cannot be run completely because the system cannot find all the information required." The java executable actually is started and finishes its task correctly, but in the meantime the powershell script has gone down the path to reporting the error. System.Diagnostics.Process.Start (in C#) is also reporting a failure when starting java. Any ideas on things to look into for the message "Start-Process : This command cannot be run completely because the system cannot find all the information required."?
Using İntelliJIdea, I Downloaded my project from Subversion for 12 times. Deleted .m2/repository for 7-8 times. Reimported, downloaded source for 15 times. Tried every possibilities but still cannot run my project. Here is my Maven run profile and project hierarchy and here this is my maven output [ERROR] Plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:2.5 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Cannot access central (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2) in offline mode and the artifact org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:jar:2.5 has not been downloaded from it before. -> [Help 1] http://paste.ubuntu.com/10613835/ There is nothing wrong with project or maven files.

Our test environment has a variety of integration tests that rely on middleware (CMS platform, underlying DB, Elasticsearch index). They're automated and we manage our middleware with Docker, so we don't have issues with unreliable networks. However, sometimes our DB crashes and our test fails. The problem is that the detection of this failure is through a litany of org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException messages. These come about via a timeout. When that happens, we end up with hundreds of tests failing with this exception, each one taking many seconds to fail. As a result, it takes an age for our tests to complete. Indeed, we generally just kill these builds manually when we realise they are done. My question: In a Maven-driven Java testing environment, is there a way to direct the build system to watch out for specific kinds of Exceptions and kill the whole process, should they arrive (or reach some kind of threshold)? We could watchdog our containers and kill the build process that way, but I'm hoping there's a cleaner way to do it with maven.
I've been looking around for something to break down my request when an exception is thrown. I have a file upload in my jsp which can't be more than 2MB. There is jsp validation but there has to be an extra safety for when internet explorer 8 or 9 is being used because the file API is not supported there or when javascript is being disabled client side. I have a CommonMultipartResolver from spring which correctly handles my request when uploading a bigger file (it throws a MaxUploadSizeExceededException). When my ExceptionResolver handles the request and sends back a ModelAndView. The real problem occurs when I upload a file which is for example 4GB. The exception is thrown by the multipartResolver, the exception is caught by the exceptionhandler and a modelAndView is trying to be returned. This trying to return the modelAndView takes ages to return because the request is being handled and the file has to be fully uploaded. I want to break down my request and stop handling the file upload, someone with experience in doing this?
In my project “flexicore” I am facing one problem. There are some jar specification errors are there in the project.

I came across this peculiar case where my ANT Mail Task is working absolutely fine ( with attachments) when I am run my test in local. But when the same tests runs from Jenkins, the ANT mail tasks fail with below error - [mail] Failed to initialise MIME mail: javax/mail/MessagingException When I change the encoding for any mail task as plain (encoding="plain") the mail task works & I get the mail BUT without any attachment. I read it somewhere that by default for ANT mail task - encoding="auto". & changing it to encoding="plain" makes it work!! Mail without the attachment(which is my test report ZIP) is "job not done" for me. Just to repeat my self, when I run my test locally I am getting mail with attachment, but when the same code runs form Jenkins ANT mail task just fails. Here are the options that i have tried & still found no solution - Have tried to change the encoding to "mime" as well but found no luck!! Have added all the required JAR Files like - activation.jar, ant-javamail.jar,javax.mail.jar, mail.jar, mailapi.jar, smtp.jar, dsn.jar, gimap.jar, imap.jar, pop3.jar, It will be great help, If anyone can help me in explaining, what is it I am NOT doing correctly.
I have a service with several AIDL files. To one, I just added a custom object that I defined in a .java file as part of the interface as an "in" parameter, and included the .aidl for it with the parcelable declaration. The build fails with an error stating that the custom Parcelable java class is undefined. Any idea why Android Studio (or gradle from the command line) would be ignoring the java class definition? The java class implements the Parcelable interface as well as the static CREATOR. The build process generates the java files from the aidl files, but the original java class is not copied into that directory. While I concede that this may not be how the Android Studio build process works, it is the way that the android-x86 project builds. Surely someone else has seen where a Parcelable object is not being built by Android Studio, and found a solution...?
I want to debug a webapp in eclipse. I get to the point where tomcat and the webapp are ran inside of eclipse in debug mode, but then breakpoints in the webapp code have no effect. Details The webapp is a maven artifact and I use the m2e plugin in eclipse to bridge between maven and eclipse. I've managed to start the tomcat server from within eclipse. The webapp is started in tomcat nicely, also in debug mode if I choose so: in eclipse, right-click project Run As > Maven build... (NOT "Maven build") a window opens. In the text field "Goals", enter "tomcat7:run" click Apply click Run The tomcat server starts up running and its stdlog is printed to a window within eclipse. I can also stop it conveniently and start it again in debug mode. So far, that's what I want and what I expect. Problem I set a breakpoint in the code of my webapp and restart tomcat in debug mode from within eclipse. Now, the breakpoint isn't active: It doesn't have that little tickmark that active breakpoints have and I know the code is executed, but it doesn't stop at the breakpoint.
I have run into a strange problem when coding a simple UDP broadcast app for Android. Basically my app wants to broadcast a stream of data to devices on the local network. Each UDP packet has a number which is incremented sequentially so I know when a packet is lost. When I did a test, I noticed that around 80 percent of my packets got lost. Now I know UDP is lossy, but this is insane on a LAN. So I coded the very same sender on JRE7 and launched it. The very same code had near zero percent loss. When I switched to unicast (simply changing the destination IP address, no code change) on Android, I got a 0 percent loss rate. With Unicast Im a little worried about the scalability of the application. Does anyone know if there some known bug in Android which causes problems while sending multicast datagrams? Im fairly certain it is not the receiver at fault as I use the same one for unicast and broadcast receival. Thanks for your thoughts.
Been looking at similar answers and so far mine hasn't replicated the same so I'm posting my question on here. I tried my application on my other computer (same file and everything, just different IP address) and it works fine. The second I move it to my tomcat server (which is running fine, hits server startup and everything) it displays this when I debug in chrome: WebSocket connection to 'ws://192.168.1.12:8080/WebMobileGroupChatServer/chat?name=asdf' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 404 I've seen the same error code in other questions, pointing to duplicate api's in WEB-INF or in the xml but this doesn't have a web.xml, and it works fine on the eclipse server on my desktop, but when I run the server on my RPi, it won't run. I can make it to the tomcat home page, so I know it's set up correctly. I just need help finding what the problem is. Do I need to go through the ./configure process for installation? I don't remember having to do that last time when it worked before, but let me know asap. Been a problem for a while now.
I'm running certain process that inserts new elements in DB from a for loop. I'm using JPA (Eclipselink), and sometimes there's a problem with the transation status. This is the case: One of the INSERTS doesn't work (Primary Key duplicated) After that, all the inserts will fail (Exception Description: Transaction is currently active). for (Element l:e){ try{ //Should I add: if(!em.getTransaction().isActive()) em.getTransaction().begin(); em.createNativeQuery("INSERT INTO...").executeUpdate(); em.getTransaction().commit(); } catch(Exception ep) { //right now I don't do anything here } } I get that what is happening is that, since the commit in 1) didn't work, the transaction didn't finish, so the next em.getTransaction().begin() will find an already active transaction. I have two ideas: A) Before em.getTransaction().begin(), check if the transcation is active, and only if it is not, call begin(); otherwise, create query and commit. B) Do something within the catch block. And here's my doubt... Should I call clear()? flush()? close()? Which one looks better? Thanks!
I am building an artificial intelligence agent for an existing board game and having difficulty figuring out how to debug this Java code in Eclipse. The existing game consists of a server that is run and listens for client connection. Once two clients connect, the game is automatically run to completion based on the AI in the client. I have source files for all elements. I would like to be able to debug one of the clients so I can work on it. The issue is that, if I simply run the server and connect the first client, then debug the second, Eclipse skips all breakpoints. If I run the server as a remote debugging server, then run a remote debugging configuration on a client in Eclipse, I can step through the server code, but once it's waiting for the second client to connect, it just stops. At this point, I can't figure out how to connect the second client. How can I debug an application with this configuration? A server, one connected client and my second client that I want debugging information for. Thank you!
We are using Arjuna/Narayana XA transaction support for a project so we can have a single distributed transaction that spans multiple databases at the same time. One of our databases is MySQL. Like many other databases, MySQL throws a certain type of error when an optimistic locking error is detected, which the application is supposed to interpret as "your transaction failed due to optimistic locking, but it will probably succeed if you just try it again so why don't you do that?" Prior to using XA, this was not a problem, as it was easy to retry the transaction when an optimistic locking failure occurred - just check the type of exception, and retry if appropriate. Now, however, Arjuna is treating the optimistic locking error as a fatal error just like any other, and there's no way for our code outside the overall XA transaction to know that the XA transaction is likely to succeed if retried (the exception is the same either way). We don't want to retry every failed transaction, only the ones that failed due to optimistic locking. But we can't tell the difference. Has anyone encountered this problem scenario with XA transactions, and if so how did you solve it?
I have something of a general question about all the possible causes for getting UnsatisfiedLinkError when doing Java/JNI type stuff. Specifically, I am working with a Java project (JLibav) that I'm trying to build for Mac (Linux works). So, I'm obviously getting that error; however, the library does get found and I am able to call other functions that are in the library!? And, yes, I verified (via fprintf statement) that the function was being entered. Also, using nm, I have verified that the symbol in question is indeed there. So, what else could possibly be goind on? I did build the C/C++ Libav being used by JLibav, and when I configured the library (Libav), I did select "enable PIC" (position-independent code). So, what else could cause that specific error? Also, saw another function that was causing the same error, but when I debug and step into the code, the error is not hit! Timing issue? This is starting to seem like a threading issue or something, but how could that cause UnsatisfiedLinkError? That doesn't make sense. Thanks in advance ... Any help will be greatly appreciated!!
I have found a few related questions on this, but they're all related to Intellij or on Mac OS. I'm on Windows 8.1 and using Eclipse: Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers. Version: Luna Service Release 2 (4.4.2) Build id: 20150219-0600 Maven 3.3.1 I've set up the "Run As" parameters as directed for the course but I get the following error message when I try to run: -Dmaven.multiModuleProjectDirectory system propery is not set.

I'm producing an app using Eclipse on a Mac, and am using File Export to produce a Runnable Jar. The Runnable Jar files that I produce run happily on my Mac and on another Mac. But on two different Windows machines, they don't. I've looked around for answers, and have tried the following: 1) When I double click on the jar icon nothing happens. 2) When I type java -jar Luscinia.jar at the Command Prompt, I get: "Could not find or load main class lusc.net.github.Luscinia" 3) When I type java -cp Luscinia.jar lusc.net.github.Luscinia I get the same error message. The JRE on one of the Windows machine (at least) is up to date (1.8.0_40). So is the JRE on the Mac. The file structure inside my jar does indeed have Luscinia.class nested inside github, net and lusc directories. The manifest contains the lines: Class-Path: . Main-Class: lusc.net.github.Luscinia (& it contains two blank lines at the bottom) Other jar's are working well on the two Windows machines. And to emphasise again, it works perfectly well on two Mac machines. Any ideas? I checked whether the EOL character had an effect. Changing it to Windows \r\n didn't have any effect. (Thanks to RealSkeptic for the idea).
I'm a student doing a project on Big Data using Cassandra. I have to bulk load quite a bit of data for my project. My rows are quite large at 470 cols. I'm trying to utilize a SSTable + JMX loader strategy. Whenever I try to load the SSTables to my localhost pc I get an OOM error. I'm not sure what to do and I've worked so hard -- its 4:15 am right now -- I've googled the problem but I can't seem to get it to work. I'm launching my program in Eclipse, so that might make a difference.

I ported my app from Eclipse to Android Studio, and now my app won't run. Just to be clear, I did not export from Eclipse. I created a new project in Android Studio, and manually cut/pasted every class in my project. I am running Android Studio on a new Macbook Pro - Yosemite. I am having some issues running my app, even though it compiles. From what I can see, my problem might be that I am using JDK 1.8. Well, I cannot figure out how the heck to get JDK 6. Here is the error I get when I run the project in Android Studio Error:Execution failed for task ':app:preDexDebug'. com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_40.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 1 When I scroll up in the Gradle Event Log, I see this error: com.android.dx.cf.iface.ParseException: bad class file magic (cafebabe) or version (0034.0000) In addition to the app not running, Android Studio freezes a lot! Again, is this because of the version of Java I have installed?
Since there is a lot of ambiguity about this, can we come up with some clear, simple and easy to use rules? Here is a first try, these three rules should be sufficient for all cases. First rule is based on the common principle that implementation details of the method should not be exposed to the caller: Rule 1: Checked exception should not expose implementation details to the caller: You can test it this way: If you completely change the implementation but still expect the method to fulfill its contract (like in refactoring) would it still make sense to throw the exception? If yes then it should be a Checked exception because it is not implementation detail but part of use case the method fullfills. If no then the exception should be unchecked because it is an implementation detail which should not be exposed to the caller. If based on Rule 1 the exception should be checked then apply the Rule 2: Rule 2: Since checked exception is part of the method contract, violation of the method's contract can't be a checked exception. For example this method executes sql query from its param: executeSqlQuery(String sqlQuery) If caller provides string that is not an sql query then he violated input conditions of the method and the resulting exception must be unchecked. If based on Rule 2 the exception still seems like checked, apply rule three which checks whether the method is following another best practice: single responsibility principle Rule 3: Method should do just one thing. For example method List.get(int index) is correctly doing just one thing: returning desired element from the list. And not trying to also fulfill another common use cases: check whether the element is present. On the other hand method findById(Long id) throws RecordNotFoundException is incorrectly trying to mix these two functions and by that forces all callers to always consider the use case when record is not found even though they know that the record exists. Is some rule missing or can we simplify and clarify the rules further? BACKGROUND: There are many different views on this topic. There is quite a lot of proponents of "radical" solutions like never to use a checked exception (some java books or designers of C#) or that almost everything should be a checked exception (IOException in java.io package or SQLException in JDBC). And at least same number of views suggest to use both types but are offering subjective and ambiguous rules for deciding between them which without a lengthy explanation that is often missing instead of helping just bring more confusion (eg: If it is reasonable for the caller to recover from the exception than it should be checked. Is trying the call again a reasonable recovery? For some clients it may be. Words reasonable and recover are too ambiguous.)
I have two object types: message and template. First I create a template, save it, then create a message, set message.template = template and then commit. But -sometimes- I get an constraint fail exception, saying "Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails" - foreign key of message object which references template object. Does Hİbernate have a commit order? Maybe trying to save message object first and -boom- template object is not committed yet. I don't have any other explanation of this error because this code works usually fine but sometimes error happens. edit: This occurs in a large block of code i just cannot copy-paste it sorry. Pseudo code summary: Template template = new Template(); template.setTemplateName... etc ...etc My DAO class saves template object. Not committing, saved in session. Then similar scenary happens for message object, created, foreign keys, attributes are set and then saved. There happens the constraint fail. I even tried to get that template object before i create and save message object to see if it exists (Template badTemplate = -my DAO class for template object . getByID() ), i can system.out "this template object's id is " + badTemplate.getTemplateId() + " and name is " + badTemplate.getTemplateName()" without any problem, but this does not prevent the fail. This code is used in an web service, i can get a successful return and my friend on another computer gets error.
I am getting the "Protocol Violation". I have an application running on RedHat Linux.The database and the application are co-resident on the machine. Oracle version used: Oracle 11g R2 (11.2.0.3.0) JDBC Driver used: 12.1.0.1 Java used: jdk1.7.0.65 32-bit I have come across many forums where this error has been pointed out to be a driver issue but in all those forums the oracle version used was higher and the driver version were older and changing the driver resolved the issue.But in my case the Oracle version is lower but driver version is higher.So , in this case will the higher version of the the driver could be a problem? Also, this protocol violation can also arise when the maximum number of connections on the DB is reached ?

In my application, I am using Log4j2 in Async mode (Async logger using Disruptor), can some one pls tell me how to handle an exception that happens in the logging process. Logging is very critical for my application, I don't want to miss a single log statement. If something goes wrong with logging, that needs to be alerted immediately. As per Apache Log4j page, suggests to use ExceptionHandler, but I couldn't find a helping topic on how to use this. Error handling. If a problem happens during the logging process and an exception is thrown, it is less easy for an asynchronous logger or appender to signal this problem to the application. This can partly be alleviated by configuring an ExceptionHandler, but this may still not cover all cases. For this reason, if logging is part of your business logic, for example if you are using Log4j as an audit logging framework, we would recommend to synchronously log those audit messages. (Note that you can still combine them and use asynchronous logging for debug/trace logging in addition to synchronous logging for the audit trail.) Waiting for suggestions.

I stored all my projects in the workspace "JAVA CODE" but once the project did not launch and I decided to save everything in another work space "java for assignments". I wrote the entire project in the new work space "java for assignments" (I think I did). However, when I started debugging my codes I got the msg: Source not found. Edit Source look up path. Hence, I checked where the project was stored and I found that (very strangely) even though I was always opening and working in the new work space "java for assignments" Eclipse had stored everything in the old workspace "JAVA CODE".But when I open Eclipse with work space "JAVA CODE" I dont see any project. In short, the workspace in which i am working does not store the projects and the workspace that is storing the project does not show them when I open it in eclipse. I have been trying to figure out a solution since few hours but no luck. I will appreciate any help. Many thanks..!!!

What does the ^ operator do in Java? What function does the ^ (caret) operator serve in Java? When I try this: ...it gives me: for n = 5, returns 0 for n = 4, returns 1 for n = 6, returns 3 ...so I guess it doesn't perform exponentiation. But what is it then?
Why doesn't the JVM cache JIT compiled code? The canonical JVM implementation from Sun applies some pretty sophisticated optimization to bytecode to obtain near-native execution speeds after the code has been run a few times. The question is, why isn't this compiled code cached to disk for use during subsequent uses of the same function/class. As it stands, every time a program is executed, the JIT compiler kicks in afresh, rather than using a pre-compiled version of the code. Wouldn't adding this feature add a significant boost to the initial run time of the program, when the bytecode is essentially being interpreted?
Should I instantiate instance variables on declaration or in the constructor? Is there any advantage for either approach? Example 1: Example 2:
How to write console output to a txt file I have tried to write the console output to a txt file using this code suggestion (http://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread23883.html#) however I was not successful.

Which programming languages can I use on Android Dalvik? In theory, Dalvik executes any virtual machine byte code, created for example with the compilers of AspectJ ColdFusion Clojure Groovy JavaFX Script JRuby Jython Rhino Scala Are there already working versions of bytecode compilers for Dalvik available for other languages than Java?
Hibernate Criteria returns children multiple times with FetchType.EAGER I have an Order class that has a list of OrderTransactions and I mapped it with a one-to-many Hibernate mapping like so: These Orders also have a field orderStatus, which is used for filtering with the following Criteria: This works and the result is as expected. Now here is my question: Why, when I set the fetch type explicitly to EAGER, do the Orders appear multiple times in the resulting list? How would I have to change my Criteria code to reach the same result with the new setting?
Problem unmarshalling parcelables I've got a few classes that implement Parcelable and some of these classes contain each other as properties. I'm marshalling the classes into a Parcel to pass them between activities. Marshalling them TO the Parcel works fine, but when I try to unmarshall them I get the following error: The LayoverType class (where it's failing): readParcelable writeParcelable writeLong readLong for implementing Parcelable it's failing here Here's the LocationType class: writeString writeInt readDouble readInt writeDouble readString for implementing Parcelable Update 2: As far as I can tell it's failing at the following bit of code (from Parcel's source): Why is it not able to find the class? It both exists and implements Parcelable.
Method has the same erasure as another method in type Why is it not legal to have those two methods in the same class? I get the compilation error Method add(Set) has the same erasure add(Set) as another method in type Test. while I can work around it, I was wondering why javac doesn't like this. I can see that in many cases, the logic of those two methods would be very similar and could be replaced by a single method, but this is not always the case. This is extra annoying if you want to have two constructors that takes those arguments because then you can't just change the name of one of the constructors.
Apache Tomcat Not Showing in Eclipse Server Runtime Environments I have tomcat 5.5 installed, running and verifiable at http://localhost:8080/. The Tomcat menu option appears in the Eclipse menu bar and I can start and stop Tomcat from there. In Eclipse, it does not show as a Server Runtime Environment in Window - Preferences - Server - Runtime Environments, nor does it appear in the list of environments that can be added when I click the "Add" button. All I see is the J2EE Runtime Library. Edit: Running on Windows XP. Eclipse version is 3.5.1
Override back button to act like home button On pressing the back button, I'd like my application to go into the stopped state, rather than the destroyed state. In the Android docs it states: ...not all activities have the behavior that they are destroyed when BACK is pressed. When the user starts playing music in the Music application and then presses BACK, the application overrides the normal back behavior, preventing the player activity from being destroyed, and continues playing music, even though its activity is no longer visible How do I replicate this functionality in my own application? I think there must be three possibilities... Capture the back button press (as below) and then call whatever method(s) the home button calls. Capture the back button press and then spoof a home button press. Capture the back button press, then start an Activity of the home screen, effectively putting my application's Activity into the stopped state. Edit: I know about services and am using one in the application to which this problem is related. This question is specifically about putting the Activity into the stopped state rather than the destroyed state on pressing the back button.
Overriding private methods in Java As succinctly described here, overriding private methods in Java is invalid because a parent class's private methods are "automatically final, and hidden from the derived class". My question is largely academic. How is it not a violation of encapsulation to not allow a parent's private method to be "overridden" (ie, implemented independently, with the same signature, in a child class)? A parent's private method cannot be accessed or inherited by a child class, in line with principles of encapsulation. It is hidden. So, why should the child class be restricted from implementing its own method with the same name/signature? Is there a good theoretical foundation for this, or is this just a pragmatic solution of some sort? Do other languages (C++ or C#) have different rules on this?
What is the difference between java and core java? When looking at job openings on-line, I noticed that some openings required knowledge of "core Java". What is core java and how is different from java?
How to make ThreadPoolExecutor's submit() method block if it is saturated? I want to create a ThreadPoolExecutor such that when it has reached its maximum size and the queue is full, the sumbit() method blocks when trying to add new tasks. Do I need to implement a custom RejectedExecutionHandler for that or is there an existing way to do this using standard java library?
Override Java System.currentTimeMillis for testing time sensitive code Is there a way, either in code or with JVM arguments, to override the current time, as presented via System.currentTimeMillis, other than manually changing the system clock on the host machine? A little background: We have a system that runs a number of accounting jobs that revolve much of their logic around the current date (ie 1st of the month, 1st of the year, etc) Unfortunately, a lot of the legacy code calls functions such as new Date() or Calendar.getInstance(), both of which eventually call down to System.currentTimeMillis. For testing purposes, right now, we are stuck with manually updating the system clock to manipulate what time and date the code thinks that the test is being run. So my question is: Is there a way to override what is returned by System.currentTimeMillis? For example, to tell the JVM to automatically add or subtract some offset before returning from that method? Thanks in advance!
JPA getSingleResult() or null I have an insertOrUpdate method which inserts an Entity when it doesn't exist or update it if it does. To enable this, I have to findByIdAndForeignKey, if it returned null insert if not then update. The problem is how do I check if it exists? So I tried getSingleResult. But it throws an exception if the but getSingleResult throws an Exception. Thanks

In what order do static/instance initializer blocks in Java run? Say a project contains several classes, each of which has a static initializer block. In what order do those blocks run? I know that within a class, such blocks are run in the order they appear in the code. I've read that it's the same across classes, but some sample code I wrote disagrees with that. I used this code: println Instance init block Constructor Static init block Static init block Instance init block Constructor Constructor Static init block Instance init block and got this output: START static - grandparent static - parent static - child instance - grandparent constructor - grandparent instance - parent constructor - parent instance - child constructor - child END The obvious answer from that is that parents' blocks run before their children's, but that could just be a coincidence and doesn't help if two classes aren't in the same hierarchy. EDIT: I modified my example code by appending this to LoadTest.java: println Constructor Instance init block Static init block As implied by the class name, I never referenced the new class anywhere. The new program produced the same output as the old one.

@AspectJ pointcut for all methods of a class with specific annotation I want to monitor all public methods of all Classes with specified annotation (say @Monitor) (note: Annotation is at class level). What could be a possible pointcut for this? Note: I am using @AspectJ style Spring AOP.
JPA OneToMany not deleting child I have a problem with a simple @OneToMany mapping between a parent and a child entity. All works well, only that child records are not deleted when I remove them from the collection. The parent: The child: If I now delete and child from the childs Set, it does not get deleted from the database. I tried nullifying the child.parent reference, but that did not work either. The entities are used in a web application, the delete happens as part of an Ajax request. I don't have a list of deleted childs when the save button is pressed, so I can't delete them implicitly.

C# developers learning Java, what are the biggest differences one may overlook? For c# developers that are staring out to learn Java, are there any big underlying differences between the two languages that should be pointed out? Maybe some people may assume things to be the same, but there are some import aspects that shouldn't be overlooked? (or you can really screw up!) Maybe in terms of OOP constructs, the way GC works, references, deployment related, etc.

When and why JPA entities should implement Serializable interface? The question is in the title. Below I just described some of my thoughts and findings. When I had very simple domain model (3 tables without any relations) all my entities did NOT implement Serializable. But when domain model became more complex I got RuntimeException which said that one of my entities didn't implement Serializable. I use Hibernate as a JPA implementation. I wonder: Is it vendor-specific requirement/behavior? What happens with my serializable entities? Should they be serializable for storing or for transferring? At which moment it becomes necessary to make my entity serializable?
Building a runnable jar with Maven 2 I'm relatively new to the Maven mantra, but I'm trying to build a command-line runnable jar with Maven. I've setup my dependencies, but when I run mvn install and attempt to run the jar, two things happen. First, no main class is found, which is correctable. When I've corrected this, I get errors on run stating that classes cannot be found. Maven is not packaging my dependency libraries inside of the jar, so I am unable to run the jar as a stand-alone application. How do I correct this?
Google Guice vs. PicoContainer for Dependency Injection My team is researching dependency injection frameworks and is trying to decide between using Google-Guice and PicoContainer. We are looking for several things in our framework: A small code footprint - What I mean by a small code footprint is we don't want to have dependency injection code litter everywhere in our code base. If we need to refactor down the road, we want it to be as easy as possible. Performance - How much overhead does each framework have when creating and injecting objects? Ease of use - Is there a large learning curve? Do we have to write mounds of code to get something simple working? We want to have as little configuration as possible. Community size - Larger communities usually means that a project will continue to be maintained. We don't want to use a framework and have to fix our own bugs ;) Also any questions we have along the way can (hopefully) be answered by the framework's developer/user community . Comparisons of the two frameworks against the listed criteria would be greatly appreciated. Any personal experiences that help to compare the two would also be extremely helpful. Disclaimer: I'm fairly new to dependency injection so excuse my noob-ness if I asked a question that isn't pertinent to this discussion.

How to configure Eclipse build path to use Maven dependencies? I would like to take advantage of the features that Maven provides for managing dependencies in a project. My brief understanding of how Maven works is that it will aquire the JARs needed and then build the project with these libraries. Currently I have a simple POM file set up as a test: Usually when managing dependencies for a project I would add the project or JAR to the project build path and then be able to build my project.. But when using M2Eclipse the dependencies do are not automatically added to the build path. Is there somewhere I need to configure this to allow Eclipse to know that Maven is managing the dependencies?

(The two methods are in seperate packages and seperate classes).
Is it unnecessary to put super() in constructor? Isn't this one automatically put by the compiler if I don't put it in a subclass's constructor? That means I don't even need to care about it? In some articles they put it out. And if I've got one constructor with arguments, will this be the constructor, or does it take a constructor without argument list?

How to supply value to an annotation from a Constant java I am thinking this may not be possible in Java because annotation and its parameters are resolved at compile time. I have an interface as follows, and another class as, I mark many classes with the annotation and I would like to know if I can avoid specifying the strings in every annotation I would instead prefer to use However this gives compilation errors like annotation value should be an array initializer etc. Does someone know how I can use a String constant or String[] constant to supply value to an annotation?

Fast Bitmap Blur For Android SDK Currently in an Android application that I'm developing I'm looping through the pixels of an image to blur it. This takes about 30 seconds on a 640x480 image. While browsing apps in the Android Market I came across one that includes a blur feature and their blur is very fast (like 5 seconds) so they must be using a different method of blurring. Anyone know a faster way other than looping through the pixels?
Why is String class declared final in Java? From when I learned that the class java.lang.String is declared as final in Java, I was wondering why is that? I didn't find any answer back then, but this post: How to create a replica of String class in Java? reminded me of my query. Sure, String provides all the functionality I ever needed, and never thought of any operation that would require an extension of class String, but still you'll never know what someone might need! So, does anyone know what was the intent of the designers when they decided to make it final?
Why doesn't Java allow to throw a checked exception from static initialization block? Why doesn't Java allow to throw a checked exception from a static initialization block? What was the reason behind this design decision?
What is the point of the class Option[T]? I am not able to understand the point of Option[T] class in Scala. I mean, I am not able to see any advanages of None over null. For example, consider the code: returns a Person instance or null returns either Some[Person] or None Do nothing Now suppose, the method getPerson1 returns null, then the call made to display on first line of main is bound to fail with NPE. Similarly if getPerson2 returns None, the display call will again fail with some similar error. If so, then why does Scala complicate things by introducing a new value wrapper (Option[T]) instead of following a simple approach used in Java? UPDATE: I have edited my code as per @Mitch's suggestion. I am still not able to see any particular advantage of Option[T]. I have to test for the exceptional null or None in both cases. :( If I have understood correctly from @Michael's reply, is the only advantage of Option[T] is that it explicitly tells the programmer that this method could return None? Is this the only reason behind this design choice?
Importing two classes with same name. How to handle? Say I've a code like: I want to choose my.own.Date here. How? I want to choose util.Date here. How ? Should I be full qualified class names? Can I get rid of the import statements? Is such a scenario common in real world programming?
What is .jspf file extension? How to compile it? What are .jspf files in JSP? As I know the compiler will look for .jsp files to compile, then how are the .jspf files compiled?
Choosing a Java Web Framework now? we are in the planning stage of migrating a large website which is built on a custom developed mvc framework to a java based web framework which provides built-in support for ajax, rich media content, mashup, templates based layout, validation, maximum html/java code separation. Grails looked like a good choice, however, we do not want to use a scripting language. We want to continue using java. Template based layout is a primary concern as we intend to use this web application with multiple web sites with similar functionality but radically different look and feel. Is portal based solution a good fit to this problem? Any insights on using "Spring Roo" or "Play" will be very helpful. I did find similar posts like this, but it is more than a year old. Things have surely changed in the mean time! EDIT 1: Thanks for the great answers! This site is turning to be the best single source for in-the-trenches programmer info. However, I was expecting more info on using a portal-cms duo. Jahia looks goods. Anything similar?
What is the relative performance difference of if/else versus switch statement in Java? Worrying about my web application's performances, I am wondering which of "if/else" or switch statement is better regarding performance?
Byte[] to InputStream or OutputStream I have a blob column in my database table, for which I have to use byte[] in my Java program as a mapping and to use this data I have to convert it to InputStream or OutputStream. But I don't know what happens internally when I do so. Can anyone briefly explain me what's happening when I do this conversion?

What is the difference between JSF, Servlet and JSP? How are JSP and Servlet related to each other? Is JSP some kind of Servlet? How are JSP and JSF related to each other? Is JSF some kind of prebuild UI based JSP like ASP.NET-MVC?
Including jars in classpath on commandline (javac or apt) trying to run this program. I think that to setup all of the web service stuff I need to run apt. (Although using javac I am having the same issue). I think what I am getting is compile errors. (Shown at bottom). I think what I need to do is include this jar in my class path: jsr181-api.jar (source). Is there a simple temporary way to do this (on solaris)? I don't want to add it to my bash_rc file (it is there forever). I also know that there is some way to do it using a manifest text file but that seemed complicated so I didn't look into it yet. Can I just do something like: or Code: javax.jws.WebService @param name @return Say hello to the person. Compile errors: Update: Cool that is wrapped up but it is still not quite working. I have created a new question to keep things nice and organized:
Are there inline functions in java? Is there a concept of inline functions in java, or its replaced something else? If there is, how is it used? I've heard that public, static and final methods are the inline functions. Can we create our own inline function?
Is a Java array of primitives stored in stack or heap? I have an array declaration like this: Here a is an array of primitive int type. Where is this array stored? Is it stored on heap or stack? This is a primitve type int, all primitive types are not stored on heap.
Iterating through a list in reverse order in java I'm migrating a piece of code to make use of generics. One argument for doing so is that the for loop is much cleaner than keeping track of indexes, or using an explicit iterator. In about half the cases, the list (an ArrayList) is being iterated in reverse order by using an index today. Can someone suggest a cleaner way of doing this (since I dislike the indexed for loop when working with collections), though it does work? Note: I can't add any new dependencies outside the JDK.
Listing files in a directory matching a pattern in Java I'm looking for a way to get a list of files that match a pattern (pref regex) in a given directory. I've found a tutorial online that uses apache's commons-io package with the following code: But that just returns a base collection (According to the docs it's a collection of java.io.File). Is there a way to do this that returns a type safe generic collection?
Which is more efficient, a for-each loop, or an iterator? Which is the most efficient way to traverse a collection? or Please note, that this is not an exact duplicate of this, this, this, or this, although one of the answers to the last question comes close. The reason that this is not a dupe, is that most of these are comparing loops where you call get(i) inside the loop, rather than using the iterator. As suggested on Meta I will be posting my answer to this question.
Quickest way to find missing number in an array of numbers I have an array of numbers from 1 to 100 (both inclusive). The size of the array is 100. The numbers are randomly added to the array, but there is one random empty slot in the array. What is the quickest way to find that slot as well as the number that should be put in the slot? A Java solution is preferable.
Questions every good Java/Java EE Developer should be able to answer? I was going through Questions every good .Net developer should be able to answer and was highly impressed with the content and approach of this question, and so in the same spirit, I am asking this question for Java/Java EE Developer. What questions do you think should a good Java/Java EE programmer be able to answer? I am marking this question as community wiki as it is not user specific and it aims to serve programming community at large. Looking forward for some amazing responses. EDIT: Please answer questions too, as suggested in the comments, so that people could learn something new regarding the language, too.
Why java.lang.Object is not abstract? Possible Duplicate: Java: Rationale of the Object class not being declared abstract Why is the Object class, which is base class of 'em all in Java, not abstract? I've had this question for a really really long time and it is asked here purely out of curiosity, that's all. Nothing in my code or anybody's code is breaking because it is not abstract, but I was wondering why they made it concrete? Why would anyone want an "instance" (and not its presence a.k.a. Reference) of this Object class? One case is a poor synchronization code which uses the instance of an Object for locking (at least I used it this way once.. my bad). Is there any practical use of an "instance" of an Object class? And how does its instantiation fit in OOP? What would have happened if they had marked it abstract (of course after providing implementations to its methods)?
How to synchronize a static variable among threads running different instances of a class in java? I know that using the synchronize keyword before a method brings synchronization to that object. That is, 2 threads running the same instance of the object will be synchronized. However, since the synchronization is at the object level, 2 threads running different instances of the object will not be synchronized. So, if we have a static variable in a java class that is called by the method, we would like it to be synchronized across instances of the class. The two instances are running in 2 different threads. Can we achieve synchronization in the following way? Is it true that since we have defined an object 'lock' that is static and we are using the keyword synchronized for that lock, the static varibale count is now synchronized across instances of class Test?
Official reasons for "Software caused connection abort: socket write error" Given this stack trace snippet Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: socket write error at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0(Native Method) I tried to answer the following questions: What code is throwing this exception? (JVM?/Tomcat?/My code?) What causes this exception to be thrown? Regarding #1: Sun's JVM source doesn't contain this exact message, but I think the text Software caused connection abort: socket write error is from the native implementation of SocketOutputStream: Regarding #2 My guess is that it is caused when the client has terminated the connection, before getting the full response (e.g. sent a request, but before getting the full response, it got closed / terminated / offline) Questions: Are the above assumptions correct (#1 and #2)? Can this be diffrentiated from the situation: "could not write to the client, due to a network error on the server side"? or would that render the same error message? And most important: Is there an official document (e.g from Sun) stating the above? I need to have a proof that this stack trace is the socket client's "fault", and there is nothing that the server could have done to avoid it. (except catching the exception, or using a non Sun JVM SocketOutputStream, though both don't really avoid the fact the client has terminated)
Who is calling the Java Thread interrupt() method if I'm not? I've read and re-read Java Concurrency in Practice, I've read several threads here on the subject, I've read the IBM article Dealing with InterruptedException and yet there's something I'm simply not grasping which I think can be broken down into two questions: If I'm never ever interrupting other threads myself, what can trigger an InterruptedException? If I'm never ever interrupting other threads myself using interrupt() (say because I'm using other means to cancel my working threads, like poison pills and while (!cancelled) style loop [as both explained in JCIP]), what does an InterruptedException then mean? What am I supposed to do upon catching one? Shutdown my app?
Java stack overflow error - how to increase the stack size in Eclipse? I am running a program that I've written in Java in Eclipse. The program has a very deep level of recursion for very large inputs. For smaller inputs the program runs fine however when large inputs are given, I get the following error: Can this be solved by increasing the Java stack size and if so, how do I do this in Eclipse? Update: @Jon Skeet The code is traversing a parse tree recursively in order to build up a datastructure. So, for example the code will do some work using a node in the parse tree and call itself on the node's two children, combining their results to give the overall result for the tree. The total depth of the recursion depends on the size of the parse tree but the code seems to fail (without a larger stack) when the number of recursive calls gets into the 1000s. Also I'm pretty sure the code isn't failing because of a bug as it works for small inputs.
java: how can i do dynamic casting of a variable from one type to another? i would like to do dynamic casting for a java variable, the casting type is stored in a different variable. this is regular casting: this is what i want: is it possible? and if so how? thanks! update I'm trying to populate a class with a hashMap that i received. this is the constructor: <= CASTING PROBLEM the problem here is that some of the classes variables are Double type, and if the number 3 is received it sees it as Integer and i have type problem.
Java heap terminology: young, old and permanent generations? I'm trying to understand how the concepts of young, old and permanent generations in the Java heap terminology, and more specifically the interactions between the three generations.

java: ArrayList - how can i check if an index exists? I'm using ArrayList<String> and I add data at specific indices, how can I check if a specific index exists? Should I simply get() and check the value? Or should I wait for an exception? Is there another way? Update Thank you for your answers, but because I'm only adding stuff at specific indices, the length of the list will not show me which are available.
Main differences between SOAP and RESTful web services in java Follow up question to this post: For now I have a slight idea about the differences between SOAP and RESTful Services. My question is when I should use SOAP, and when I should use RESTful; which one is "better" when it comes to performance/speed or request handling? I'm implementing for the first time in RESTful(java) and I want know more about it; I've dealt with SOAP before.
@BeforeClass and inheritance - order of execution I have an abstract base class, which I use as a base for my unit tests (TestNG 5.10). In this class, I initialize the whole environment for my tests, setting up database mappings, etc. This abstract class has a method with a @BeforeClass annotation which does the initialization. Next, I extend that class with specific classes in which I have @Test methods and also @BeforeClass methods. These methods do class-specific initialization of the environment (e.g. put some records into the database). How I can enforce a specific order of the @BeforeClass annotated methods? I need the ones from the abstract base class to be executed before the ones of the extending class. Example: Expected order: Actual order: <- crashes, as the base init is missing <---not executed <-/

How to cast a double to an int in Java by rounding it down? I need to cast a double to an int in Java, but the numerical value must always round down. i.e. 99.99999999 -> 99
Why does appending "" to a String save memory? I used a variable with a lot of data in it, say String data. I wanted to use a small part of this string in the following way: After some hours of debugging (with a memory visualizer) I found out that the objects field smallpart remembered all the data from data, although it only contained the substring. When I changed the code into: ..the problem was solved! Now my application uses very little memory now! How is that possible? Can anyone explain this? I think this.smallpart kept referencing towards data, but why? UPDATE: How can I clear the big String then? Will data = new String(data.substring(0,100)) do the thing?
How do I set the timeout for a JAX-WS webservice client? I've used JAXWS-RI 2.1 to create an interface for my web service, based on a WSDL. I can interact with the web service no problems, but haven't been able to specify a timeout for sending requests to the web service. If for some reason it does not respond the client just seems to spin it's wheels forever. Hunting around has revealed that I should probably be trying to do something like this: I also discovered that, depending on which version of JAXWS-RI you have, you may need to set these properties instead: The problem I have is that, regardless of which of the above is correct, I don't know where I can do this. All I've got is a Service subclass that implements the auto-generated interface to the webservice and at the point that this is getting instanciated, if the WSDL is non-responsive then it's already too late to set the properties: Can anyone point me in the right direction?!

How to set focus on a view when a layout is created and displayed? Currently, I have a layout which contains a Button, a TextView and an EditText. When the layout is displayed, the focus will be automatically put on the EditText, which will trigger the keyboard to show up on Android phone. It is not what I want. Is there any way that I can set the focus on TextView or on nothing when a layout is displayed?

Java: recommended solution for deep cloning/copying an instance I'm wondering if there is a recommended way of doing deep clone/copy of instance in java. I have 3 solutions in mind, but I can have miss some, and I'd like to have your opinion edit: include Bohzo propositon and refine question: it's more about deep cloning than shallow cloning. Do it yourself: code the clone by hand properties after properties and check that mutable instances are cloned too. pro: - control of what will be performed - quick execution cons: - tedious to write and maintain - bug prone (copy/paste failure, missing property, reassigned mutable property) Use reflection: With your own reflection tools or with an external helper (like jakarta common-beans) it is easy to write a generic copy method that will do the job in one line. pro: - easy to write - no maintenance cons: - less control of what happens - bug prone with mutable object if the reflection tool does not clone sub objects too - slower execution Use clone framework: Use a framework that do it for you, like : commons-lang SerializationUtils Java Deep Cloning Library Dozer Kryo pro: - same as reflection - more control over what will be exactly be cloned. cons: - every mutable instance is fully cloned, even at the end of the hierarchy - could be very slow to execute Use bytecode instrumentation to write clone at runtime javassit, BCEL or cglib might be use to generate a dedicated cloner as fast as one hand writed. Someone knows a lib using one of these tools for this purpose ? What I have missed here ? Which one would you recommend ? Thanks.
Paste a multi-line Java String in Eclipse Unfortunately, Java has no syntax for multi-line string literals.

Eclipse will not open due to environment variables I just rebooted my computer without changing anything. Suddenly I can't open eclipse. Instead, I get this error message: TinyPic image of JRE error dialog http://i46.tinypic.com/34rd4as.gif And I see all my environment variables have been erased. Java, javac, mvn obviously don't work.

Is Java really slow? Java has some degree of reputation for being slow. Is Java really slow? If yes, why? Where is (or was) the bottleneck? Is it because of inefficient JVMs? Garbage collection? Pure bytecode libraries instead of JNI-wrapped C code? Many other languages have these features, but they don't have this reputation for slowness.
How do I prevent Spring 3.0 MVC @ModelAttribute variables from appearing in URL? Using Spring MVC 3.0.0.RELEASE, I have the following Controller: setIntakeDate addAttribute add assignIntakeACaseNumber ... Set up command object Validate Intake command object and persist to database ... The Controller reads Intake information from a command object populated from an HTML form, validates the command object, persists the information to the database, and returns a case number. Everything works great, except for when I redirect to the intakeDetails.htm page, I get a URL that looks like this: http://localhost:8080/project/intakeDetails.htm?caseNumber=1&users=user1&users=user2&users=user3&users=user4... How do I prevent the user Collection from showing up in the URL?
Pros and cons of Java rules engines What are the pros and cons to adopting the Java rules engines JESS and Drools? Are there any other players? I understand that Drools is Open Source and JESS is not, but how do they compare in other areas like ease of use, performance, level of integration with your code?
Does Java casting introduce overhead? Why? Is there any overhead when we cast objects of one type to another? Or the compiler just resolves everything and there is no cost at run time? Is this a general things, or there are different cases? For example, suppose we have an array of Object[], where each element might have a different type. But we always know for sure that, say, element 0 is a Double, element 1 is a String. (I know this is a wrong design, but let's just assume I had to do this.) Is Java's type information still kept around at run time? Or everything is forgotten after compilation, and if we do (Double)elements[0], we'll just follow the pointer and interpret those 8 bytes as a double, whatever that is? I'm very unclear about how types are done in Java. If you have any reccommendation on books or article then thanks, too.
How to run all tests belonging to a certain Category in JUnit 4 JUnit 4.8 contains a nice new feature called "Categories" that allows you to group certain kinds of tests together. This is very useful, e.g. to have separate test runs for slow and fast tests. I know the stuff mentioned in JUnit 4.8 release notes, but would like to know how I can actually run all the tests annotated with certain category. The JUnit 4.8 release notes show an example suite definition, where SuiteClasses annotation selects the tests from certain category to run, like this: Note that Categories is a kind of Suite Will run A.b and B.c, but not A.a Does anyone know how I could run all the tests in SlowTests category? It seems that you must have the SuiteClasses annotation...
Calling clojure from java Most of the top google hits for "calling clojure from java" are outdated and recommend using clojure.lang.RT to compile the source code.

Java Pass Method as Parameter I am looking for a way to pass a method by reference. I understand that Java does not pass methods as parameters, however, I would like to get an alternative. I've been told interfaces are the alternative to passing methods as parameters but I don't understand how an interface can act as a method by reference. If I understand correctly an interface is simply an abstract set of methods that are not defined. I don't want to send an interface that needs to be defined every time because several different methods could call the same method with the same parameters. What I would like to accomplish is something similar to this: recursive call if Container end if node end looping through components invoked such as:

How to import a class from default package Possible Duplicate: How to access java-classes in the default-package? I am using Eclipse 3.5 and I have created a project with some package structure along with the default package. I have one class in default package - Calculations.java and I want to make the use of that class in any of the package (for instance in com.company.calc). When I try to make the use of the class which is in the default package, it's giving me a compiler error. It's not able to recognise the class in default package. Where is the problem? Calculations.java - source code loadLibrary I can't put my class in any other package. This class has some native methods which are implemented in Delphi. If I put that class in any of the folders, I will have to make changes to that DLL which I want to avoid (really - I can not). That's why I put my class in the default package.

Converting ISO 8601-compliant String to java.util.Date I am trying to convert an ISO 8601 formatted String to a java.util.Date. I found the pattern "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ" to be ISO8601-compliant if used with a Locale (compare sample). However, using the java.text.SimpleDateFormat, I cannot convert the correctly formatted String "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00". I have to convert it first to "2010-01-01T12:00:00+0100", without the colon. So, the current solution is which obviously isn't that nice. Am I missing something or is there a better solution? answer Thanks to JuanZe's comment, I found the Joda-Time magic, it is also described here. So, the solution is Or more simply, use the default parser via the constructor: To me, this is nice.
How to split a string, but also keep the delimiters? I have a multiline string which is delimited by a set of different delimiters: I can split this string into its parts, using String.split, but it seems that I can't get the actual string, which matched the delimiter regex. In other words, this is what I get: Text1 Text2 Text3 Text4 This is what I want Text1 DelimiterA Text2 DelimiterC Text3 DelimiterB Text4 Is there any JDK way to split the string using a delimiter regex but also keep the delimiters?
Why is no one using make for Java? Just about every Java project that I've seen either uses Maven or Ant. They are fine tools and I think just about any project can use them. But what ever happened to make? It's used for a variety of non-Java projects and can easily handle Java. Sure you have to download make.exe if you use Windows, but Ant and Maven also don't come with the JDK. Is there some fundamental flaw with make when used with Java? Is it just because Ant and Maven are written in Java?
Why not abstract fields? Why can't Java classes have abstract fields like they can have abstract methods? For example: I have two classes that extend the same abstract base class. These two classes each have a method that is identical except for a String constant, which happens to be an error message, within them. If fields could be abstract, I could make this constant abstract and pull the method up into the base class. Instead, I have to create an abstract method, called getErrMsg() in this case, that returns the String, override this method in the two derived classes, and then I can pull up the method (which now calls the abstract method). Why couldn't I just make the field abstract to begin with? Could Java have been designed to allow this?
What is Daemon thread in Java? Can anybody tell me what daemon threads are in Java?
Converting Hibernate proxy to real object During Hibernate session I am loading some objects and some of them are loaded as proxies due to lazy loading. It's all OK and I don't want to turn lazy loading off. But later I need to send some of the objects (actually one object) to the GWT client via RPC. And it happens that this concrete object is a proxy. So I need to turn it to real object. I can't find a method like "materialize" in Hibernate. How can I turn some of the objects from proxies to reals knowing their class and ID? At the moment the only solution I see is to evict that object from Hibernate's cache and reload it, but it is really bad for many reasons.

Closing Database Connections in Java I am getting a little confused, I was reading the below from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity It's important to close the statement when you are done with it Do you not need to close the conn Connection? What is really happening if the conn.close() doesn't occur? I have a private web app I'm maintaining that doesn't currently close either form, but is the important one really the stmt one, the conn one, or both? The site keeps going down intermittently but the server keeps saying it's a database connection issue, my suspicion is that it's not being closed, but I don't know which if any to close.

Maven: add a dependency to a jar by relative path I have a proprietary jar that I want to add to my pom as a dependency. But I don't want to add it to a repository. The reason is that I want my usual maven commands such as mvn compile, etc, to work out of the box. (Without demanding from the developers a to add it to some repository by themselves). I want the jar to be in a 3rdparty lib in source control, and link to it by relative path from the pom.xml file. Can this be done? How?
How to check for a valid URL in Java? What is the best way to check if a URL is valid in Java? If tried to call new URL(urlString) and catch a MalformedURLException, but it seems to be happy with anything that begins with http://.

Edit: Some examples of accepted URLs are http://*** and http://my favorite site!.
When is a Java method name too long? In the last weeks I've seen some guys using really long names for a Method or Class (50 characters), this is usually under the premise that it improves readability, my opinion is that a long name like this is an indicator that we are trying to do a lot or too much in a method class if we need such a long name, however I wanted to know what do you guys think about it. An Example is:
How to change highlighted occurrences color in Eclipse's sidebar? When you have "Mark occurrences" enabled in Eclipse, placing the cursor on any type/variable/method/etc will highlight all occurrences in the text editor and place a faint bar in the right ruler to show you the location of other occurrences in the file. Does anyone know where in the Preferences you can change what color is used to highlight the other occurrences in the side ruler? The color is way too faint for me with my current monitor/Windows Aero theme. I tried to go into Preferences > General > Appearance > Color and Fonts change the color for "Color labels - match highlight" but this didn't seem to apply. Here is a screenshot with what I am talking about:
Scanner vs. BufferedReader As far I know, the two most common methods of reading character-based data from a file in Java is using Scanner or BufferedReader. I also know that the BufferedReader read files efficiently by using a buffer to avoid physical disk operations. My questions are: Does Scanner performs as well as BufferedReader? Why would you choose Scanner over BufferedReader or vice versa?
What is the purpose of Serialization in Java? I have read quite a number of articles on Serialization and how it is so nice and great but none of the arguments were convincing enough. I am wondering if someone can really tell me what is it that we can really achieve by serializing a class?

Which maven dependencies to include for spring 3.0? I am trying to do my first project with Spring 3.0 (and maven). I have been using Spring 2.5 (and primer versions) in quite some projects. Nevertheless I am kinda confused, what modules I have to define as dependencies in my pom.xml. I just want to use the core container functions (beans, core, context, el). I was used to do this: But now I am kinda confused, as there is no full packed spring module for version 3.0 anymore. I tried the following but it didnt work (some classes are missing). Any help would be appreciated!
Can I obtain method parameter name using Java reflection? If I have a class like this: is there any way to know that aMethod uses a parameter named aParam, that is of type int?
Java thread affinity Does anybody know of a way to lock down individual threads within a Java process to specific CPU cores (on Linux)? I've done this in C, but can't find how to do this in Java. My instincts are that this will require a JNI call, but I was hoping someone here might have some insight or might have done it before. Thanks!

NoClassDefFoundError - Eclipse and Android I'm having a problem trying to run an Android app which, up until adding a second external library to its build path, was working fine. Since having added the scoreninja jar, I now get a NoClassDefFoundError when I try to run the app. Here's the message: As all of the build scripts are generated by the Android tools (?), I'm not sure what else I can do other than cleaning and rebuilding or restarting eclipse (I have already tried all three). Does anyone know how I can amend this?
Handling exceptions from Java ExecutorService tasks I'm trying to use Java's ThreadPoolExecutor class to run a large number of heavy weight tasks with a fixed number of threads. Each of the tasks has many places during which it may fail due to exceptions. I've subclassed ThreadPoolExecutor and I've overridden the afterExecute method which is supposed to provide any uncaught exceptions encountered while running a task. However, I can't seem to make it work. For example: println submit shutdown core threads max threads timeout timeout units work queue The output from this program is "Everything's fine--situation normal!" even though the only Runnable submitted to the thread pool throws an exception. Any clue to what's going on here? Thanks!
Spring MVC vs JSF I haved used Struts framework in all my past applications and for the new application,my client has requested to use either Spring MVC or JSF? I am not familiar with these two frameworks but our timelines are strict. So, I am not sure which framework I will choose to build the application. Can anyone please suggest me which framework will be easy to learn in quick time? Thanks
Null check in an enhanced for loop What is the best way to guard against null in a for loop in Java? This seems ugly : do whatever Or Or throw ex do whatever There might not be any other way. Should they have put it in the for construct itself, if it is null then don't run the loop?
Compare two JSON objects in Java I'm looking for a JSON parsing library that supports comparing two JSON objects ignoring child order, specifically for unit testing JSON returning from a web service. Do any of the major JSON libraries support this? The org.json library simply does a reference comparison.
Java G1 garbage collection in production Since Java 7 is going to use the new G1 garbage collection by default is Java going to be able to handle an order of magnitude larger heap without supposed "devastating" GC pause times? Has anybody actually implemented G1 in production, what were your experiences? To be fair the only time I have seen really long GC pauses is on very large heaps, much more than a workstation would have. To clarify my question; will G1 open the gateway to heaps in the hundreds of GB? TB?
Can an int be null in Java? Can an int be null in Java? For example: do something do something My goal is to write a function which returns an int. Said int is stored in the height of a node, and if the node is not present, it will be null, and I'll need to check that. I am doing this for homework but this specific part is not part of the homework, it just helps me get through what I am doing. Thanks for the comments, but it seems very few people have actually read what's under the code, I was asking how else I can accomplish this goal; it was easy to figure out that it doesn't work.
Can I multiply strings in Java to repeat sequences? I have something like the following: I'd like to append i "0"s to the someNum string. Does it have some way I can multiply a string to repeat it like Python does? So I could just go: or something similar? Where, in this case, my final result would be: "123000".
java: run a function after a specific number of seconds I have a specific function that I want to be executed after 5 seconds. How can i do that in Java?

Why do I need to override the equals and hashCode methods in Java? Recently I read through this Developer Works Document. The document is all about defining hashCode() and equals() effectively and correctly, but I am not able to figure out why we need to override these two methods. How can I take the decision to implement these method efficiently?
When to use Comparable and Comparator I have a list of objects I need to sort on a field, say Score. Without giving much thought I wrote a new class that implements Comparator, that does the task and it works. Now looking back at this, I am wondering if I should have instead have the my class implement Comparable instead of creating a new class that implements Comparator. The score is the only field that the objects will be ordered on. What I have done acceptable as a practice? Is the right approach "First have the class implement Comparable (for the natural ordering) and if an alternative field comparison is required, then create a new class that implements Comparator" ? If (2) above is true, then does it mean that one should implement Comparator only after they have the class implement Comparable? (Assuming I own the original class).

How to timeout a thread I want to run a thread for some fixed amount of time. If it is not completed within that time, I want to either kill it, throw some exception, or handle it in some way. How can it be done? One way of doing it as I figured out from this thread is to use a TimerTask inside the run() method of the Thread. Are there any better solutions for this? EDIT: Adding a bounty as I needed a clearer answer. The ExecutorService code given below does not address my problem. Why should I sleep() after executing (some code - I have no handle over this piece of code)? If the code is completed and the sleep() is interrupted, how can that be a timeOut? The task that needs to be executed is not in my control. It can be any piece of code. The problem is this piece of code might run into an infinite loop. I don't want that to happen. So, I just want to run that task in a separate thread. The parent thread has to wait till that thread finishes and needs to know the status of the task (i.e whether it timed out or some exception occured or if its a success). If the task goes into an infinite loop, my parent thread keeps on waiting indefinitely, which is not an ideal situation.
How to make mock to void methods with mockito How to mock methods with void return type? I implemented an Observer pattern but I can't mock it with Mockito because I don't know how. And I tried to find an example on the Internet, but didn't succeed. My class looks like setter getter state The system are not triggered with mock. =( I want to show above mentioned system state. And make assertion according to them.
Type List vs type ArrayList in Java I understand that with (1), implementations of the List interface can be swapped. It seems that (1) is typically used in an application regardless of need (myself I always use this). I am wondering if anyone uses (2)? Also, how often (and can I please get an example) does the situation actually require using (1) over (2) (i.e. where (2) wouldn't suffice..aside coding to interfaces and best practices etc.)
Named placeholders in string formatting In Python, when formatting string, I can fill placeholders by name rather than by position, like that: I wonder if that is possible in Java (hopefully, without external libraries)? Thanks in advance.
What does it mean: The serializable class does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field? I have the warning message given in the title. I would like to understand and remove it. I found already some answers on this question but I do not understand these answers because of an overload with technical terms. Is it possible to explain this issue with simple words? P.S.

How to generate a random BigInteger value in Java? I need to generate arbitrarily large random integers in the range 0 (inclusive) to n (exclusive). My initial thought was to call nextDouble and multiply by n, but once n gets to be larger than 253, the results would no longer be uniformly distributed. BigInteger has the following constructor available: Constructs a randomly generated BigInteger, uniformly distributed over the range 0 to (2numBits - 1), inclusive. How can this be used to get a random value in the range 0 - n, where n is not a power of 2?

Java Desktop application: SWT vs. Swing I'm a web developer at day and thinking about building my first real desktop application. The idea is to build a tool that automates a very repetitive task in a web application where no API is available. I know I want to use Java. I used it before for web stuff, know the syntax pretty well and want the application to be cross plattform as easy as possible. Where I'm not so sure is if I should use SWT or Swing. As my main audience uses Windows, I want to look it as native as possible there. Linux and Mac should work, but the looks are not so important here. So what are the arguments for and against each UI Framework, Swing or SWT? Thanks. PS: I develop on Windows using Eclipse. But was thinking about playing with Netbeans.
getResourceAsStream() vs FileInputStream I was trying to load a file in a webapp, and I was getting a FileNotFound exception when I used FileInputStream. However, using the same path, I was able to load the file when I did getResourceAsStream(). What is the difference between the two methods, and why does one work while the other doesn't?

Why doesn't String's hashCode() cache 0? I noticed in the Java 6 source code for String that hashCode only caches values other than 0. The difference in performance is exhibited by the following snippet: currentTimeMillis toUpperCase hashCode test format Running this in ideone.com gives the following output: So my questions are: Why doesn't String's hashCode() cache 0? What is the probability that a Java string hashes to 0? What's the best way to avoid the performance penalty of recomputing the hash value every time for strings that hash to 0? Is this the best-practice way of caching values? (i.e. cache all except one?) For your amusement, each line here is a string that hash to 0:

Why doesn't Java have compound assignment versions of the conditional-and and conditional-or operators? (&&=, ||=) So for binary operators on booleans, Java has &, |, ^, && and ||. Let's summarize what they do briefly here: JLS 15.22.2 Boolean Logical Operators &, ^, and | JLS 15.23 Conditional-And Operator && JLS 15.24 Conditional-Or Operator || For &, the result value is true if both operand values are true; otherwise, the result is false. For |, the result value is false if both operand values are false; otherwise, the result is true. For ^, the result value is true if the operand values are different; otherwise, the result is false. The && operator is like & but evaluates its right-hand operand only if the value of its left-hand operand is true. The || operator is like |, but evaluates its right-hand operand only if the value of its left-hand operand is false. Now, among all 5, 3 of those have compound assignment versions, namely |=, &= and ^=. So my question is obvious: why doesn't Java provide &&= and ||= as well? I find that I need those more than I need &= and |=. And I don't think that "because it's too long" is a good answer, because Java has >>>=. There must be a better reason for this omission. From 15.26 Assignment Operators: There are 12 assignment operators; [...] = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= >>>= &= ^= |= A comment was made that if &&= and ||= were implemented, then it would be the only operators that do not evaluate the right hand side first. I believe this notion that a compound assignment operator evaluates the right hand side first is a mistake. From 15.26.2 Compound Assignment Operators: A compound assignment expression of the form E1 op= E2 is equivalent to E1 = (T)((E1) op (E2)), where T is the type of E1, except that E1 is evaluated only once. As proof, the following snippet throws a NullPointerException, not an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Java: Multiple class declarations in one file In Java, you can define multiple top level classes in a single file, providing that at most one of these is public (see JLS §7.6). See below for example. Is there a tidy name for this technique (analogous to inner, nested, anonymous)? The JLS says the system may enforce the restriction that these secondary classes can't be referred to by code in other compilation units of the package, e.g., they can't be treated as package-private. Is that really something that changes between Java implementations? e.g., PublicClass.java:
Managing highly repetitive code and documentation in Java Highly repetitive code is generally a bad thing, and there are design patterns that can help minimize this. However, sometimes it's simply inevitable due to the constraints of the language itself. Take the following example from java.util.Arrays: Assigns the specified long value to each element of the specified range of the specified array of longs. The range to be filled extends from index <tt>fromIndex</tt>, inclusive, to index <tt>toIndex</tt>, exclusive. (If <tt>fromIndex==toIndex</tt>, the range to be filled is empty.) @param a the array to be filled @param fromIndex the index of the first element (inclusive) to be filled with the specified value @param toIndex the index of the last element (exclusive) to be filled with the specified value @param val the value to be stored in all elements of the array @throws IllegalArgumentException if <tt>fromIndex &gt; toIndex</tt> @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if <tt>fromIndex &lt; 0</tt> or <tt>toIndex &gt; a.length</tt> The above snippet appears in the source code 8 times, with very little variation in the documentation/method signature but exactly the same method body, one for each of the root array types int[], short[], char[], byte[], boolean[], double[], float[], and Object[]. I believe that unless one resorts to reflection (which is an entirely different subject in itself), this repetition is inevitable. I understand that as a utility class, such high concentration of repetitive Java code is highly atypical, but even with the best practice, repetition does happen! Refactoring doesn't always work because it's not always possible (the obvious case is when the repetition is in the documentation). Obviously maintaining this source code is a nightmare. A slight typo in the documentation, or a minor bug in the implementation, is multiplied by however many repetitions was made. In fact, the best example happens to involve this exact class: Google Research Blog - Extra, Extra - Read All About It: Nearly All Binary Searches and Mergesorts are Broken (by Joshua Bloch, Software Engineer) The bug is a surprisingly subtle one, occurring in what many thought to be just a simple and straightforward algorithm. int mid =(low + high) / 2; the bug the fix The above line appears 11 times in the source code! So my questions are: How are these kinds of repetitive Java code/documentation handled in practice? How are they developed, maintained, and tested? Do you start with "the original", and make it as mature as possible, and then copy and paste as necessary and hope you didn't make a mistake? And if you did make a mistake in the original, then just fix it everywhere, unless you're comfortable with deleting the copies and repeating the whole replication process? And you apply this same process for the testing code as well? Would Java benefit from some sort of limited-use source code preprocessing for this kind of thing? Perhaps Sun has their own preprocessor to help write, maintain, document and test these kind of repetitive library code? A comment requested another example, so I pulled this one from Google Collections: com.google.common.base.Predicates lines 276-310 (AndPredicate) vs lines 312-346 (OrPredicate). The source for these two classes are identical, except for: AndPredicate vs OrPredicate (each appears 5 times in its class) "And(" vs Or(" (in the respective toString() methods) #and vs #or (in the @see Javadoc comments) true vs false (in apply; ! can be rewritten out of the expression) -1 /* all bits on */ vs 0 /* all bits off */ in hashCode() &= vs |= in hashCode()
As a Java programmer learning Python, what should I look out for? Much of my programming background is in Java, and I'm still doing most of my programming in Java. However, I'm starting to learn Python for some side projects at work, and I'd like to learn it as independent of my Java background as possible - i.e. I don't want to just program Java in Python. What are some things I should look out for? A quick example - when looking through the Python tutorial, I came across the fact that defaulted mutable parameters of a function (such as a list) are persisted (remembered from call to call). This was counter-intuitive to me as a Java programmer and hard to get my head around. (See here and here if you don't understand the example.) Someone also provided me with this list, which I found helpful, but short. Anyone have any other examples of how a Java programmer might tend to misuse Python...? Or things a Java programmer would falsely assume or have trouble understanding? Edit: Ok, a brief overview of the reasons addressed by the article I linked to to prevent duplicates in the answers (as suggested by Bill the Lizard). (Please let me know if I make a mistake in phrasing, I've only just started with Python so I may not understand all the concepts fully. And a disclaimer - these are going to be very brief, so if you don't understand what it's getting at check out the link.) A static method in Java does not translate to a Python classmethod A switch statement in Java translates to a hash table in Python Don't use XML Getters and setters are evil (hey, I'm just quoting :) ) Code duplication is often a necessary evil in Java (e.g. method overloading), but not in Python (And if you find this question at all interesting, check out the link anyway. :) It's quite good.)

doGet and doPost in Servlets I've developed an HTML page that sends information to a Servlet. In the Servlet, I am using the methods doGet() and doPost(): In the html page code that calls the Servlet is: When I use method = "get" in the Servlet, I get the value of id and password, however when using method = "post", id and password are set to null. Why don't I get the values in this case? Another thing I'd like to know is how to use the data generated or validated by the Servlet. For example, if the Servlet shown above authenticates the user, I'd like to print the user id in my HTML page. I should be able to send the string 'id' as a response and use this info in my HTML page. Is it possible?
Stateless and Stateful Enterprise Java Beans I am going through the Java EE 6 tutorial and I am trying to understand the difference between stateless and stateful session beans. If stateless session beans do not retain their state in between method calls, why is my program acting the way it is? javax.ejb.LocalBean javax.ejb.Stateless The client println javax.servlet.http java.io.IOException java.io.PrintWriter javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet mybeans.MyBean getNumber getWriter javax.ejb.EJB increment javax.servlet I was expecting getNumber to return 0 every time but it is returning 1 and reloads of the servlet in my browser increase it more. The problem is with my understanding of how stateless session beans work and not with the libraries or application server, of course. Can somebody give me a simple hello world type example of a stateless session bean that behaves differently when you change it to stateful?

Java SimpleDateFormat for time zone with a colon separator? I have a date in the following format: 2010-03-01T00:00:00-08:00 I have thrown the following SimpleDateFormats at it to parse it: ISO8601 long RFC822 zone ISO8601 long long form zone ignore timezone ISO8601 short birthdate from NIST IHE C32 sample just the year I have a convenience method that uses those formats like so: It seems to hit on the pattern yyyyMMddHHmm but returns the date as Thu Dec 03 00:01:00 PST 2009. What is the correct pattern to parse this date? UPDATE: I don't NEED the time zone parsing. I don't anticipate having time sensitive issues moving between zones, but how would I get the "-08:00" zone format to parse????

Custom fonts and XML layouts (Android) I'm trying to define a GUI layout using XML files in Android. As far as I can find out, there is no way to specify that your widgets should use a custom font (e.g. one you've placed in assets/font/) in XML files and you can only use the system installed fonts. I know that, in the Java code, I could change the font of each widget manually using unique IDs. Alternatively, I could iterate over all the widgets in Java to make this change, but this would probably be very slow. What other options do I have? Is there any better ways to making widgets that have a custom look? I don't particularly want to have to manually change the font for every new widget I add.
Jackson Vs. Gson After searching through some existing libraries for JSON, I have finally ended up with these two: Jackson Google GSon I am a bit partial towards GSON, but word on the net is that GSon suffers from a certain celestial performance issue (as of Sept 2009). I am continuing my comparison; in the meantime, I'm looking for help to make up my mind.
How to mark logical sections of code in Java comments? Java classes are generally divided into logical "blocks". Is there a convention to mark these sections? Ideally, it would be supported by the major IDEs. I personally use this method: Section name here However, some editors seem to have problems with this. As an example, in Objective-C code you can use this method: This will result in a menu in XCode that looks like this:

How can I get the SQL of a PreparedStatement? I have a general Java method with the following method signature: It opens a connection, builds a PreparedStatement using the sql statement and the parameters in the queryParams variable length array, runs it, caches the ResultSet (in a CachedRowSetImpl), closes the connection, and returns the cached result set. I have exception handling in the method that logs errors. I log the sql statement as part of the log since it's very helpful for debugging. My problem is that logging the String variable sql logs the template statement with ?'s instead of actual values. I want to log the actual statement that was executed (or tried to execute). So... Is there any way to get the actual SQL statement that will be run by a PreparedStatement? (Without building it myself. If I can't find a way to access the PreparedStatement's SQL, I'll probably end up building it myself in my catches.)
Convert 4 bytes to int I'm reading a binary file like this: ??? What I want to do it to read up to 4 bytes and create a int value from those but, I don't know how to do it. I kind of feel like I have to grab 4 bytes at a time, and perform one "byte" operation ( like >> << >> & FF and stuff like that ) to create the new int What's the idiom for this? EDIT Ooops this turn out to be a bit more complex ( to explain ) What I'm trying to do is, read a file ( may be ascii, binary, it doesn't matter ) and extract the integers it may have. For instance suppose the binary content ( in base 2 ) : The integer representation should be 1 , 2 right? :- / 1 for the first 32 bits, and 2 for the remaining 32 bits. Would be -1 and Would be Integer.MAX_VALUE ( 2147483647 )

What does 'public static void' mean in Java? What does public static void mean in Java? I'm in the process of learning. In all the examples in the book I'm working from public static void comes before any method that is being used or created. What does this mean?
How to set selected item of Spinner by value, not by position? I have a update view, where I need to preselect the value stored in database for a Spinner. I was having in mind something like this, but the Adapter has no indexOf method, so I am stuck.
Java: how do I get a class literal from a generic type? Typically, I've seen people use the class literal like this: But what if the type is generic, e.g. List? This works fine, but has a warning since List should be parameterized: So why not add a <?>? Well, this causes a type mismatch error: I figured something like this would work, but this is just a plain ol' a syntax error: How can I get a Class<List<Foo>> statically, e.g. using the class literal? I could use @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") to get rid of the warnings caused by the non-parameterized use of List in the first example, Class<List> cls = List.class, but I'd rather not. Any suggestions?
What is a classpath? I was just reading this line: The first thing the format() method does is load a Velocity template from the classpath named output.vm And I couldn't figure out what was meant by classpath in this context.
Java - JDBC alternatives this is just theoretical question. I use JDBC with my Java applications for using database (select, insert, update, delete or whatever). I make "manually" Java classes which will contain data from DB tables (attribute = db column). Then I make queries (ResultSet) and fill those classes with data. I am not sure, if this is the right way. But I've read lot of about JDO and another persistence solutions. Can someone please recommend the best used JDBC alternatives, based on their experience? I would also like to know the advantages of JDO over JDBC (in simple words). I've been able to google lot of this stuff, but opinions from the "first hand" are always best. Thanks
Difference between Inheritance and Composition Are Composition and Inheritance the same? If I want to implement the composition pattern, how can I do that in Java?

leiningen - how to add dependencies for local jars? I want to use leiningen to build and develop my clojure project. Is there a way to modify project.clj to tell it to pick some jars from local directories? I have some proprietary jars that cannot be uploaded to public repos. Also, can leiningen be used to maintain a "lib" directory for clojure projects? If a bunch of my clojure projects share the same jars, I don't want to maintain a separate copy for each of them. Thanks
Converting an int to a binary string representation in Java? What would be the best way (ideally, simplest) to convert an int to a binary string representation in Java? For example, say the int is 156. The binary string representation of this would be "10011100".

How to check if a subclass is an instance of a class at runtime? In an android app test suite I have a class like this where B is a view: now I have a list of view objects which may contain A objects but in this case I only care if they're subclasses or "instances of" B. I'd like to do something like: this is an instance of B The problem is that when the if encounters an A object it doesn't evaluate to an "instance of B". Is there a way to do isSubclassOf or something?
When should I use "this" in a class? I know that this refers to a current object. But I do not know when I really need to use it. For example, will be there any difference if I use x instead of this.x in some of the methods? May be x will refer to a variable which is local for the considered method? I mean variable which is seen only in this method. What about this.method()? Can I use it? Should I use it. If I just use method(), will it not be, by default, applied to the current object?
NullPointerException in Java with no StackTrace I've had instances of our Java code catch a NullPointerException, but when I try to log the StackTrace (which basically ends up calling Throwable.printStackTrace() ), all I get is: Has anyone else come across this? I tried googling for "java null pointer empty stack trace" but didn't come across anything like this.
Why is it bad practice to call System.gc()? After answering a question about how to force-free objects in Java (the guy was clearing a 1.5GB HashMap) with System.gc(), I was told it's bad practice to call System.gc() manually, but the comments were not entirely convincing. In addition, no one seemed to dare to upvote, nor downvote my answer. I was told there that it's bad practice, but then I was also told that garbage collector runs don't systematically stop the world anymore, and that it could also effectively be used by the JVM only as a hint, so I'm kind of at loss. I do understand that the JVM usually knows better than you when it needs to reclaim memory. I also understand that worrying about a few kilobytes of data is silly. I also understand that even megabytes of data isn't what it was a few years back. But still, 1.5 gigabytes? And you know there's like 1.5 GB of data hanging around in memory; it's not like it's a shot in the dark. Is System.gc() systematically bad, or is there some point at which it becomes okay? So the question is actually double: Why is or isn't it bad practice to call System.gc()? Is it really merely a hint to the JVM under certain implementations, or is it always a full collection cycle? Are there really garbage collector implementations that can do their work without stopping the world? Please shed some light over the various assertions people have made in the comments to my answer. Where's the threshold? Is it never a good idea to call System.gc(), or are there times when it's acceptable? If so, what are those times?
How to define a List bean in Spring? I'm using Spring to define stages in my application. It's configured that the necessary class (here called Configurator) is injected with the stages. Now I need the List of Stages in another class, named LoginBean. The Configurator doesn't offer access to his List of Stages. I cannot change the class Configurator. My Idea: Define a new bean called Stages and inject it to Configurator and LoginBean. My problem with this idea is that I don't know how to transform this property: into a bean. Something like this does not work: Can anybody help me with this?

In contrast to double backslash \\ platform independence seems not to be the reason, since both versions work under Windows and Unix. is exists assertThat To rephrase the question, if / works on Unix and Windows, why should one ever want to use File.separator?
How to avoid Dependency Injection constructor madness? I find that my constructors are starting to look like this: with ever increasing parameter list. Since "Container" is my dependency injection container, why can't I just do this: for every class? What are the downsides? If I do this, it feels like I'm using a glorified static. Please share your thoughts on IoC and Dependency Injection madness.
Static Initialization Blocks As far as I understood the "static initialization block" is used to set values of static field if it cannot be done in one line. But I do not understand why we need a special block for that. For example we declare a field as static (without a value assignment). And then write several lines of the code which generate and assign a value to the above declared static field. Why do we need this lines in a special block like: static {...}?

How to upload files to server using JSP/Servlet? How can I upload files to server using JSP/Servlet? I tried this: However, I only get the file name, not the file content. When I add enctype="multipart/form-data" to the <form>, then request.getParameter() returns null. During research I stumbled upon Apache Common FileUpload. I tried this: This line is where it died. Unfortunately, the servlet threw an exception without a clear message and cause. Here is the stacktrace:
Volatile Vs Static in java Is it correct to say that static means one copy of the value for all objects and volatile means one copy of the value for all threads? Anyway a static variable value is also going to be one value for all threads, then why should we go for volatile?
What is a Java ClassLoader? In a few simple sentences, what is a Java ClassLoader, when is it used and why? OK, I read a wiki article. ClassLoader loads classes. OK. So if I include jar files and import, a ClassLoader does the job. Why should I bother with this ClassLoader? I've never used it and didn't know it existed. The question is, why does the ClassLoader class exist? And also, how do you use it in practice? (Cases exist, I know.)

Use of class definitions inside a method in Java Example: I found out that the above piece of code is perfectly legal in Java. I have the following questions. What is the use of ever having a class definition inside a method? Will a class file be generated for DummyClass Its hard for me to imagine this concept in an Object Oriented manner. Having a class definition inside a behavior. Probably can someone tell me with equivalent real world examples. Abstract classes inside a method sounds a bit crazy to me. But no interfaces allowed. Is there any reason behind this?
Java - when to use 'this' keyword What is the best practise for using the this keyword in Java? For example, I have the following class: That's fine and all, but Java is clever enough to know what is happening if I change the statement in the constructor to So why use the this keyword? (I realise in some situations, it's totally necessary to use it, I'm just asking for situations like this). Actually, I tend to use the keyword purely for readability sake but what's the common practise? Using it all over the shop makes my code look a bit messy, for example Obviously a poor bit of code but it illustrates my example. Is it just down to personal preference in these cases?
In Java how does one turn a String into a char or a char into a String? Is there a way to turn a char into a String or a String with one letter into a char (like how you can turn an int into a double and a double into an int)?

Best practice for passing many arguments to method? Occasionally , we have to write methods that receive many many arguments , for example : When I encounter this kind of problem , I often encapsulate arguments into a map. extracting params This is not a good practice , encapsulate params into a map is totally a waste of efficiency. The good thing is , the clean signature , easy to add other params with fewest modification . what's the best practice for this kind of problem ?
Difference of Maven JAXB plugins I have determined that two JAXB plugins for Maven 2 exist, with some different configurations. The one is from Sun: http://jaxb.dev.java.net/jaxb-maven2-plugin/, the other from Mojohaus: http://mojohaus.org/jaxb2-maven-plugin/ Which of these two plugins can be recommended? Thanks Matt. On my little research project, I found that there's quite another plugin comming from the sunners: and that one: and still the one from Codehouse.

How to change context root of a dynamic web project in Eclipse? I have developed a dynamic web project in Eclipse. Now I can access it through my browser using the following URL: Now I want to change the access URL to I changed the context root from the project "Properties | Web Project Settings | Context Root". But it is not working. The web app still has the access URL as earlier. I have re-deployed the application on Tomcat, re-started the Tomcat and have done everything that should be done, but the access URL is the same as earlier. I found that there were no server.xml file attached with the WAR file. Then how the Tomcat is determining that the context root of my web app is /MyDynamicWebApp and is allowing me to access the application through that URL?

Android Color Picker Does anyone know of a quick color picker widget that I could grab to use in my application? I've seen one in a few different applications that have a wheel with colors, and that you tap in the center to select, but I'm not sure where to find it. Any color picker would be fine though.
How to set JFrame to appear centered, regardless of monitor resolution? While working with Java, I find it hard to position my main window in the center of the screen when I start the application. Is there any way I can do that? It doesn't have to be vertically centered, horizontal alignment is the more important goal for me. But vertical alignment is also welcome.
How do I make my ArrayList Thread-Safe? Another approach to problem in Java? I have an ArrayList that I want to use to hold RaceCar objects that extend the Thread class as soon as they are finished executing. A class, called Race, handles this ArrayList using a callback method that the RaceCar object calls when it is finished executing. The callback method, addFinisher(RaceCar finisher), adds the RaceCar object to the ArrayList. This is supposed to give the order in which the Threads finish executing. I know that ArrayList isn't synchronized and thus isn't thread-safe. I tried using the Collections.synchronizedCollection(c Collection) method by passing in a new ArrayList and assigning the returned Collection to an ArrayList. However, this gives me a compiler error: Here is the relevant code: Make an ArrayList to hold RaceCar objects to determine winners Fill array with RaceCar objects Add this as a RaceListener to each RaceCar Implement the one method in the RaceListener interface What I need to know is, am I using a correct approach and if not, what should I use to make my code thread-safe? Thanks for the help!

Convert Existing Eclipse Project to Maven Project For a project at work, we're considering using the Maven plugin for Eclipse to automate our builds. Right now the procedure is far more complicated than it ought to be, and we're hoping that Maven will simplify things to a one-click build. My question is, is there a wizard or automatic importer for converting an existing Eclipse Java project to a Maven project, using the Maven plugin? Or should I create a new Maven project and manually copy over all source files, libs, etc.

Executable war file that starts jetty without maven I'm trying to make an "executable" war file (java -jar myWarFile.war) that will start up a Jetty webserver that hosts the webapp contained in the WAR file I executed. I found a page that described how to make what I'm looking for: However, following that advice along with how I think I'm supposed to make an executable jar (war) isn't working. I have an Ant task creating a WAR file with a manifest that looks like: The contents of the WAR file look like: When I try to execute the WAR file, the error is: There appears to be two errors here: one where it seems the JAR files can't be found, and one where the Start class can't be found. To fix the first one, I put the Jetty JAR files in the base of the WAR file and tried again -- same error. I also tried adding the WEB-INF/lib/<specific-JAR-files> to the Class-Path attribute of the manifest. That did not work either. Does anyone have any insight as to what I'm doing right/wrong and how I can get this executable WAR file up and running?
Enum.values() vs EnumSet.allOf( ). Which one is more preferable? I looked under the hood for EnumSet.allOf and it looks very efficient, especially for enums with less than 64 values. Basically all sets share the single array of all possible enum values and the only other piece of information is a bitmask which in case of allOf is set in one swoop. On the other hand Enum.values() seems to be a bit of black magic. Moreover it returns an array, not a collection, so in many cases it must be decorated with Arrays.asList( ) to be usable in any place that expects collection. So, should EnumSet.allOf be more preferable to Enum.values? More specifically, which form of for iterator should be used: or
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Bad version number in .class file? I am getting this error when I include an opensource library that I had to compile from source. Now, all the suggestions on the web indicate that the code was compiled in one version and executed in another version (new on old). However, I only have one version of JRE on my system. If I run the commands: and check in Eclipse for the properties of the java library, I get 1.5.0_18 Therefore, I have to conclude something else, internal to a class itself, is throwing the exception?? Is that even possible?
How do I assert my exception message with JUnit Test annotation? I have written a few JUnit tests with @Test annotation. If my test method throws a checked exception and if I want to assert the message along with the exception, is there a way to do so with JUnit @Test annotation? AFAIK, JUnit 4.7 doesn't provide this feature but does any future versions provide it? I know in .NET you can assert the message and the exception class. Looking for similar feature in the Java world. This is what I want:
Set margins in a LinearLayout programmatically I'm trying to use Java (not XML) to create a LinearLayout with buttons that fill the screen, and have margins. Here is code that works without margins: Verbose! This is critical. Doesn't work without it. So that works fine, but how on earth do you give the buttons margins so there is space between them? I tried using LinearLayout.MarginLayoutParams, but that has no weight member so it's no good. And it doesn't work if you pass it lp in its constructor either. Is this impossible? Because it sure looks it, and it wouldn't be the first Android layout task you can only do in XML.
How can I avoid garbage collection delays in Java games? (Best Practices) I'm performance tuning interactive games in Java for the Android platform. Once in a while there is a hiccup in drawing and interaction for garbage collection. Usually it's less than one tenth of a second, but sometimes it can be as large as 200ms on very slow devices. I am using the ddms profiler (part of the Android SDK) to search out where my memory allocations come from and excise them from my inner drawing and logic loops. The worst offender had been short loops done like, where every single time the loop was executed there was an iterator allocated. I'm using arrays (ArrayList) for my objects now. If I ever want trees or hashes in an inner loop I know that I need to be careful or even reimplement them instead of using the Java Collections framework since I can't afford the extra garbage collection. That may come up when I'm looking at priority queues. I also have trouble where I want to display scores and progress using Canvas.drawText. This is bad, because Strings, char arrays and StringBuffers will be allocated all over to make it work. If you have a few text display items and run the frame 60 times a second that begins to add up and will increase your garbage collection hiccups. I think the best choice here is to keep char[] arrays and decode your int or double manually into it and concatenate strings onto the beginning and end. I'd like to hear if there's something cleaner. I know there must be others out there dealing with this. How do you handle it and what are the pitfalls and best practices you've discovered to run interactively on Java or Android? These gc issues are enough to make me miss manual memory management, but not very much.
What is the Java string pool and how is "s" different from new String("s")? What is meant by String Pool? And what is the difference between the following declarations: Is there any difference between the storing of these two strings by the JVM?
Shortcut "or-assignment" (|=) operator in Java I have a long set of comparisons to do in Java, and I'd like to know if one or more of them come out as true. The string of comparisons was long and difficult to read, so I broke it up for readability, and automatically went to use a shortcut operator |= rather than negativeValue = negativeValue || boolean. I expect negativeValue to be true if any of the default<something> values are negative. Is this valid? Will it do what I expect? I couldn't see it mentioned on Sun's site or stackoverflow, but Eclipse doesn't seem to have a problem with it and the code compiles and runs. Similarly, if I wanted to perform several logical intersections, could I use &= instead of &&?

Android Reading from an Input stream efficiently I am making an HTTP get request to a website for an android application I am making. I am using a DefaultHttpClient and using HttpGet to issue the request. I get the entity response and from this obtain an InputStream object for getting the html of the page. I then cycle through the reply doing as follows: However this is horrendously slow. Is this inefficient? I'm not loading a big web page - www.cokezone.co.uk so the file size is not big. Is there a better way to do this? Thanks Andy
How to set a JVM TimeZone Properly I am trying to run a Java program, but it is taking a default GMT timezone instead of an OS defined timezone. My JDK version is 1.5 and the OS is Windows Server Enterprise (2007) Windows has a Central timezone specified, but when I run the following program, it gives me a GMT time. println getTime getTimeZone getInstance java.util.Calendar Here is the output Please note that I do not want to set the timezone from the application. I want that the timezone used by JVM should be the one specified in the OS. (I am not finding this issues with other servers that have version 1.4 of JDK and Microsoft Server 2003). Any thoughts would be highly appreciated.
Eclipse: Should I create a workspace for each project? I am simply wondering whether it is best to put all of my Eclipse projects into one workspace, or do a 1 workspace per 1 project. I am just a solo developer, for hobby more or less, but the apps I create do actually have production versions that are running on rather frequent cron jobs, so its almost like an amateur production environment. The only problems I have noticed so far is for exporting JARs, I have the potential to include source files from other projects which seems like it could get messy.
Java EE 6 vs. Spring 3 stack I'm starting a new project now. I have to choose technologies. I need something light, so no EJB or Seam. On the other hand I need JPA (Hibernate or alternative) and JSF with IceFaces. Do you think that such a stack on Spring 3 deployed on Tomcat is a good choice? Or a Java EE 6 web application could be better? I'm afraid that Java EE 6 is a new technology, not well documented yet. Tomcat seems to be easier to maintain than Glassfish 3. What's your opinion? Do you have any experiences?
Specify JDK for Maven to use I am trying to build a Hudson plugin I've modified and it requires jdk1.6. This is fine, but I don't see how I can tell maven where the different jdk is. I've found few mentions on the internet but they don't seem to apply to me. Some suggest adding some config to .m2/settings.xml but I don't have a settings.xml. Plus, I don't want to use 1.6 for all maven builds. One kink is I am using mvn in cygwin, if that matters at all. It appears I should be able to make the specification in the project pom file, but the existing pom is pretty bare. So bottom line is, is there a way to specify a jdk for a single invocation of maven?

Is there a way to specify a default property value in Spring XML? We are using a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer to use java properties in our Spring configuration (details here) eg: We would like to add an additional property, but have a distributed system where existing instances could all use a default value. Is there a way to avoid updating all of our properties files, by indicating a default value in the Spring config for when there isn't an overriding property value defined?
how good is java's UUID.randomUUID? I know that randomized UUIDs have a very, very, very low probability for collision in theory, but I am wondering, in practice, how good is Java 5's randomUUID() in terms of not having collision? Does anybody have any experience to share?

Comparing two java.util.Dates to see if they are in the same day I need to compare two Dates (e.g. date1 and date2) and come up with a boolean sameDay which is true of the two Dates share the same day, and false if they are not. How can I do this? There seems to be a whirlwind of confusion here... and I would like to avoid pulling in other dependencies beyond the JDK if at all possible. to clarify: if date1 and date2 share the same year, month, and day, then sameDay is true, otherwise it is false. I realize this requires knowledge of a timezone... it would be nice to pass in a timezone but I can live with either GMT or local time as long as I know what the behavior is. again, to clarify:
How to get Locale from its String representation in Java? Is there a neat way of getting a Locale instance from its "programmatic name" as returned by Locale's toString() method? An obvious and ugly solution would be parsing the String and then constructing a new Locale instance according to that, but maybe there's a better way / ready solution for that? The need is that I want to store some locale specific settings in a SQL database, including Locales themselves, but it would be ugly to put serialized Locale objects there. I would rather store their String representations, which seem to be quite adequate in detail.

How to convert a JSON string to a Map with Jackson JSON This is my first time trying to do something useful with Java.. I'm trying to do something like this but it doesn't work: But the IDE says: 'Unchecked assignment Map to Map<String,String>' What's the right way to do this? I'm only using Jackson because that's what is already available in the project, is there a native Java way of converting to/from JSON? In PHP I would simply json_decode($str) and I'd get back an array. I need basically the same thing here. Thanks!
Analogues of Java and .NET technologies/frameworks I work in a shop that is a mix of mostly Java and .NET technologists. When discussing new solutions and architectures we often encounter impedance in trying to compare the various technologies, frameworks, APIs etc. in use between the two camps. It seems that each camp knows little about the other and we end up comparing apples to oranges and forgetting about the bushels. While researching the topic I found this: Java --> .Net rough equivalents It's a nice list but it's not quite exhaustive and is missing the key .NET 3.0 technologies and a few other tidbits. To complete that list: what are the near/rough equivalents (or a combination of technologies) in Java to the following in .NET? WCF ~= WPF ~= Silverlight ~= WF ~= Generics ~= Extension Methods ~= Lambda expressions ~= Linq (not Linq-to-SQL) ~= TPL ~= F# ~= IronPython ~= IronRuby ~= ...have i missed anything else? Java Technologies (are there .NET equivalents?): ~= EJB ~= WebSphere ~= GlassFish ~= JBoss App Server ~= Tomcat? Note that I omitted technologies that are already covered in the linked article. I would also like to hear feedback on whether the linked article is accurate. Note: This seems to be turning into a wiki-type article so i marked it as such.
Why do Java programmers like to name a variable "clazz"? I've seen lots of codes have declaration like Class clazz , where does this originate from ? Is this some kind of convention ?

A file handler and my own console handler. Both of my handlers work fine. My logging is send to a file and to the console . My logging is also sent to the default console handler, which i do not want. If you run my code you will see extra two line sent to the console. I don't want to use the default console handler. Does anyone know how to disable the default console handler. I only want to use the two handlers I have created. getSourceMethodName addHandler append java.util.Date java.util.logging.Level setFormatter java.util.logging.LogManager java.util.logging.LogRecord java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler addLogger getMessage getProperty getSourceClassName java.util.logging.FileHandler getLogManager toString printStackTrace getLogger setLevel java.util.logging.Formatter java.util.logging.Handler info java.util.logging.Logger getLevel
List all files from a directory recursively with Java I have this function that prints the name of all the files in a directory recursively. The problem is that my code is very slow because it has to access a remote network device with every iteration. My plan is to first load all the files from the directory recursively and then after that go through all files with the regex to filter out all the files I don't want. Does anyone have a better suggestion? This is just a test later on I'm not going to use the code like this, instead I'm going to add the path and modification date of every file which matches an advanced regex to an array.

How to gracefully handle the SIGKILL signal in Java How do you handle clean up when the program receives a kill signal? For instance, there is an application I connect to that wants any third party app (my app) to send a finish command when logging out. What is the best say to send that finish command when my app has been destroyed with a kill -9? edit 1: kill -9 cannot be captured. Thank you guys for correcting me. edit 2: I guess this case would be when the one calls just kill which is the same as ctrl-c
Is there a goto statement in Java? I'm confused about this. Most of us have been told that there isn't any goto statement in Java. But I found that it is one of the keywords in Java. Where can it be used? If it can not be used, then why was it included in Java as a keyword?
Foreign key constraints in Android using SQLite? on Delete cascade I have two tables: tracks and waypoints, a track can have many waypoints, but a waypoint is assigned to only 1 track. In the way points table I have a column called "trackidfk" which inserts the track_ID once a track is made, however I have not setup Foreign Key constraints on this column. When I delete a track I want to delete the assigned waypoints, is this possible?. I read about using Triggers but I don't think they are supported in Android. To create the waypoints table:
Java: random long number in 0 <= x < n range Random class has a method to generate random int in a given range. For example: This would generate an int number more or equal to 0 and less than 100. I'd like to do exactly the same with long number. Random class has only nextLong(), but it doesn't allow to set range.

Converting List to String[] in Java How do I convert a list into an array? The following code returns an error. Error:
Interview question: Check if one string is a rotation of other string A friend of mine was asked the following question today at interview for the position of software developer: Given two string s1 and s2 how will you check if s1 is a rotated version of s2 ? Example: If s1 = "stackoverflow" then the following are some of its rotated versions: where as "stackoverflwo" is not a rotated version. The answer he gave was: Take s2 and find the longest prefix that is a sub string of s1, that will give you the point of rotation. Once you find that point, break s2 at that point to get s2a and s2b, then just check if concatenate(s2a,s2b) == s1 It looks like a good solution to me and my friend. But the interviewer thought otherwise. He asked for a simpler solution. Please help me by telling how would you do this in Java/C/C++ ? Thanks in advance.
what are good blogs to read relating java, spring, hibernate, maven?

Java - JPA - @Version annotation How does @Version annotation work in JPA? I found various answers whose extract is as follows: JPA uses a version field in your entities to detect concurrent modifications to the same datastore record. When the JPA runtime detects an attempt to concurrently modify the same record, it throws an exception to the transaction attempting to commit last. But I am still not sure how it works. Also as from the following lines: You should consider version fields immutable. Changing the field value has undefined results. Does it mean that we should declare our version field as final?

simpledateformat parsing date with 'Z' literal I am trying to parse a date that looks like this: This is a valid date per http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt. The 'Z' literal "imply that UTC is the preferred reference point for the specified time." If I try to parse it using SimpleDateFormat and this pattern: It will be parsed as a Mon Apr 05 17:16:00 EDT 2010 SimpleDateFormat is unable to parse the string with these patterns: I can explicitly set the TimeZone to use on the SimpleDateFormat to get the expected output, but I don't think that should be necessary. Is there something I am missing? Is there an alternative date parser?
In a bidirectional JPA OneToMany/ManyToOne association, what is meant by "the inverse side of the association"? In these examples on TopLink JPA Annotation Reference: Example 1-59 @OneToMany - Customer Class With Generics Example 1-60 @ManyToOne - Order Class With Generics It seems to me that the Customer entity is the owner of the association. However, in the explanation for the mappedBy attribute in the same document, it is written that: if the relationship is bidirectional, then set the mappedBy element on the inverse (non-owning) side of the association to the name of the field or property that owns the relationship as Example 1-60 shows. However, if I am not wrong, it looks like in the example, the mappedBy is actually specified on the owning side of the association, rather than the non-owning side. So my question is basically: In a bidirectional (one-to-many/many-to-one) association, which of the entities is the owner? How can we designate the One side as the owner? How can we designate the Many side as the owner? What is meant by "the inverse side of the association"? How can we designate the One side as the inverse? How can we designate the Many side as the inverse?
Is Catching a Null Pointer Exception a Code Smell? Recently a co-worker of mine wrote in some code to catch a null pointer exception around an entire method, and return a single result. I pointed out how there could've been any number of reasons for the null pointer, so we changed it to a defensive check for the one result. However, catching NullPointerException just seemed wrong to me. In my mind, Null pointer exceptions are the result of bad code and not to be an expected exception in the system. Are there any cases where it makes sense to catch a null pointer exception?

Java - Method name collision in interface implementation If I have two interfaces , both quite different in their purposes , but with same method signature , how do I make a class implement both without being forced to write a single method that serves for the both the interfaces and writing some convoluted logic in the method implementation that checks for which type of object the call is being made and invoke proper code ? In C# , this is overcome by what is called as explicit interface implementation. Is there any equivalent way in Java ?
How to check if my string is equal to null? I want to perform some action ONLY IF my string has a meaningful value. So, I tried this. and this and this and this and this And in all cases my program doSomething in spite on the fact that my string IS EMPTY. It equals to null. So, what is wrong with that? ADDED: I found the reason of the problem. The variable was declared as a string and, as a consequence, null assigned to this variable was transformed to "null"! So, if (!myString.equals("null")) works.

Converting array to list in Java How do I convert an array to a list in Java? I used the Arrays.asList() but the behavior (and signature) somehow changed from Java SE 1.4.2 (docs now in archive) to 8 and most snippets I found on the web use the 1.4.2 behaviour. For example: on 1.4.2 returns a list containing the elements 1, 2, 3 on 1.5.0+ returns a list containing the array spam In many cases it should be easy to detect, but sometimes it can slip unnoticed:

custom listview adapter getView method being called multiple times, and in no coherent order I have a custom list adapter: in the overridden 'getView' method I do a print to check what position is and whether it is a convertView or not: The output of this (when the list is first displayed, no user input as yet) AFAIK, though I couldn't find it stated explicitly, getView() is only called for visible rows. Since my app starts with four visible rows at least the position numbers cycling from 0-3 makes sense. But the rest is a mess: Why is getview called for each row three times? Where are these convertViews coming from when I haven't scrolled yet? I did a bit of reseach, and without getting a good answer, I did notice that people were associating this issue with layout issues. So in case, here's the layout that contains the list: and the layout of each individual row: Thank you for your time
How to set java_home on Windows 7? I went to the Environment Variables in 'System' in the control panel and made two new variables, one for user variables and one for system variables.

Setting log level of message at runtime in slf4j When using log4j, the Logger.log(Priority p, Object message) method is available and can be used to log a message at a log level determined at runtime. We're using this fact and this tip to redirect stderr to a logger at a specific log level. slf4j doesn't have a generic log() method that I can find. Does that mean there's no way to implement the above?
Is an "infinite" iterator bad design? Is it generally considered bad practice to provide Iterator implementations that are "infinite"; i.e. where calls to hasNext() always(*) return true? Typically I'd say "yes" because the calling code could behave erratically, but in the below implementation hasNext() will return true unless the caller removes all elements from the List that the iterator was initialised with; i.e. there is a termination condition. Do you think this is a legitimate use of Iterator? It doesn't seem to violate the contract although I suppose one could argue it's unintuitive. (Pedantic) EDIT Some people have commented how an Iterator could be used to generate values from an unbounded sequence such as the Fibonacci sequence. However, the Java Iterator documentation states that an Iterator is: An iterator over a collection. Now you could argue that the Fibonacci sequence is an infinite collection but in Java I would equate collection with the java.util.Collection interface, which offers methods such as size() implying that a collection must be bounded. Therefore, is it legitimate to use Iterator as a generator of values from an unbounded sequence?
Good Hash Function for Strings I'm trying to think up a good hash function for strings. And I was thinking it might be a good idea to sum up the unicode values for the first five characters in the string (assuming it has five, otherwise stop where it ends). Would that be a good idea, or is it a bad one? I am doing this in Java, but I wouldn't imagine that would make much of a difference.

I seem to be spoilt by Spring in which all this is too obvious.
Best approach for GPGPU/CUDA/OpenCL in Java? General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is a very attractive concept to harness the power of the GPU for any kind of computing. I'd love to use GPGPU for image processing, particles, and fast geometric operations. Right now, it seems the two contenders in this space are CUDA and OpenCL. I'd like to know: Is OpenCL usable yet from Java on Windows/Mac? What are the libraries ways to interface to OpenCL/CUDA? Is using JNA directly an option? Am I forgetting something? Any real-world experience/examples/war stories are appreciated.
fastest (low latency) method for Inter Process Communication between Java and C/C++ I have a Java app, connecting through TCP socket to a "server" developed in C/C++. both app & server are running on the same machine, a Solaris box (but we're considering migrating to Linux eventually). type of data exchanged is simple messages (login, login ACK, then client asks for something, server replies). each message is around 300 bytes long. Currently we're using Sockets, and all is OK, however I'm looking for a faster way to exchange data (lower latency), using IPC methods. I've been researching the net and came up with references to the following technologies: shared memory pipes queues as well as what's referred as DMA (Direct Memory Access) but I couldn't find proper analysis of their respective performances, neither how to implement them in both JAVA and C/C++ (so that they can talk to each other), except maybe pipes that I could imagine how to do. can anyone comment about performances & feasibility of each method in this context ? any pointer / link to useful implementation information ? EDIT / UPDATE following the comment & answers I got here, I found info about Unix Domain Sockets, which seem to be built just over pipes, and would save me the whole TCP stack. it's platform specific, so I plan on testing it with JNI or either juds or junixsocket. next possible steps would be direct implementation of pipes, then shared memory, although I've been warned of the extra level of complexity... thanks for your help
JUnit confusion: use 'extends TestCase' or '@Test'? I've found the proper use (or at least the documentation) of JUnit very confusing. This question serves both as a future reference and as a real question. If I've understood correctly, there are two main approaches to create and run a JUnit test: Approach A (JUnit 3-style): create a class that extends TestCase, and start test methods with the word test. When running the class as a JUnit Test (in Eclipse), all methods starting with the word test are automatically run. assertEquals junit.framework.TestCase Approach B (JUnit 4-style): create a 'normal' class and prepend a @Test annotation to the method. Note that you do NOT have to start the method with the word test. org.junit.Assert assertEquals org.junit Mixing the two seems not to be a good idea, see e.g. this stackoverflow question: Now, my questions(s): What is the preferred approach, or when would you use one instead of the other? Approach B allows for testing for exceptions by extending the @Test annotation like in @Test(expected = ArithmeticException.class). But how do you test for exceptions when using approach A? When using approach A, you can group a number of test classes in a test suite like this: TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("All tests"); suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestA.class); suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestAbis.class); But this can't be used with approach B (since each testclass should subclass TestCase). What is the proper way to group tests for approach B? Edit: I've added the JUnit versions to both approaches
How to create a project from existing source in Eclipse and then find it? I have created several .java files. All of them are located in one directory. I used a text editor to write these files. Now I want to switch to Eclipse. How can I do it? I have tried many ways. None of them works. ADDED: I think the common way is to have source in the eclipse folder called "workspace". So, how do I get my files in these directory. Should I use eclipse to create a new project from existing source and Eclipse will put all file to the workspace? Or I should manually copy all my files to the workspace? Where should I put my class files than? Should I create a subdirectory? With which name? ADDED 2: When I try to create a project with name "game", the eclipse writes me that a project with such name already exist. But how can I open this project? ADDED 3: In my "workspace" I have created a subdirectory called "game". I copied all my .java file into this subdirectory. Then with Eclipse I created a new project with the name game. As a result, Eclipse created .classpath and .project files in the directory "game". It also created bin and src subdirectories. And now I think it is not the correct way to go. The source files are supposed to be in the "src" directory. Right? And at the moment all my .java files are in the "workspace\game". ADDED 4: I did it other way around. With Eclipse I have created a new project with the name "game". As the result, Eclipse created a folder called "game" into folder "workspace". In "game" the folder I found "src" folder. I copied all my .java files into this folder. But now in the "Package Explorer" I cannot open "src" folder. So, how can I access my source files from Eclipse? Why Eclipse does not want to open the "src" folder?
Singleton design pattern vs Singleton beans in Spring container As we all know we have beans as singleton by default in Spring container and if we have a web application based on Spring framework then in that case do we really need to implement Singleton design pattern to hold global data rather than just creating a bean through spring. Please bear with me if I'm not able to explain what I actually meant to ask.
Why "no projects found to import"? I am trying to "import existing project into workspace". As the "root directory" I select the directory where all my .java (and .class) files are located. Eclipse writes me that "no projects are found to import". Why?
Programming Java 7 in Eclipse I installed JDK 7 and Eclipse 3.6M6. Then, I added JRE 7 as a new JRE execution environment in Eclipse, and set the compiler compliance level to Java 7. I can compile the following piece of code through command line using the javac that comes with JDK 7. java.util.Map java.util.HashMap But, Eclipse gives the following error messages. Incorrect number of arguments for type HashMap; it cannot be parameterized with arguments Try.java /TryJava7/src line 7 Java Problem Syntax error on token "<", ? expected after this token Try.java /TryJava7/src line 7 Java Problem Even though I've set the compliance level of the compiler to Java 7, it looks like Eclipse doesn't understand Java7 syntax yet. Is it possible to play with Java 7 in Eclipse? The following is the content of .classpath. And, the following is the content of .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs.
How does a ArrayList's contains() method evaluate objects? Say I create one object and add it to my ArrayList. If I then create another object with exactly the same constructor input, will the contains() method evaluate the two objects to be the same? Assume the constructor doesn't do anything funny with the input, and the variables stored in both objects are identical. true or false? Is this how the class should be implemented to have contains() return true?
Trusting all certificates using HttpClient over HTTPS Recently posted a question regarding the HttpClient over Https (found here). I've made some headway, but I've run into new issues.

Why doesn't Java Map extends Collection? I was surprised by the fact that Map<?,?> is not a Collection<?>. I thought it'd make a LOT of sense if it was declared as such: After all, a Map<K,V> is a collection of Map.Entry<K,V>, isn't it? So is there a good reason why it's not implemented as such? Thanks to Cletus for a most authoritative answer, but I'm still wondering why, if you can already view a Map<K,V> as Set<Map.Entries<K,V>> (via entrySet()), it doesn't just extend that interface instead. If a Map is a Collection, what are the elements? The only reasonable answer is "Key-value pairs" Exactly, interface Map<K,V> extends Set<Map.Entry<K,V>> would be great! but this provides a very limited (and not particularly useful) Map abstraction. But if that's the case then why is entrySet specified by the interface? It must be useful somehow (and I think it's easy to argue for that position!). You can't ask what value a given key maps to, nor can you delete the entry for a given key without knowing what value it maps to. I'm not saying that that's all there is to it to Map! It can and should keep all the other methods (except entrySet, which is redundant now)!
Google Guice vs. JSR-299 CDI / Weld Weld, the JSR-299 Contexts and Dependency Injection reference implementation, considers itself as a kind of successor of Spring and Guice. CDI was influenced by a number of existing Java frameworks, including Seam, Guice and Spring. However, CDI has its own, very distinct, character: more typesafe than Seam, more stateful and less XML-centric than Spring, more web and enterprise-application capable than Guice. But it couldn't have been any of these without inspiration from the frameworks mentioned and lots of collaboration and hard work by the JSR-299 Expert Group (EG). http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/1.html What makes Weld more capable for enterprise application compared to Guice? Are there any advantages or disadvantages compared to Guice? What do you think about Guice AOP compared to Weld interceptors? What about performance? My choice In the end I decided to use Guice because I like the clean programming model which comes almost without annotations besides @Inject by default. It is much easier to use external libs with Guice than with CDI. AOP is also pretty simple with Guice.

Make $JAVA_HOME easily changable in Ubuntu In Ubuntu, I'd like to switch my JAVA_HOME environment variable back and forth between Java 5 and 6. I open a terminal and type in the following to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable: And in that same terminal window, I type the following to check that the environment variable has been updated: And I see /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun which is what I'm expecting to see. In addition, I modify ~/.profile and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun. And now for the problem--when I open a new terminal window and I check my JAVA_HOME environment variable by typing in echo $JAVA_HOME I see that my JAVA_HOME environment variable has been reverted back to Java 6. When I reboot my machine (or log out and back in, I suppose) the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to Java 5 (presumably because of the modification I made in my ~/.profile). Is there a way around this so that I can change my JAVA_HOME environment without having to log out and back in (AND make that environment variable change stick in all new terminal windows)?

Java - How to find the redirected url of a url? I am accessing web pages through java as follows: But in some cases, a url redirects to another url. So I want to know the url to which the previous url redirected. Below are the header fields that I got as a response: So at present, I am constructing the redirected url from the value of the Set-Cookie header field. In the above case, the redirected url is copenhagen.craigslist.org Is there any standard way through which I can determine which url the particular url is going to redirect. I know that when a url redirects to other url, the server sends an intermediate response containing a Location header field that tells the redirected url but I am not receiving that intermediate response through the url.openConnection(); method.
What is the use of interface constants? I am learning Java and just found that the Interface can have fields, which are public static and final. I haven't seen any examples of these so far. What are some of the use cases of these Interface Constants and can I see some in the Java Standard Library?
Is it bad to explicitly compare against boolean constants e.g. if (b == false) in Java? Is it bad to write: ... ... Is it always better to instead write: ... ... Presumably there is no difference in performance (or is there?), but how do you weigh the explicitness, the conciseness, the clarity, the readability, etc between the two? Update To limit the subjectivity, I'd also appreciate any quotes from authoritative coding style guidelines over which is always preferable or which to use when. Note: the variable name b is just used as an example, ala foo and bar.
Launching Google Maps Directions via an intent on Android My app needs to show Google Maps directions from A to B, but I don't want to put the Google Maps into my application - instead, I want to launch it using an Intent. Is this possible? If yes, how?
How to detect a loop in a linked list? Say you have a linked list structure in Java. It's made up of Nodes: some user data and each Node points to the next node, except for the last Node, which has null for next. Say there is a possibility that the list can contain a loop - i.e. the final Node, instead of having a null, has a reference to one of the nodes in the list which came before it. What's the best way of writing which would return true if the given Node is the first of a list with a loop, and false otherwise? How could you write so that it takes a constant amount of space and a reasonable amount of time? Here's a picture of what a list with a loop looks like:
Java Concurrency: CAS vs Locking I'm reading the Book Java Concurrency in Practice. In chapter 15, they are talking about the nonblocking algorithms and the compare-and-swap (CAS) method. It is written that CAS perform much better than the locking methods. I want to ask the people who already worked with both of these concepts and would like to hear when you are preferring which one of these concepts? Is it really so much faster? For me, the usage of locks is much clearer and easier to understand and maybe even better to maintain (please correct me if I am wrong). Should we really focus on creating our concurrent code related to CAS than locks to get a better performance boost or is sustainability more important? I know there is maybe not a strict rule when to use what. But I just would like to hear some opinions, experiences with the new concept of CAS.
Practical advice on using Jersey and Guice for RESTful service From what I can find online, the state of the art for Guice + Jersey integration has stagnated since 2008 when it appears both teams reached an impasse. The crux of the issue is that JAX-RS annotations perform field and method injection and this doesn't play nicely with Guice's own dependency injection. A few examples which I've found don't go far enough to elucidate: Iqbalyusuf's post on Jersey + Guice on Google App Engine Java suffers from a lot of boilerplate (manually getting and calling the injector). I want binding and injection should happen behind the scenes via Guice annotations. Jonathan Curran's article Creating a RESTful service with Jersey, Guice, and JSR-250 gave me hope because it's much more current (2010), but went no further than showing how to start up a Jersey service inside of a Guice ServletModule. However, there are no examples of doing any real dependency injection. I suppose that was left as an exercise for the reader. Curran's post may in fact be the correct first step towards wiring up Guice and Jersey and so I plan on starting with that. tantalizingly James Strachan writes: JAX-RS works well with dependency injection frameworks such as Spring, Guice, GuiceyFruit or JBossMC - you can basically pick whichever one you prefer. But I see no evidence that is true from a practitioner's point of view. What I find lacking are practical examples and explanations on how to combine JAX-RS and Guice annotations. For instance: I believe I cannot use constructor injection with any resource as Jersey wants to control this I'm uncertain whether I can combine @Inject with @PathParam, @QueryParam, et al. How to use injection in a MessageBodyWriter implementation Does anyone have examples, preferably with source, of non-trivial application which combines Jersey and Guice without sacrificing one or the other in the process? I'm keeping on this road regardless, but the bits and pieces on the Jersey and Guice lists makes me think I'm repeating the work of others who came before me.

Java: when to use static methods I am wondering when to use static methods? Say if I have a class with a few getters and setters, a method or two, and I want those methods only to be invokable on an instance object of the class. Does this mean I should use a static method? e.g or (is this the static way?) I'm rather confused!
Distributed sequence number generation? I've generally implemented sequence number generation using database sequences in the past. e.g. Using Postgres SERIAL type http://www.neilconway.org/docs/sequences/ I'm curious though as how to generate sequence numbers for large distributed systems where there is no database. Does anybody have any experience or suggestions of a best practice for achieving sequence number generation in a thread safe manner for multiple clients?

How to find an available port? I want to start a server which listen to a port. I can specify port explicitly and it works. But I would like to find a port in an automatic way. In this respect I have two questions. In which range of port numbers should I search for? (I used ports 12345, 12346, and 12347 and it was fine). How can I find out if a given port is not occupied by another software?
Naming convention for utility classes in Java When writing utility classes in Java, what are some good guidelines to follow? Should packges be "util" or "utils"? Is it ClassUtil or ClassUtils? When is a class a "Helper" or a "Utility"? Utility or Utilities? Or do you use a mixture of them? The standard Java library uses both Utils and Utilities: javax.swing.Utilities javax.print.attribute.AttributeSetUtilities javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicGraphicsUtils Apache uses a variety of Util and Utils, although mostly Utils: org.apache.commons.modeler.util.DomUtil org.apache.commons.modeler.util.IntrospectionUtils org.apache.commons.io.FileSystemUtils org.apache.lucene.wordnet.AnalyzerUtil org.apache.lucene.util.ArrayUtil org.apache.lucene.xmlparser.DOMUtils Spring uses a lot of Helper and Utils classes: org.springframework.web.util.UrlPathHelper org.springframework.core.ReflectiveVisitorHelper org.springframework.core.NestedExceptionUtils org.springframework.util.NumberUtils So, how do you name your utility classes?
Catching java.lang.OutOfMemoryError? Documentation for java.lang.Error says: An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch But as java.lang.Error is a subclass of java.lang.Throwable, I can catch this type of Throwable. I understand why it's not good idea to catch this sort of exception. As far as I understand, if we decide to catch it, the catch handler should not allocate any memory by itself. Otherwise OutOfMemoryError will be thrown again. So, my question is: Is there any real word scenarios when catching java.lang.OutOfMemoryError may be a good idea? If we decide to catch java.lang.OutOfMemoryError, how can we sure that catch handler doesn't allocate any memory by itself (any tools or best practices)?
Is there anyway to exclude artifacts inherited from a parent POM? Artifacts from dependencies can be excluded by declaring an <exclusions> element inside a <dependency> But in this case it's needed to exclude an artifact inherited from a parent project. An excerpt of the POM under discussion follows: base artifact, depends on javax.mail:mail-1.4.jar, and ALL-DEPS depends on another version of the same library. Due to the fact that mail.jar from ALL-DEPS exist on the execution environment, although not exported, collides with the mail.jar that exists on the parent, which is scoped as compile. A solution could be to rid off mail.jar from the parent POM, but most of the projects that inherit base, need it (as is a transtive dependency for log4j). So What I would like to do is to simply exclude parent's library from the child project, as it could be done if base was a dependency and not the parent pom:
Get query from java.sql.PreparedStatement In my code I am using java.sql.PreparedStatement. I then execute the setString() method to populate the wildcards of the prepared statement. Is there a way for me to retrieve (and print out) the final query before the executeQuery() method is called and the query is executed? I Just want this for debugging purposes.
Why would I use Scala/Lift over Java/Spring? I know this question is a bit open but I have been looking at Scala/Lift as an alternative to Java/Spring and I wonder what are the real advantages that Scala/Lift has over it. From my perspective and experience, Java Annotations and Spring really minimizes the amount of coding that you have to do for an application. Does Scala/Lift improve upon that?

What is the difference between the add and offer methods in a Queue in Java? Take the PriorityQueue for example http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html#offer(E) Can anyone give me an example of a Queue where the add and offer methods are different? According to the Collection doc, the add method will often seek to ensure that an element exists within the Collection rather than adding duplicates. So my question is, what is the difference between the add and offer methods? Is it that the offer method will add duplicates regardless? (I doubt that it is because if a Collection should only have distinct elements this would circumvent that). EDIT: In a PriorityQueue the add and offer methods are the same method (see my answer below). Can anyone give me an example of a class where the add and offer methods are different?
Why is Go so slow (compared to Java)? As we can see from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game: Go is on average 10x slower than C Go is 3x slower than Java !? How can this be, bearing in mind that Go compiler produces native code for execution? Immature compilers for Go? Or there is some intrinsic problem with the Go language? EDIT: Most answers deny intrinsic slowness of Go languge, claiming the problem resides in immature compilers. Therefore I've made some own tests to calculate Fibonacci numbers: Iterative algorithm runs in Go (freebsd,6g) with the same speed as in C (with O3 option). The dull recursive one runs in Go 2 times slower than in C (with -O3 option; with -O0 - the same). But I haven't seen 10x fall as in the Benchmarks Game.

Converting a string to an integer on Android How do I convert a string into an integer? I have a textbox I have the user enter a number into: And the value is assigned to the string hello. I want to convert it to a integer so I can get the number they typed; it will be used later on in code. Is there a way to get the EditText to a integer? That would skip the middle man. If not, string to integer will be just fine.

Determine file creation date in Java There is another similar question to mine on StackOverflow (How to get creation date of a file in Java), but the answer isn't really there as the OP had a different need that could be solved via other mechanisms. I am trying to create a list of the files in a directory that can be sorted by age, hence the need for the file creation date. I haven't located any good way to do this after much trawling of the web. Is there a mechanism for getting file creation dates? BTW, currently on a Windows system, may need this to work on a Linux system as well. Also, I can't guarantee that a file naming convention would be followed where the creation date/time is embedded in the name.
Date object to Calendar [Java] I have a class Movie in it i have a start Date, a duration and a stop Date. Start and stop Date are Date Objects (private Date startDate ...) (It's an assignment so i cant change that) now i want to automatically calculate the stopDate by adding the duration (in min) to the startDate. By my knowledge working with the time manipulating functions of Date is deprecated hence bad practice but on the other side i see no way to convert the Date object to a calendar object in order to manipulate the time and reconvert it to a Date object. Is there a way? And if there is what would be best practice Thanks in advance Samuel

Why is there no Constant feature in Java? I was trying to identify the reason behind constants in Java I have learned that Java allows us to declare constants by using final keyword. My question is why didn't Java introduce a Constant (const) feature. Since many people say it has come from C++, in C++ we have const keyword. Please share your thoughts.
How to pass an object from one activity to another on Android I am trying to work on sending an object of my customer class from one Activity and display it in another Activity.

Output in a table format in Java's System.out I'm getting results from a database and want to output the data as a table in Java's standard output I've tried using \t but the first column I want is very variable in length. Is there a way to display this in a nice table like output?
Is List a subclass of List? Why aren't Java's generics implicitly polymorphic? I'm a bit confused about how Java generics handle inheritance / polymorphism. Assume the following hierarchy - Animal (Parent) Dog - Cat (Children) So suppose I have a method doSomething(List<Animal> animals). By all the rules of inheritance and polymorphism, I would assume that a List<Dog> is a List<Animal> and a List<Cat> is a List<Animal> - and so either one could be passed to this method. Not so. If I want to achieve this behavior, I have to explicitly tell the method to accept a list of any subset of Animal by saying doSomething(List<? extends Animal> animals). I understand that this is Java's behavior. My question is why? Why is polymorphism generally implicit, but when it comes to generics it must be specified?
Alternatives to JSP for Spring MVC view layer I'm looking to create a new app from scratch and will probably use Spring MVC and possibly Spring Web Flow. The projects created by Spring Roo use Spring MVC and optionally Web Flow. What are some good alternatives for view technology, or is JSP with Spring and JSTL taglibs and jQuery the way to go?
How is Java platform-independent when it needs a JVM to run? I just started learning Java and I'm confused about the topic of platform independence. Doesn't "independent" imply that Java code should run on any machine and need no special software to be installed? Yet the JVM needs to be present in the machine. For example, we need to have the Turbo C Compiler in order to compile C/C++ source code and then execute it. The machine has to have the C compiler. Could somebody please what is meant when Java is described as "platform independent"?
Map enum in JPA with fixed values? I'm looking for the different ways to map an enum using JPA. I especially want to set the integer value of each enum entry and to save only the integer value. the enum to map : A simple solution is to use the Enumerated annotation with EnumType.ORDINAL: But in this case JPA maps the enum index (0,1,2) and not the value I want (100,200,300). Th two solutions I found do not seem simple... First Solution A solution, proposed here, uses @PrePersist and @PostLoad to convert the enum to an other field and mark the enum field as transient: Second Solution The second solution proposed here proposed a generic conversion object, but still seems heavy and hibernate-oriented (@Type doesn't seem to exist in Java EE): Is there any other solutions ? I've several ideas in mind but I don't know if they exist in JPA: use the setter and getter methods of right member of Authority Class when loading and saving the Authority object an equivalent idea would be to tell JPA what are the methods of Right enum to convert enum to int and int to enum Because I'm using Spring, is there any way to tell JPA to use a specific converter (RightEditor) ?

Developing for Android in Eclipse: R.java not regenerating I've found out that my R.java is never updated, so it doesn't contain information about my new resources, so I decided to delete it and thought that Eclipse would generate a new one. But that didn't happen, and I don't have R.java now. How can I regenerate one? I'm using Windows 7. From one of the comments: "Doing Project -> Clean is what caused the problem for me. Cleaning deletes R.java...and for whatever reason the plugin is not regenerating the file."

Any comments? interrupt cancel remove put shutdown java.util.concurrent newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor java.util.List schedule shutdownNow
ArrayList initialization equivalent to array initialization I am aware that you can initialize an array during instantiation as follows: Is there a way to do the same thing with an ArrayList? Or must I add the contents individually with array.add()?
Java Compare Two Lists I have two lists ( not java lists, you can say two columns) For example I'd like a method that returns how many elements are same. For this example it should be 3 and it should return me similar values of both list and different values too. Should I use hashmap if yes then what method to get my result? Please help P.S: It is not a school assignment :) So if you just guide me it will be enough
Why use a singleton instead of static methods? I've never found good answers to these simple questions about helper/utility classes: Why would I create a singleton (stateless) instead of using static methods? Why would an object instance be needed if an object has no state?
How to get the first non-null value in Java? Is there a Java equivalent of SQL's COALESCE function? That is, is there any way to return the first non-null value of several variables? e.g. I want to somehow have a statement that will return the first non-null value of a, b, and c - in this case, it would return b, or 4.4. (Something like the sql method - return COALESCE(a,b,c)). I know that I can do it explicitly with something like: But I wondered if there was any built-in, accepted function to accomplish this.
What is Dispatcher Servlet in Spring? In this image (which I got from here), HTTP request sends something to Dispatcher Servlet. My Question is what does Dispatcher Servlet do? Is it something like getting the information thrown from the web page and throwing it to the controller?
What is a raw type and why shouldn't we use it? Questions: What are raw types in Java, and why do I often hear that they shouldn't be used in new code? What is the alternative if we can't use raw types, and how is it better?
Why is System.arraycopy native in Java? I was surprised to see in the Java source that System.arraycopy is a native method. Of course the reason is because it's faster. But what native tricks is the code able to employ that make it faster? Why not just loop over the original array and copy each pointer to the new array - surely this isn't that slow and cumbersome?
Difference between HashSet and HashMap? Apart from the fact that HashSet does not allow duplicate values, what is the difference between HashMap and Hashset? I mean implementation wise? It's a little bit vague because both use hash tables to store values.
How can I convert JSON to a HashMap using Gson? I'm requesting data from a server which returns data in the JSON format. Casting a HashMap into JSON when making the request wasn't hard at all but the other way seems to be a little tricky. The JSON response looks like this: What way would be easiest to access this data? I'm using the GSON module.
Why must wait() always be in synchronized block We all know that in order to invoke Object.wait(), this call must be placed in synchronized block, otherwise an IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown. But what's the reason for making this restriction? I know that wait() releases the monitor, but why do we need to explicitly acquire the monitor by making particular block synchronized and then release the monitor by calling wait()? What is the potential damage if it was possible to invoke wait() outside a synchronized block, retaining it's semantics - suspending the caller thread?
Why should Java ThreadLocal variables be static I was reading the JavaDoc for Threadlocal here http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html and it says "ThreadLocal instances are typically private static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread (e.g., a user ID or Transaction ID). " But my question is why did they choose to make it static (typically) - it makes things a bit confusing to have "per thread" state but the fields are static?
Sort ArrayList of custom Objects by property I read about sorting ArrayLists using a Comparator but in all of the examples people used compareTo which according to some research is a method for Strings. I wanted to sort an ArrayList of custom objects by one of their properties: a Date object (getStartDay()). Normally I compare them by item1.getStartDate().before(item2.getStartDate()) so I was wondering whether I could write something like:

Avoiding instanceof in Java Having a chain of "instanceof" operations is considered a "code smell". The standard answer is "use polymorphism". How would I do it in this case? There are a number of subclasses of a base class; none of them are under my control. An analogous situation would be with the Java classes Integer, Double, BigDecimal etc. I do have control over NumberStuff and so on. I don't want to use many lines of code where a few lines would do. (Sometimes I make a HashMap mapping Integer.class to an instance of IntegerStuff, BigDecimal.class to an instance of BigDecimalStuff etc. But today I want something simpler.) I'd like something as simple as this: But Java just doesn't work that way. I'd like to use static methods when formatting. The things I'm formatting are composite, where a Thing1 can contain an array Thing2s and a Thing2 can contain an array of Thing1s. I had a problem when I implemented my formatters like this: format Yes, I know the HashMap and a bit more code can fix that too. But the "instanceof" seems so readable and maintainable by comparison. Is there anything simple but not smelly? Note added 5/10/2010: It turns out that new subclasses will probably be added in the future, and my existing code will have to handle them gracefully. The HashMap on Class won't work in that case because the Class won't be found. A chain of if statements, starting with the most specific and ending with the most general, is probably the best after all: Handle all the methods and properties of SubClass1 Handle all the methods and properties of SubClass2 Unknown class but it implements Interface3 so handle those methods and properties likewise. May want to also handle case of object that implements both interfaces. New (unknown) subclass; do what I can with the base class
Using java.net.URLConnection to fire and handle HTTP requests Use of java.net.URLConnection is asked about pretty often here, and the Oracle tutorial is too concise about it. That tutorial basically only shows how to fire a GET request and read the response. It doesn't explain anywhere how to use it to among others perform a POST request, set request headers, read response headers, deal with cookies, submit a HTML form, upload a file, etc. So, how can I use java.net.URLConnection to fire and handle "advanced" HTTP requests?

Implementing two interfaces in a class with same method. Which interface method is overridden? Two interfaces with same method names and signatures. But implemented by a single class then how the compiler will identify the which method is for which interface? Ex: from which interface A or B
Constructor in an Interface? I know it's not possible to define a constructor in an interface. But I'm wondering why, because I think it could be very useful. So you could be sure that some fields in a class are defined for every implementation of this interface. For example consider the following message class: some implementation for sending the mssage to the receiver If a define an interface for this class so that I can have more classes which implement the message interface, I can only define the send method and not the constructor. So how can I ensure that every implementation of this class really has an receiver set? If I use a method like setReceiver(String receiver) I can't be sure that this method is really called. In the constructor I could ensure it.
Create a string with n characters Is there a way in java to create a string with a specified number of a specified character? In my case I would need to create a string with 10 spaces.

Is it bad practice to use Reflection in Unit testing? During the last years I always thought that in Java, Reflection is widely used during Unit testing. Since some of the variables/methods which have to be checked are private, it is somehow necessary to read the values of them. I always thought that the Reflection API is also used for this purpose. Last week i had to test some packages and therefore write some JUnit tests. As always i used Reflection to access private fields and methods. But my supervisor who checked the code wasn't really happy with that and told me that the Reflection API wasn't meant to use for such "hacking". Instead he suggested to modifiy the visibility in the production code. Is it really bad practice to use Reflection? I can't really believe that- Edit: I should have mentioned that i was required that all tests are in a separate package called test (so using protected visibilty e.g. wasn't a possible solution too)

Java: Difference between PrintStream and PrintWriter What is the difference between PrintStream and PrintWriter? They have many methods in common due to which I often mix these two classes up. Moreover, I think we can use them for exactly the same things. But there has to be a difference, otherwise, there would have been only one class. I have searched the archives, but couldn't find this question.

Building big, immutable objects without using constructors having long parameter lists I have some big (more than 3 fields) Objects which can and should be immutable. Every time I run into that case i tend to create constructor abominations with long parameter lists. It doesn't feel right, is hard to use and readability suffers. It is even worse if the fields are some sort of collection type like lists. A simple addSibling(S s) would ease the object creation so much but renders the object mutable. What do you guys use in such cases? I'm on Scala and Java, but i think the problem is language agnostic as long as the language is object oriented. Solutions I can think of: "Constructor abominations with long parameter lists" The Builder Pattern Thanks for your input!
Difference between try-finally and try-catch What's the difference between and Does something with throwable, logs it, or handles it.

Also, is there a way to access the exception from the finally clause?
How can I tell jaxb / Maven to generate multiple schema packages? Example: What happened: Maven executes the the first plugin. Then deletes the target folder and creates the second package, which then is visible. I tried to set target/somedir1 for the first configuration and target/somedir2 for the second configuration. But the behavior does not not change? Any ideas? I do not want to generate the packages directly in the src/main/java folder, because these packages are genereated and should not be mixed with manual created classes.
Difference between Java SE/EE/ME? Which one should I install when I want to start learning Java?

How do I create a file and write to it in Java? What's the simplest way to create and write to a (text) file in Java?
Is it a bad idea if equals(null) throws NullPointerException instead? The contract of equals with regards to null, is as follows: For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false. This is rather peculiar, because if o1 != null and o2 == null, then we have: returns false throws NullPointerException The fact that o2.equals(o1) throws NullPointerException is a good thing, because it alerts us of programmer error. And yet, that error would not be catched if for various reasons we just switched it around to o1.equals(o2), which would just "silently fail" instead. So the questions are: Why is it a good idea that o1.equals(o2) should return false instead of throwing NullPointerException? Would it be a bad idea if wherever possible we rewrite the contract so that anyObject.equals(null) always throw NullPointerException instead? On comparison with Comparable In contrast, this is what the Comparable contract says: Note that null is not an instance of any class, and e.compareTo(null) should throw a NullPointerException even though e.equals(null) returns false. If NullPointerException is appropriate for compareTo, why isn't it for equals? Related questions Comparable and Comparator contract with regards to null A purely semantical argument These are the actual words in the Object.equals(Object obj) documentation: Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one. And what is an object? JLS 4.3.1 Objects An object is a class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects, and a special null reference, which refers to no object. My argument from this angle is really simple. equals tests whether some other object is "equal to" this null reference gives no other object for the test Therefore, equals(null) should throw NullPointerException
Keystore change passwords I currently have a keystore, with a particular password that only I should know. I now need to give access to that keystore to someone else, so I would like to either: 1) Change the password, so I can share it with others and let them sign 2) Create a different password and allow them to sign with it. Is this possible? and - if yes - how?

Accept server's self-signed ssl certificate in Java client It looks like a standard question, but I couldn't find clear directions anywhere. I have java code trying to connect to a server with probably self-signed (or expired) certificate. The code reports the following error : As I understand it, I have to use keytool and tell java that it's OK to allow this connection. All instructions to fix this problem assume I'm fully proficient with keytool, such as generate private key for server and import it into keystore Is there anybody who could post detailed instructions? I'm running unix, so bash script would be best. Not sure if it's important, but code executed in jboss.

I found or thought of some notations, but nothing like a convention from sun or a general best-practice. Alternatives i guesed of or found...
Why are Python exceptions named "Error"? Why are Python exceptions named "Error" (e.g. ZeroDivisionError, NameError, TypeError) and not "Exception" (e.g. ZeroDivisionException, NameException, TypeException). I come from a Java background and started to learn Python recently, as such this is confusing because in Java there is a distinction between errors and exceptions. Is there a difference in Python also or not?

How to extract CN from X509Certificate in Java? I am using a SslServerSocket and client certificates and want to extract the CN from the SubjectDN from the client's X509Certificate. At the moment I call cert.getSubjectX500Principal().getName() but this of course gives me the total formatted DN of the client. For some reason I am just interested in the CN=theclient part of the DN. Is there a way to extract this part of the DN without parsing the String myself?
What is the default maximum heap size for Sun's JVM from Java SE 6? What is the default maximum heap size for Sun's JVM from Java SE 6 (i.e. equivalent to setting -Xmx)?

What's the reason I can't create generic array types in Java? What's the reason Java doesn't allow us to do I could understand .NET didn't allow us to do that, as in .NET you have value types that at run-time can have different sizes, but in Java all kinds of T will be object references, thus having the same size (correct me if I'm wrong). What is the reason?
Can you have 2 completely independent instances of Eclipse running at the same time? I'm sure there isn't really a way to do this, but figured it doesn't hurt to ask... I use Eclipse a lot. I'm currently using it for both Java and Python (with PyDev). I often find that I have one project open, with lots of files, say in Java... And then for some reason I have to switch to a Python project for a bit. I want to leave my Java project the way it is, and I don't just want to open tons of Python files in the same place because then I have too much open at once and get a headache and confused. Is there any way I can just leave the Java project exactly the way it is, and sort of open a completely new session of Eclipse? (sort of the way you can do with a browser) Or is this just wishful thinking?

Samples of Scala and Java code where Scala code looks simpler/has fewer lines? I need some code samples (and I also really curious about them) of Scala and Java code which show that Scala code is more simple and concise then code written in Java (of course both samples should solve the same problem). If there is only Scala sample with comment like "this is abstract factory in Scala, in Java it will look much more cumbersome" then this is also acceptable. Thanks! I like most of all accepted and this answers

assert vs. JUnit Assertions Today I saw a JUnit test case with a java assertion instead of the JUnit assertions—Are there significant advantages or disadvantages to prefer one over the other?
final transient fields and serialization Is it possible to have final transient fields that are set to any non-default value after serialization in Java? My usecase is a cache variable — that's why it is transient. I also have a habit of making Map fields that won't be changed (i.e. contents of the map is changed, but object itself remains the same) final. However, these attributes seem to be contradictory — while compiler allows such a combination, I cannot have the field set to anything but null after unserialization. I tried the following, without success: simple field initialization (shown in the example): this is what I normally do, but the initialization doesn't seem to happen after unserialization; initialization in constructor (I believe this is semantically the same as above though); assigning the field in readObject() — cannot be done since the field is final. In the example cache is public only for testing. println readObject java.io java.util writeObject toByteArray Output:

How can I interrupt a ServerSocket accept() method? In my main thread I have a while(listening) loop which calls accept() on my ServerSocket object, then starts a new client thread and adds it to a Collection when a new client is accepted. I also have an Admin thread which I want to use to issue commands, like 'exit', which will cause all the client threads to be shut down, shut itself down, and shut down the main thread, by turning listening to false. However, the accept() call in the while(listening) loop blocks, and there doesn't seem to be any way to interrupt it, so the while condition cannot be checked again and the program cannot exit! Is there a better way to do this? Or some way to interrupt the blocking method?

Getting a lightweight installation of Java Eclipse Having dealt with yet another stupid eclipse problem, I want to try to get the lightest, most minimal Eclipse installation as possible. To be clear, I use eclipse for two things: Editing Java Debugging Java Everything else I do through Emacs/Zsh (editing JSP/XML/JS, file management, SVN check-in, etc). I have not found any aspect of working in Eclipse to do these tasks to be efficient or even reliable, so I do not want plug-ins that relate to it. From the eclipse.org site, this is the lightest install of eclipse that they have, and I don't want any of those things (Bugzilla, Mylyn, CVS xml_ui), and have actually had problems with each of them even though I do not use them. So what is the minimal build I can get that will: Ignore SVN metadata Includes the full-featured editor (intellisense and type-finding) Includes the full-featured debugger (standard Eclipse/JDK) Does not have any extra plug-ins, platforms, or "integrations" with other platforms, specifically, I don't want to deal with plug-ins relating to: Maven, JSP Validation, Javascript editing or validation, CVS or SVN, Mylyn, Spring or Hibernate "natures", app servers like a bundled Tomcat/GlassFish/etc, J2EE tools, or anything of the like. I do primarily Spring/Hibernate/web-mvc apps, and have never dealt with an Eclipse plug-in that handles any of it gracefully, I can work effectively with my own toolset, but Eclipse extensions do nothing but get in the way. I have worked with plain eclipse up to Ganymede, MyEclipse (up to 7.5), and the latest version of Spring-SourceTools, and find that they are all saddled with buggy useless plug-ins (though the combination is always different). Switching to NetBeans/Intellij is not an option, and my teammates work with SVN-controlled .class/.project files, so it pretty much has to be Eclipse. Does anyone have any good advice on how I can save a few grey hairs?
Java Constructor Style (Check parameters aren't null) What are the best practices if you have a class which accepts some parameters but none of them are allowed to be null? The following is obvious but the exception is a little unspecific: ... Here the exceptions let you know which parameter is null, but the constructor is now pretty ugly: ... Here the constructor is neater, but now the constructor code isn't really in the constructor: setTwo setOne ... ... Which of these styles is best? Or is there an alternative which is more widely accepted?

What does the question mark in Java generics' type parameter mean? This is a small snippet of code taken from some of the examples that accompany the Stanford Parser. I've been developing in Java for about 4 years, but have never had a very strong understanding of what this style of code is supposed to indicate. I'm not worried about the details of the code. What I'm confused about is what exactly the generic expression is supposed to convey, in English. Can someone explain this to me?

Should I use something like Apache Commons Lang's StringEscapeUtilities.escapeHtml, StringEscapeUtilities.escapeXml, or should I use java.net.URLEncoder? The problem is that when I use SEU.escapeHtml, it doesn't escape quotes and when I wrap the whole string in a pair of 's, a malformed JSON will be generated.
